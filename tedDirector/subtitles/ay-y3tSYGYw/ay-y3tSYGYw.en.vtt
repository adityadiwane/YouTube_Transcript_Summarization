00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:15.171
Miranda Wang: We're here
to talk about accidents.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.603
How do you feel about accidents?

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:19.197
When we think about accidents,

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:21.388
we usually consider them to be harmful,

00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:25.715
unfortunate or even dangerous,
and they certainly can be.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.004
But are they always that bad?

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.648
The discovery that had led
to penicillin, for example,

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:34.085
is one of the most fortunate
accidents of all time.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.772
Without biologist Alexander
Fleming's moldy accident,

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:39.900
caused by a neglected workstation,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.252
we wouldn't be able to fight
off so many bacterial infections.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.181
Jeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.421
because we'd like to share
how our accidents

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:50.581
have led to discoveries.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:54.109
In 2011, we visited the Vancouver
Waste Transfer Station

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.618
and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.

00:00:57.642 --> 00:00:59.983
We realized that when
plastics get to the dump,

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.339
it's difficult to sort them
because they have similar densities,

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.363
and when they're mixed with organic matter

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.711
and construction debris,
it's truly impossible

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.765
to pick them out and environmentally
eliminate them.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.205
MW: However, plastics are useful

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.317
because they're durable, flexible,

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.589
and can be easily molded
into so many useful shapes.

00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:20.645
The downside of this convenience

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:23.054
is that there's a high cost to this.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.294
Plastics cause serious problems, such as

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.485
the destruction of ecosystems,

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.176
the pollution of natural resources,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.921
and the reduction of available land space.

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:34.565
This picture you see here
is the Great Pacific Gyre.

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:36.870
When you think about plastic pollution

00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:38.190
and the marine environment,

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.024
we think about the Great Pacific Gyre,

00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:43.213
which is supposed to be a floating
island of plastic waste.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.456
But that's no longer an accurate depiction

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.437
of plastic pollution
in the marine environment.

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:52.148
Right now, the ocean is actually
a soup of plastic debris,

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:54.421
and there's nowhere you
can go in the ocean

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.912
where you wouldn't be able
to find plastic particles.

00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:00.081
JY: In a plastic-dependent society,

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:03.060
cutting down production is a good
goal, but it's not enough.

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:06.301
And what about the waste
that's already been produced?

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:10.029
Plastics take hundreds to thousands
of years to biodegrade.

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:11.642
So we thought, you know what?

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.048
Instead of waiting for that garbage
to sit there and pile up,

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.464
let's find a way to break them down

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.522
with bacteria.

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:21.156
Sounds cool, right?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.947
Audience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.269
But we had a problem.

00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:27.973
You see, plastics have
very complex structures

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.117
and are difficult to biodegrade.

00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:32.298
Anyhow, we were curious and hopeful

00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:33.918
and still wanted to give it a go.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:36.104
MW: With this idea in mind,
Jeanny and I read through

00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:38.693
some hundreds of scientific
articles on the Internet,

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:40.965
and we drafted a research proposal

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.213
in the beginning of our grade 12 year.

00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:46.471
We aimed to find bacteria
from our local Fraser River

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:50.062
that can degrade a harmful
plasticizer called phthalates.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.848
Phthalates are additives used
in everyday plastic products

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:57.281
to increase their flexibility,
durability and transparency.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.213
Although they're part of the plastic,

00:02:59.237 --> 00:03:01.865
they're not covalently bonded
to the plastic backbone.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.845
As a result, they easily
escape into our environment.

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.479
Not only do phthalates
pollute our environment,

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.412
but they also pollute our bodies.

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:12.418
To make the matter worse,
phthalates are found in products

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:16.194
to which we have a high
exposure, such as babies' toys,

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:20.684
beverage containers, cosmetics,
and even food wraps.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:22.540
Phthalates are horrible because

00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:24.665
they're so easily taken into our bodies.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.003
They can be absorbed by skin
contact, ingested, and inhaled.

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:32.915
JY: Every year, at least 470
million pounds of phthalates

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.304
contaminate our air, water and soil.

00:03:36.328 --> 00:03:37.995
The Environmental Protection Agency

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.956
even classified this group
as a top-priority pollutant

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.012
because it's been shown to cause
cancer and birth defects

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.408
by acting as a hormone disruptor.

00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:49.194
We read that each year,
the Vancouver municipal government

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.606
monitors phthalate
concentration levels in rivers

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.356
to assess their safety.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.666
So we figured, if there
are places along our Fraser River

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.749
that are contaminated with phthalates,

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:01.963
and if there are bacteria
that are able to live in these areas,

00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:05.869
then perhaps, perhaps these
bacteria could have evolved

00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:07.965
to break down phthalates.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.037
MW: So we presented this good idea

00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.028
to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University
of British Columbia,

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.248
and surprisingly, he actually
took us into his lab

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.513
and asked his graduate students
Adam and James to help us.

00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:22.222
Little did we know at that time

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:25.807
that a trip to the dump
and some research on the Internet

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.300
and plucking up the courage
to act upon inspiration

00:04:28.324 --> 00:04:30.692
would take us on a life-changing journey

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:33.100
of accidents and discoveries.

00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:35.162
JY: The first step in our project

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:37.758
was to collect soil samples
from three different sites

00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:39.230
along the Fraser River.

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:42.103
Out of thousands of bacteria,
we wanted to find ones

00:04:42.127 --> 00:04:43.425
that could break down phthalates,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.584
so we enriched our cultures
with phthalates

00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:47.232
as the only carbon source.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:49.733
This implied that, if anything
grew in our cultures,

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:52.186
then they must be able
to live off of phthalates.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.076
Everything went well from there,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.229
and we became amazing scientists.
(Laughter)

00:04:57.253 --> 00:05:00.097
MW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.

00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:02.792
MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.

00:05:02.816 --> 00:05:05.962
You see, I accidentally cracked the flask

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:07.743
that had contained our third
enrichment culture,

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:10.588
and as a result, we had to wipe
down the incubator room

00:05:10.612 --> 00:05:12.292
with bleach and ethanol twice.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:15.078
And this is only one of the examples
of the many accidents

00:05:15.102 --> 00:05:17.303
that happened during our experimentation.

00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:20.803
But this mistake turned
out to be rather serendipitous.

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:23.019
We noticed that the unharmed cultures

00:05:23.043 --> 00:05:26.219
came from places
of opposite contamination levels,

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.751
so this mistake actually
led us to think that

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.411
perhaps we can compare

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:33.163
the different degradative
potentials of bacteria

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:37.134
from sites
of opposite contamination levels.

00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:39.060
JY: Now that we grew the bacteria,

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:42.396
we wanted to isolate strains
by streaking onto mediate plates,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.252
because we thought that would be

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:47.740
less accident-prone,
but we were wrong again.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.573
We poked holes in our agar while streaking

00:05:51.597 --> 00:05:53.842
and contaminated some samples and funghi.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.581
As a result, we had to streak
and restreak several times.

00:05:56.605 --> 00:05:59.249
Then we monitored phthalate utilization

00:05:59.273 --> 00:06:01.071
and bacterial growth,

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.711
and found that they shared
an inverse correlation,

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:06.298
so as bacterial populations increased,

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:08.136
phthalate concentrations decreased.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.168
This means that our bacteria were
actually living off of phthalates.

00:06:12.192 --> 00:06:15.383
MW: So now that we found bacteria
that could break down phthalates,

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:17.675
we wondered what these bacteria were.

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.366
So Jeanny and I took
three of our most efficient strains

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.123
and then performed gene
amplification sequencing on them

00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:26.251
and matched our data with an online
comprehensive database.

00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:27.924
We were happy to see that,

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:31.540
although our three strains had
been previously identified bacteria,

00:06:31.564 --> 00:06:34.563
two of them were not previously associated

00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:38.597
with phthalate degradation, so this
was actually a novel discovery.

00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:42.650
JY: To better understand
how this biodegradation works,

00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:46.302
we wanted to verify the catabolic
pathways of our three strains.

00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:49.214
To do this, we extracted
enzymes from our bacteria

00:06:49.238 --> 00:06:52.782
and reacted with an intermediate
of phthalic acid.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:55.934
MW: We monitored this experiment
with spectrophotometry

00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.179
and obtained this beautiful graph.

00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.589
This graph shows
that our bacteria really do have

00:07:00.613 --> 00:07:03.227
a genetic pathway
to biodegrade phthalates.

00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.589
Our bacteria can transform phthalates,
which is a harmful toxin,

00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:08.997
into end products such
as carbon dioxide, water

00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:10.236
and alcohol.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.403
I know some of you
in the crowd are thinking,

00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:15.258
well, carbon dioxide is horrible,
it's a greenhouse gas.

00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:18.552
But if our bacteria did not
evolve to break down phthalates,

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:21.148
they would have used some other
kind of carbon source,

00:07:21.172 --> 00:07:23.211
and aerobic respiration would have led it

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:26.523
to have end products such
as carbon dioxide anyway.

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:28.825
We were also interested to see that,

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.984
although we've obtained greater diversity

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:33.954
of bacteria biodegraders
from the bird habitat site,

00:07:33.978 --> 00:07:37.026
we obtained the most efficient
degraders from the landfill site.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.407
So this fully shows that nature evolves

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:42.648
through natural selection.

00:07:42.672 --> 00:07:44.745
JY: So Miranda and I shared this research

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:47.924
at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge
competition and were recognized

00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:50.960
with the greatest
commercialization potential.

00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:53.096
Although we're not the first
ones to find bacteria

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.597
that can break down phthalates,

00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:57.095
we were the first ones
to look into our local river

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.807
and find a possible solution
to a local problem.

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:03.108
We have not only shown that bacteria

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:06.520
can be the solution to plastic
pollution, but also that

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:09.821
being open to uncertain
outcomes and taking risks

00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:13.096
create opportunities
for unexpected discoveries.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.597
Throughout this journey, we have also
discovered our passion for science,

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.439
and are currently continuing research

00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:21.930
on other fossil fuel
chemicals in university.

00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:23.478
We hope that in the near future,

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.881
we'll be able to create model organisms

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.763
that can break down not only phthalates

00:08:27.787 --> 00:08:31.432
but a wide variety
of different contaminants.

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:34.128
We can apply this to wastewater
treatment plants

00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:35.616
to clean up our rivers

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.952
and other natural resources.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.491
And perhaps one day
we'll be able to tackle

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:44.529
the problem of solid plastic waste.

00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:46.864
MW: I think our journey
has truly transformed

00:08:46.888 --> 00:08:48.929
our view of microorganisms,

00:08:48.953 --> 00:08:50.477
and Jeanny and I have shown that

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:52.620
even mistakes can lead to discoveries.

00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:53.910
Einstein once said,

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:56.297
"You can't solve problems
by using the same kind

00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:59.565
