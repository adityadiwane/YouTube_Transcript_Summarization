00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:16.546
So, I guess it is a result
of globalization

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.174
that you can find Coca-Cola tins
on top of Everest

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:22.136
and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.534
(Laughter)

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.135
And so I just came,
two days ago, from the Himalayas

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.579
to your kind invitation.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.732
So I would like to invite you, also,
for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:43.350
And to show the place
where meditators, like me,

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:47.346
who began with being a molecular biologist
in Pasteur Institute,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.624
and found their way to the mountains.

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:56.811
So these are a few images
I was lucky to take and be there.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.768
There's Mount Kailash
in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.136
This is from Marlboro country.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.529
(Laughter)

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:13.055
This is a turquoise lake.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:15.160
A meditator.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:21.136
This is the hottest day of the year
somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.136
And the night before, we camped,
and my Tibetan friends said,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.741
"We are going to sleep outside."

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.008
And I said, "Why? We have
enough space in the tent."

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.856
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.549
(Laughter)

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.136
So now, we are going
to speak of happiness.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.955
As a Frenchman, I must say

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.027
that there are
a lot of French intellectuals

00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.112
that think happiness
is not at all interesting.

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:49.136
(Laughter)

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.685
I just wrote an essay on happiness,
and there was a controversy.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.960
And someone wrote an article saying,

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:58.010
"Don't impose on us
the dirty work of happiness."

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:59.136
(Laughter)

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.366
"We don't care about being happy.
We need to live with passion.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.741
We like the ups and downs of life.

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:09.207
We like our suffering because it's so good
when it ceases for a while."

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.802
(Laughter)

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.630
This is what I see from the balcony
of my hermitage in the Himalayas.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.539
It's about two meters by three,
and you are all welcome any time.

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.771
(Laughter)

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:27.257
Now, let's come
to happiness or well-being.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:33.136
And first of all, you know,
despite what the French intellectuals say,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.590
it seems that no one wakes up
in the morning thinking,

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.136
"May I suffer the whole day?"

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.495
(Laughter)

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.136
Which means that somehow,
consciously or not,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.509
directly or indirectly,
in the short or the long term,

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:53.035
whatever we do, whatever we hope,
whatever we dream --

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:58.865
somehow, is related to a deep, profound
desire for well-being or happiness.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:03.505
As Pascal said,
even the one who hangs himself,

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:07.783
somehow, is looking
for cessation of suffering.

00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:10.168
He finds no other way.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.645
But then, if you look
in the literature, East and West,

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.591
you can find incredible diversity
of definition of happiness.

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:24.136
Some people say, I only believed
in remembering the past,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.136
imagining the future, never the present.

00:03:26.617 --> 00:03:29.530
Some people say happiness is right now;

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:32.449
it's the quality of the freshness
of the present moment.

00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:37.679
And that led Henri Bergson,
the French philosopher, to say,

00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:41.558
"All the great thinkers of humanity
have left happiness in the vague

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:45.160
so that each of them
could define their own terms."

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Well, that would be fine if it was just
a secondary preoccupation in life.

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:54.930
But now, if it is something
that is going to determine

00:03:54.954 --> 00:03:57.731
the quality of every instant of our life,

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:01.750
then we better know what it is,
have some clearer idea.

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:08.136
And probably, the fact
that we don't know that is why, so often,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.425
although we seek happiness,
it seems we turn our back to it.

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.244
Although we want to avoid suffering,

00:04:13.268 --> 00:04:15.404
it seems we are running
somewhat towards it.

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.364
And that can also come
from some kind of confusions.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.730
One of the most common ones
is happiness and pleasure.

00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:27.736
But if you look at
the characteristics of those two,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.998
pleasure is contingent upon time,
upon its object,

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.420
upon the place.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
It is something that -- changes of nature.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.717
Beautiful chocolate cake:
first serving is delicious,

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.718
second one not so much,
then we feel disgust.

00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:49.517
(Laughter)

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.064
That's the nature of things.

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:52.288
We get tired.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.440
I used to be a fan of Bach.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:57.465
I used to play it on the guitar, you know.

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:59.298
I can hear it two, three, five times.

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:03.834
If I had to hear it 24 hours,
non-stop, it might be very tiring.

00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:08.212
If you are feeling very cold,
you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.

00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:10.752
After some moments,
you just go a little back,

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.097
and then it starts burning.

00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:16.316
It sort of uses itself
as you experience it.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.136
And also, again, it can --
also, it's something that you --

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.351
it is not something
that is radiating outside.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.641
Like, you can feel intense pleasure

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.615
and some others around you
can be suffering a lot.

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:35.136
Now, what, then, will be happiness?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.042
And happiness, of course, is such
a vague word, so let's say well-being.

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:45.900
And so, I think the best definition,
according to the Buddhist view,

00:05:45.924 --> 00:05:51.478
is that well-being is not just
a mere pleasurable sensation.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.208
It is a deep sense
of serenity and fulfillment.

00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:05.557
A state that actually pervades

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.302
and underlies all emotional states,

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:12.191
and all the joys and sorrows
that can come one's way.

00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:15.771
For you, that might be surprising.

00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:18.652
Can we have this kind of well-being
while being sad?

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:20.634
In a way, why not?

00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:24.160
Because we are speaking
of a different level.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.052
Look at the waves coming near the shore.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.891
When you are at the bottom
of the wave, you hit the bottom.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.761
You hit the solid rock.

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.430
When you are surfing on the top,
you are all elated.

00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:42.341
So you go from elation
to depression -- there's no depth.

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.921
Now, if you look at the high sea,

00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:50.368
there might be beautiful,
calm ocean, like a mirror.

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:52.815
There might be storms,

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.169
but the depth of the ocean
is still there, unchanged.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.136
So now, how is that?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.901
It can only be a state of being,
not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.671
Even joy -- that can be
the spring of happiness.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:12.225
But there's also wicked joy,
you can rejoice in someone's suffering.

00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:16.930
So how do we proceed
in our quest for happiness?

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.077
Very often, we look outside.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.074
We think that if we could gather
this and that, all the conditions,

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:29.136
something that we say,
"Everything to be happy --

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.416
to have everything to be happy."

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.856
That very sentence already reveals
the doom, destruction of happiness.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.135
To have everything.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.382
If we miss something, it collapses.

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:44.784
And also, when things go wrong,
we try to fix the outside so much,

00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:50.320
but our control
of the outer world is limited,

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:53.209
temporary, and often, illusory.

00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:57.224
So now, look at inner conditions.

00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:58.649
Aren't they stronger?

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:01.438
Isn't it the mind that translates

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:03.951
the outer condition
into happiness and suffering?

00:08:04.308 --> 00:08:06.136
And isn't that stronger?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.909
We know, by experience,

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:11.267
that we can be
what we call "a little paradise,"

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.300
and yet, be completely unhappy within.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.348
The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:21.136
and there was a lot of construction
going on everywhere.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
So one evening, he said,
"Look, you are doing all these things,

00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:27.136
but isn't it nice, also,
to build something within?"

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.136
And he said, "[Without] that --
even if you get a high-tech flat

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.410
on the 100th floor of a super-modern
and comfortable building,

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.136
if you are deeply unhappy within,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
all you are going to look for
is a window from which to jump."

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.136
So now, at the opposite,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.596
we know a lot of people who,
in very difficult circumstances,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.991
manage to keep serenity, inner strength,
inner freedom, confidence.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.399
So now, if the inner conditions
are stronger --

00:08:59.423 --> 00:09:02.046
of course, the outer
conditions do influence,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.654
and it's wonderful to live
longer, healthier,

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.471
to have access to information, education,

00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:10.448
to be able to travel, to have freedom.

00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:13.665
It's highly desirable.

00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:15.248
However, this is not enough.

00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:19.608
Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.

00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:23.942
The experience that translates
everything is within the mind.

00:09:24.643 --> 00:09:26.328
So then, when we ask oneself

00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:30.732
how to nurture
the condition for happiness,

00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:36.200
the inner conditions, and which are those
which will undermine happiness.

00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:39.944
So then, this just needs
to have some experience.

00:09:40.349 --> 00:09:43.404
We have to know from ourselves,
there are certain states of mind

00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:46.737
that are conducive to this flourishing,
to this well-being,

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.350
what the Greeks called
eudaimonia, flourishing.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:54.716
There are some which are adverse
to this well-being.

00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:59.464
And so, if we look
from our own experience,

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:03.697
anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,

00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.486
obsessive desire, strong grasping,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.263
they don't leave us in such a good state
after we have experienced it.

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:15.857
And also, they are detrimental
to others' happiness.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.846
So we may consider that the more
those are invading our mind,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.521
and, like a chain reaction,

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:26.778
the more we feel miserable,
we feel tormented.

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:31.249
At the opposite,
everyone knows deep within

00:10:31.273 --> 00:10:33.472
that an act of selfless generosity,

00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:37.781
if from the distance, without anyone
knowing anything about it,

00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:42.007
we could save a child's life,
make someone happy.

00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:45.581
We don't need the recognition.
We don't need any gratitude.

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:48.326
Just the mere fact of doing that

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.083
fills such a sense of adequation
with our deep nature.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.966
And we would like to be
like that all the time.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.741
So is that possible,

00:10:57.765 --> 00:11:01.365
to change our way of being,
to transform one's mind?

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.136
Aren't those negative emotions,
or destructive emotions,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.246
inherent to the nature of mind?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.230
Is change possible in our emotions,
in our traits, in our moods?

00:11:15.024 --> 00:11:17.602
For that we have to ask,
what is the nature of mind?

00:11:18.072 --> 00:11:22.634
And if we look from
the experiential point of view,

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:25.136
there is a primary
quality of consciousness

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.653
that's just the mere fact
to be cognitive, to be aware.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.820
Consciousness is like a mirror
that allows all images to rise on it.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.294
You can have ugly faces,
beautiful faces in the mirror.

00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:41.790
The mirror allows that,
but the mirror is not tainted,

00:11:41.814 --> 00:11:45.215
is not modified,
is not altered by those images.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.093
Likewise, behind every single thought

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:53.209
there is the bare consciousness,
pure awareness.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:55.282
This is the nature.

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:59.907
It cannot be tainted intrinsically
with hatred or jealousy because then,

00:11:59.931 --> 00:12:01.538
if it was always there --

00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:05.466
like a dye that would permeate
the whole cloth --

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.358
then it would be found
all the time, somewhere.

00:12:08.382 --> 00:12:12.235
We know we're not always angry,
always jealous, always generous.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.136
So, because the basic
fabric of consciousness

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.452
is this pure cognitive quality
that differentiates it from a stone,

00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:23.723
there is a possibility for change
because all emotions are fleeting.

00:12:24.302 --> 00:12:26.438
That is the ground for mind training.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.974
Mind training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors

00:12:31.998 --> 00:12:33.823
cannot happen at the same time.

00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:36.212
You could go from love to hate.

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:39.453
But you cannot, at the same time,
toward the same object,

00:12:39.477 --> 00:12:42.856
the same person, want to harm
and want to do good.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.603
You cannot, in the same gesture,
shake hand and give a blow.

00:12:47.587 --> 00:12:50.847
So, there are natural
antidotes to emotions

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.267
that are destructive
to our inner well-being.

00:12:54.603 --> 00:12:56.628
So that's the way to proceed.

00:12:57.106 --> 00:12:59.947
Rejoicing compared to jealousy.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.970
A kind of sense of inner freedom

00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:06.696
as opposite to intense
grasping and obsession.

00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:12.265
Benevolence, loving kindness
against hatred.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.145
But, of course, each emotion then
would need a particular antidote.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.136
Another way is to try to find
a general antidote to all emotions,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.286
and that's by looking at the very nature.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.499
Usually, when we feel annoyed,
hatred or upset with someone,

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:33.816
or obsessed with something,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.374
the mind goes again
and again to that object.

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.224
Each time it goes to the object,

00:13:38.248 --> 00:13:41.303
it reinforces that obsession
or that annoyance.

00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:45.146
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.

00:13:45.874 --> 00:13:47.634
So what we need to look for now is,

00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:50.247
instead of looking outward,
we look inward.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.344
Look at anger itself.

00:13:52.368 --> 00:13:53.906
It looks very menacing,

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.368
like a billowing monsoon cloud
or thunderstorm.

00:13:58.817 --> 00:14:01.080
We think we could sit on the cloud,

00:14:01.104 --> 00:14:03.160
but if you go there, it's just mist.

00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:06.627
Likewise, if you look
at the thought of anger,

00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:09.840
it will vanish like frost
under the morning sun.

00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:13.397
If you do this again
and again, the propensity,

00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:16.136
the tendencies for anger to arise again

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.014
will be less and less
each time you dissolve it.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:21.522
And, at the end, although it may rise,

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:23.136
it will just cross the mind,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.831
like a bird crossing the sky
without leaving any track.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.006
So this is the principal of mind training.

00:14:30.358 --> 00:14:33.863
Now, it takes time,

00:14:33.887 --> 00:14:40.858
because it took time for all those faults
in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,

00:14:40.882 --> 00:14:43.136
so it will take time
to unfold them as well.

00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:45.136
But that's the only way to go.

00:14:45.607 --> 00:14:49.398
Mind transformation --
that is the very meaning of meditation.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.136
It means familiarization
with a new way of being,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.814
new way of perceiving things,

00:14:54.838 --> 00:14:57.136
which is more in adequation with reality,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.136
with interdependence, with the stream
and continuous transformation,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.306
which our being and our consciousness is.

00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:06.096
So, the interface with cognitive science,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.280
since we need to come to that,
it was, I suppose, the subject of --

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:12.828
we have to deal in such a short time --
with brain plasticity.

00:15:12.852 --> 00:15:15.825
The brain was thought
to be more or less fixed.

00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:18.491
All the nominal connections,
in numbers and quantities,

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:21.456
were thought, until the last 20 years,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.947
to be more or less fixed
when we reached adult age.

00:15:25.384 --> 00:15:28.136
Now, recently, it has been found
that it can change a lot.

00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:32.557
A violinist, as we heard, who has done
10,000 hours of violin practice,

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:37.402
some area that controls the movements
of fingers in the brain changes a lot,

00:15:37.426 --> 00:15:40.378
increasing reinforcement
of the synaptic connections.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.734
So can we do that with human qualities?

00:15:44.758 --> 00:15:48.485
With loving kindness,
with patience, with openness?

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.276
So that's what those great
meditators have been doing.

00:15:53.378 --> 00:15:56.888
Some of them who came to the labs,

00:15:56.912 --> 00:16:00.812
like in Madison, Wisconsin,
or in Berkeley,

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:04.126
did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:08.464
They do, like, three years' retreat,
where they do meditate 12 hours a day.

00:16:08.488 --> 00:16:11.948
And then, the rest of their life,
they will do three or four hours a day.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:14.949
They are real Olympic
champions of mind training.

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:16.474
(Laughter)

00:16:17.974 --> 00:16:21.818
This is the place where the meditators --
you can see it's kind of inspiring.

00:16:21.842 --> 00:16:25.529
Now, here with 256 electrodes.

00:16:27.977 --> 00:16:30.669
(Laughter)

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.237
So what did they find?

00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:35.136
Of course, same thing.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.857
The scientific embargo --

00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:41.055
if it's ever submitted to "Nature,"
hopefully, it will be accepted.

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:45.397
It deals with the state of compassion,
unconditional compassion.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:49.136
We asked meditators, who have
been doing that for years and years,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.853
to put their mind in a state
where there's nothing but loving kindness,

00:16:53.877 --> 00:16:55.853
total availability to sentient being.

00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:58.937
Of course, during the training,
we do that with objects.

00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:01.247
We think of people suffering,
of people we love,

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:04.285
but at some point, it can be
a state which is all pervading.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.843
Here is the preliminary result,

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:10.197
which I can show
because it's already been shown.

00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:15.121
The bell curve shows 150 controls,

00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:17.334
and what is being looked at

00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:20.726
is the difference between the right
and the left frontal lobe.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.585
In very short, people
who have more activity

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.272
in the right side of the prefrontal cortex

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.289
are more depressed, withdrawn.

00:17:29.772 --> 00:17:32.422
They don't describe
a lot of positive affect.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.100
It's the opposite on the left side:

00:17:36.124 --> 00:17:38.136
more tendency to altruism,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.299
to happiness, to express,
and curiosity and so forth.

00:17:42.897 --> 00:17:46.990
So there's a basic line for people.
And also, it can be changed.

00:17:47.014 --> 00:17:49.538
If you see a comic movie,
you go off to the left side.

00:17:49.562 --> 00:17:52.978
If you are happy about something,
you'll go more to the left side.

00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:55.907
If you have a bout of depression,
you'll go to the right side.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:02.416
Here, the -0.5 is the full
standard deviation

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.136
of a meditator
who meditated on compassion.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.985
It's something that is totally out
of the bell curve.

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:13.136
So, I've no time to go
into all the different scientific results.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.698
Hopefully, they will come.

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:17.493
But they found that --
this is after three and a half hours

00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:19.460
in an fMRI,

00:18:19.484 --> 00:18:22.577
it's like coming out of a space ship.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.136
Also, it has been shown in other labs --

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.136
for instance,
Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.695
that some meditators are able, also,

00:18:32.719 --> 00:18:36.136
to control their emotional response
more than it could be thought.

00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.572
Like the startle experiments, for example.

00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:40.127
If you sit a guy on a chair

00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:42.580
with all this apparatus
measuring your physiology,

00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:44.572
and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,

00:18:44.596 --> 00:18:47.136
it's such an instinctive response that,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.752
in 20 years, they never saw
anyone who would not jump.

00:18:51.616 --> 00:18:54.136
Some meditators,
without trying to stop it,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.534
but simply by being completely open,

00:18:56.558 --> 00:19:02.136
thinking that that bang is just going
to be a small event like a shooting star,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.797
they are able not to move at all.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.136
So the whole point of that is not,
sort of, to make, like,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.961
a circus thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump, or whatever.

00:19:14.985 --> 00:19:17.832
It's more to say
that mind training matters.

00:19:18.351 --> 00:19:21.634
That this is not just a luxury.

00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:26.056
This is not a supplementary
vitamin for the soul.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.812
This is something
that's going to determine

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.897
the quality of every instant of our lives.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.541
We are ready to spend 15 years
achieving education.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.136
We love to do jogging, fitness.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.081
We do all kinds of things
to remain beautiful.

00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:50.049
Yet, we spend surprisingly little time
taking care of what matters most --

00:19:50.073 --> 00:19:52.317
the way our mind functions --

00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:56.088
which, again, is the ultimate thing

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:58.278
that determines
the quality of our experience.

00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:01.650
Now, compassion
is supposed to be put in action.

00:20:02.032 --> 00:20:04.471
That's what we try to do
in different places.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.811
Just this one example
is worth a lot of work.

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:12.338
This lady with bone TB,
left alone in a tent,

00:20:12.362 --> 00:20:15.093
was going to die with her only daughter.

00:20:15.588 --> 00:20:17.769
One year later, how she is.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.613
Different schools and clinics
we've been doing in Tibet.

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:30.845
And just, I leave you
with the beauty of those looks

00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:34.878
that tells more about happiness
than I could ever say.

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:36.045
(Laughter)

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.529
And jumping monks of Tibet.

00:20:37.553 --> 00:20:39.136
(Laughter)

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.808
Flying monks.

00:20:48.134 --> 00:20:49.300
Thank you very much.
