00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
This is a sculpture I made,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.160
which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.160
into an object that has different degrees of freedom.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.160
So, it can balance on a point.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
This is a bronze ball,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
an aluminum arm here,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
and then this wooden disk.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
And the wooden disk was really thought about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
as something that you'd want to hold on to,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and that would glide easily through your hands.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
The aluminum is because it's very light.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
The bronze is nice hard, durable material

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
that could roll on the ground.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Inside of the bronze ball

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
there's a lead weight

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
that is free-swinging on an axle

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
that's on two bearings

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
that pass in between, across it,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
like this, that counterbalance this weight.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
So it allows it to roll.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And the sphere has that balance property

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
that it always sort of stays still

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
and looks the same from every direction.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
But if you put something on top of it,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
But in this case because

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
the interior is free-swinging

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
in relation to the sphere,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
it can stand up on one point.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.160
And then there was a second level to this object,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
which is that it --

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
which is the diameter of the Moon

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
and the diameter of the Earth

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
in proportion to each other.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
I was exploring, really early on,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
wanting to make things float in the air.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And I thought up a lot of ideas.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160
This is sculpture that I made that --

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
it's magnetically levitated.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
without, um -- oops.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
So this is just floating,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
floating on a permanent magnetic field,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
which stabilizes it in all directions.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Except there is a slight tether here,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
which keeps it from going over the top of its field.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
at the crest of a wave.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
I think we could roll the tape, admin.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
I have a sort of a collection of videos

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
This is a sculpture of the Sun

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and the Earth, in proportion.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
Representing that eight and a half minutes

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
that was turned of solid bronze.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
And here is a similar sculpture.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
That's the Sun at that end.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And then in a series of 55 balls,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
it reduces, proportionately -- each ball

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
and the spaces between them

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
reduce proportionately,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
until they get down to this little Earth.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
This one is about the Moon

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.160
and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
This is a little stone ball, floating.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
As you can see the little tether,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
that it's also magnetically levitated.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
And then this is the first part of --

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
this is 109 spheres,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
And so this is the size of the Sun.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And then each of these little spheres

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
So this, again, is on the subject --

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
a slice from the equator of the Earth.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
And then the Moon in the center,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and it's floating. And this is in France.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
This is in Sapporo.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
which means that the lower half of the object

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
is just a little bit more weighty.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
So you can see it rotating here.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
This is another species of work that I do.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
but they have magnets horizontally in them

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
that make them all like compasses.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So as you turn around you're seeing different colors.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
This is based on the structure of a diamond.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
It was a diamond cell structure

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
was the point of departure.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
between the atoms.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
And so I placed one more element of each one of them.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
These were white spheres.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Then I had video projectors

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
So they would catch parts of the images,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
as you walk through it, through the object.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
This is something I did

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
of a tactile communication system.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
and then putting it into a communication system.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
that would be directed around the room

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
by a computer.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
This is a clock I designed.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And then, this is like

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
projects that are harder to build.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
(Laughter)

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
So it's a floating island

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
with water, fresh water,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
that can fly from place to place.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
This would be grown, I suppose,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
with nanotechnology in the future sometime.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
In the course of doing my work

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
I sort of have a broad range of interests.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And some of it is just the idea of creating media --

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
media as a sculpture,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
something that would keep the sculpture

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
fresh and ever-changing,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.160
by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
And I had a lot of --

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And the idea that you could see things

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
inside of a crystal ball and predict the future --

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
where anything can appear.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.160
I had thought about, a long time ago,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.160
in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160
grand project for an electric globe

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
across from the United Nations --

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
and other things that were happening,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
the space program at that time,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.160
So if we could roll the next film here.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
This has evolved over the years

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
in a lot of different iterations.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
But this the current version of it,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
is a flying airship

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
that is about 35 meters in diameter,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
about 110 feet in diameter.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
red, blue, and green,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
I came with a plan.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
to do a feasibility study,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
and they analyzed it,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.160
This is the control room inside of the ship.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
The idea of this air genie is,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
it's something that can just transform and become anything.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
It's like a traveling show.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
over the surface of it.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
So it can see its environment,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Here the legs are retracting.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
It weighs about 20 tons.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
It has on-board generators.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
It can generate about a million kilowatts,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.160
in order to be bright enough

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
to be visible in daylight.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160
It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
that would allow the thing to become

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
actually kind of a conscious object

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
that would respond to the moment,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
and to interact as an entity

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
that was aware, that could communicate.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
It's completely silent and nonpolluting.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.160
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.160
It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Primarily I would be interested in

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
how it would interact with, say,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
going to a college campus,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
the world, the situation of the globe.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
The default image on the object

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
But then one could interact with that

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.160
and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations --

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
all of the things that we're concerned with today.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
And then at night the idea is that

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
it would be used as kind of a rave situation,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
where the people could cut loose,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
and the music and the lights, and everything.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
So it could land in a park, for example.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
Or this could represent a college green.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And then it would have a corresponding website

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
that would show the itinerary of this.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
It would also be able to be an open code,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
so people could interact with it.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
It would be forum for people's ideas about

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
So that's pretty much it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
Okay. Thank you.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
(Applause)
