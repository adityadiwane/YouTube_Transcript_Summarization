00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
which is what we do research on at the University of California.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Just think about this problem for a second.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
which you can hold in the palm of your hand.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
about the nature of God.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
How does this all come about?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
We're looking at neurons here.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
with other neurons in the brain.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And based on this, people have calculated

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So, how do you go about studying the brain?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
One approach is to look at patients who had lesions

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Today I'll talk about a different approach,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Now, one recent discovery that has been made

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
by researchers in Italy, in Parma,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
is a group of neurons called mirror neurons,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Now, it turns out there are neurons

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
which have been known for over 50 years.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
commanding me to pull that object.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
But what Rizzolatti found was

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
a subset of these neurons,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And this is truly astonishing.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the other person's point of view.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
of the other person's action.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Because to imitate a complex act

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So, this is important for imitation and emulation.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Well, why is that important?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Well, let's take a look at the next slide.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
let's look at human evolution, it turns out

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
of a number of skills that are unique to human beings

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
like tool use,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
and the ability to read somebody else's mind

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and interpret that person's behavior.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
All of that happened relatively quickly.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Even though the human brain had achieved its present size

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
almost three or four hundred thousand years ago,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And I claim that what happened was

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
by one member of the group, say the use of fire,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
instead of Darwinian.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
A polar bear, to evolve a coat,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
kill another polar bear,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and learn it in one step. What the polar bear

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
took 100,000 years to learn,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And then once it's learned this it spreads

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in geometric proportion across a population.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
which is involved in something quite different.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And that is, there are mirror neurons,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
In other words, if somebody touches me,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
in the sensory region of the brain fires.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
when I simply watch another person being touched.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
So, it's empathizing the other person being touched.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
So, most of them will fire when I'm touched

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
in different locations. Different neurons for different locations.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
being touched in the same location.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So, here again you have neurons

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
which are enrolled in empathy.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
merely by watching somebody being touched?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
So, empathize, by all means, with the other person,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
but do not actually experience the touch,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
otherwise you'll get confused and muddled."

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Okay, so there is a feedback signal

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
so you put an injection into my arm,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
and there is no sensations coming in,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
if I now watch you being touched,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I literally feel it in my hand.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
In other words, you have dissolved the barrier

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
between you and other human beings.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.260
(Laughter)

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
All that's separating you from him,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
from the other person, is your skin.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and that is there is no real independent self,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
inspecting other people.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And there is no real distinctiveness

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
being touched, you feel it in your phantom.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Now the astonishing thing is,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
massage the other person's hand,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
that relieves the pain in your phantom hand,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
almost as though the neuron

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
were obtaining relief from merely

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
watching somebody else being massaged.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
So, here you have my last slide.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
For the longest time people have regarded science

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and humanities as being distinct.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
science on the one hand, humanities on the other;

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
never the twain shall meet.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
representation of self,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
what separates you from other human beings,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
what allows you to empathize with other human beings,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
which is unique to human beings. Thank you.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
(Applause)
