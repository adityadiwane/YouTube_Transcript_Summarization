00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.734
When, in 1960, still a student,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.159
I got a traveling fellowship

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.220
to study housing in North America.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.504
We traveled the country.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.609
We saw public housing high-rise buildings

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.950
in all major cities:

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.030
New York, Philadelphia.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.999
Those who have no choice lived there.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.294
And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.342
and I came back thinking,

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:40.996
we've got to reinvent the apartment building.

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:43.675
There has to be another way of doing this.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:45.710
We can't sustain suburbs,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.275
so let's design a building

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.518
which gives the qualities of a house

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:52.689
to each unit.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.850
Habitat would be all about gardens,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.755
contact with nature,

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.939
streets instead of corridors.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.737
We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:09.980
and there it is almost 50 years later.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.351
It's a very desirable place to live in.

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.810
It's now a heritage building,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.413
but it did not proliferate.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:24.117
In 1973, I made my first trip to China.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.383
It was the Cultural Revolution.

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:30.531
We traveled the country,

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.760
met with architects and planners.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.976
This is Beijing then,

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:38.848
not a single high rise building

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.132
in Beijing or Shanghai.

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:44.990
Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.269
There were hardly any cars.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.920
Thirty years later,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.915
this is Beijing today.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.628
This is Hong Kong.

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.128
If you're wealthy, you live there,

00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:00.548
if you're poor, you live there,

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.214
but high density it is, and it's not just Asia.

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.171
SÃ£o Paulo, you can travel

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:07.695
in a helicopter 45 minutes

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.705
seeing those high-rise buildings consume

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:12.341
the 19th-century low-rise environment.

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.652
And with it, comes congestion,

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:18.674
and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.224
So a few years ago, we decided to go back

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.138
and rethink Habitat.

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.827
Could we make it more affordable?

00:02:25.827 --> 00:02:28.890
Could we actually achieve this quality of life

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.297
in the densities that are prevailing today?

00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:36.160
And we realized, it's basically about light,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.222
it's about sun, it's about nature,

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:41.402
it's about fractalization.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:44.631
Can we open up the surface of the building

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.499
so that it has more contact with the exterior?

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.738
We came up with a number of models:

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:53.574
economy models, cheaper to build and more compact;

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.621
membranes of housing

00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.980
where people could design their own house

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.087
and create their own gardens.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:03.968
And then we decided to take New York as a test case,

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.015
and we looked at Lower Manhattan.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:09.840
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.215
On the left is Manhattan today:

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:17.602
blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.

00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:20.201
On the right, we reconfigured it:

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.518
the office buildings form the base,

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.781
and then rising 75 stories above,

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.160
are apartments.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.136
There's a street in the air on the 25th level,

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.150
a community street.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.759
It's permeable.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.712
There are gardens and open spaces

00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:37.156
for the community,

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:40.365
almost every unit with its own private garden,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:43.027
and community space all around.

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:46.187
And most important, permeable, open.

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:49.584
It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,

00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:52.419
and light permeates everywhere.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.076
And in the last two or three years,

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:56.648
we've actually been, for the first time,

00:03:56.648 --> 00:04:00.361
realizing the quality of life of Habitat

00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:04.068
in real-life projects across Asia.

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:07.302
This in Qinhuangdao in China:

00:04:07.302 --> 00:04:09.880
middle-income housing, where there is a bylaw

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.587
that every apartment must receive

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:15.343
three hours of sunlight.

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:18.233
That's measured in the winter solstice.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:21.660
And under construction in Singapore,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.882
again middle-income housing, gardens,

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:28.748
community streets and parks and so on and so forth.

00:04:28.748 --> 00:04:31.198
And Colombo.

00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:33.414
And I want to touch on one more issue,

00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:37.099
which is the design of the public realm.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.693
A hundred years after we've begun building

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.425
with tall buildings,

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.765
we are yet to understand

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:47.690
how the tall high-rise building

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.525
becomes a building block in making a city,

00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:53.348
in creating the public realm.

00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:55.767
In Singapore, we had an opportunity:

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:58.990
10 million square feet, extremely high density.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.112
Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor,

00:05:03.112 --> 00:05:05.363
promenades and parks integrated

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:07.545
with intense urban life.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:11.133
So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.110
and you move from one to the other,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.217
and there is contact with nature,

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:19.188
and most relevantly, at every level of the structure,

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:21.877
public gardens and open space:

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:23.643
on the roof of the podium,

00:05:23.643 --> 00:05:25.442
climbing up the towers,

00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:29.380
and finally on the roof, the sky park,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.754
two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:38.109
and the world's longest swimming pool.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.865
And that's all I can tell you in five minutes.

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:42.733
Thank you.

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:45.430
(Applause)
