Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter
important for the US right now

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.600
and in the world?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.840
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter
is our call to action.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.696
It is a tool to reimagine a world

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.936
where black people are free to exist,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.896
free to live.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520
It is a tool for our allies
to show up differently for us.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.360
I grew up in a neighborhood
that was heavily policed.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.176
I witnessed my brothers and my siblings

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.936
continuously stopped and frisked
by law enforcement.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.496
I remember my home being raided.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.416
And one of my questions
as a child was, why?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.640
Why us?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.920
Black Lives Matter
offers answers to the why.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.376
It offers a new vision
for young black girls around the world

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.336
that we deserve to be fought for,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.840
that we deserve to call
on local governments to show up for us.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.096
Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism --

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.336
(Applause)

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.376
And antiblack racism is not only
happening in the United States.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.136
It's actually happening
all across the globe.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.296
And what we need now more than ever
is a human rights movement

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.176
that challenges systemic racism
in every single context.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800
(Applause)

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.776
We need this because the global reality

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.216
is that black people
are subject to all sorts of disparities

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.016
in most of our most challenging
issues of our day.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.816
I think about issues like climate change,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.336
and how six of the 10 worst impacted
nations by climate change

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.720
are actually on the continent of Africa.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.776
People are reeling
from all sorts of unnatural disasters,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.616
displacing them
from their ancestral homes

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.000
and leaving them without a chance
at making a decent living.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.896
We also see disasters
like Hurricane Matthew,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.456
which recently wreaked havoc
in many different nations,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080
but caused the most damage to Haiti.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.016
Haiti is the poorest country
in this hemisphere,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.760
and its inhabitants are black people.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.736
And what we're seeing in Haiti

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.936
is that they were actually facing
a number of challenges

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.656
that even preceded this hurricane.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.536
They were reeling from the earthquake,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.736
they were reeling from cholera
that was brought in by UN peacekeepers

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920
and still hasn't been eradicated.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.696
This is unconscionable.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.616
And this would not happen if this nation
didn't have a population that was black,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.016
and we have to be real about that.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.216
But what's most heartening right now

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.416
is that despite these challenges,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.416
what we're seeing is
that there's a network of Africans

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.056
all across the continent

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.256
who are rising up and fighting back
and demanding climate justice.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.360
(Applause)

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.056
MB: So Alicia,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.856
you've said that when
black people are free,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.816
everyone is free.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.536
Can you talk about what that means?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.776
Alicia Garza: Sure.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.736
So I think race and racism
is probably the most studied

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.656
social, economic and political
phenomenon in this country,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.816
but it's also the least understood.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.616
The reality is that race
in the United States

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.576
operates on a spectrum
from black to white.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.976
Doesn't mean that people who are
in between don't experience racism,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.856
but it means that the closer
you are to white on that spectrum,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.176
the better off you are.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.176
And the closer to black
that you are on that spectrum

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.016
the worse off your are.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.856
When we think about
how we address problems in this country,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.616
we often start from a place
of trickle-down justice.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.456
So using white folks
as the control we say,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.623
well, if we make things
better for white folks

00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:18.727
then everybody else is going to get free.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.296
But actually it doesn't work that way.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.976
We have to address problems at the root,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.136
and when you deal with what's
happening in black communities,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.495
it creates an effervescence, right?

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:33.336
So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.096
Let me give an example.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.696
When we talk about the wage gap,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.216
we often say women make 78 cents
to every dollar that a man makes.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.096
You all have heard that before.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.336
But those are the statistics
for white women and white men.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.456
The reality is that black women
make something like 64 cents

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.400
to every 78 cents that white women make.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.016
When we talk about latinas,
it goes down to about 58 cents.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.136
If we were to talk about indigenous women,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.976
if we were to talk about trans women,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.896
it would even go further down.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.136
So again,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.536
if you deal with those
who are the most impacted,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.816
everybody has an opportunity
to benefit from that,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.856
rather than dealing with the folks
who are not as impacted,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.096
and expecting it to trickle down.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.696
MB: So I love the effervescence,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.936
bubbling up.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.696
AG: Effervescence -- like champagne.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.936
(Laughter)

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.296
MB: Who doesn't love
a glass of champagne, right?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.736
Champagne and freedom, right?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.016
(Laughter)

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.600
What more could we want, y'all?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.256
So you all have been
doing this for a minute,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.656
and the last few years have been --

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.016
well, I can't even imagine,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.416
but I'm sure very transformative.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.456
And I know that you all
have learned a lot about leadership.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.536
What do you want
to share with these people

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.616
about what you've learned
about leadership?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.136
Patrisse, let's start with you.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.736
PC: Yeah, we have to invest
in black leadership.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.416
That's what I've learned the most
in the last few years.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.776
(Applause)

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.776
What we've seen is thousands
of black people showing up for our lives

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.840
with very little infrastructure
and very little support.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.696
I think our work as movement leaders
isn't just about our own visibility

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.336
but rather how do we
make the whole visible.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.456
How do we not just fight
for our individual selves

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.296
but fight for everybody?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.656
And I also think

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.800
leadership looks like
everybody in this audience

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.776
showing up for black lives.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.016
It's not just about coming
and watching people on a stage, right?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.040
It's about how do you
become that leader --

00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:46.176
whether it's in your workplace,
whether it's in your home --

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.256
and believe that the movement
for black lives isn't just for us,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.680
but it's for everybody.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.976
(Applause)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.616
MB: What about you, Opal?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.416
OT: So I've been learning
a great deal about interdependence.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.376
I've been learning
about how to trust your team.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.016
I've come up with this new mantra

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.776
after coming back
from a three-month sabbatical,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.456
which is rare for black women to take
who are in leadership,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.856
but I felt it was really important
for my leadership and for my team

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.496
to also practice stepping back

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.600
as well as also sometimes stepping in.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.336
And what I learned in this process
was that we need to acknowledge

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.056
that different people
contribute different strengths,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.576
and that in order
for our entire team to flourish,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.736
we have to allow them
to share and allow them to shine.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.456
And so during my sabbatical

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.056
with the organization
that I also work with,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.296
I saw our team rise up in my absence.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.776
They were able to launch new programs,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.216
fundraise.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.936
And when I came back,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.016
I had to give them
a lot of gratitude and praise

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.776
because they showed me
that they truly had my back

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.696
and that they truly had their own backs.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.336
You know, in this process
of my sabbatical,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.616
I was really reminded

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.576
of this Southern African
philosophy of Ubuntu.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.000
I am because you are;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.440
you are because I am.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.536
And I realized that my own leadership,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.096
and the contributions
that I'm able to make,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.376
is in large part due to the contributions
that they make, right?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.016
And I have to acknowledge that,
and I have to see that,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.320
and so my new mantra is,
"Keep calm and trust the team."

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.616
And also,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.056
"Keep calm and thank the team."

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.656
MB: You know, one of the things
I feel like I've heard

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.456
in the context of the Black Lives Matter
movement more than anywhere else

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.696
is about being a leaderful movement,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.456
and that's such a beautiful concept,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.736
and I think that something

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.576
that women often bring
to the conversation about leadership

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.096
is really the collective piece.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.360
What about you, Alicia?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.520
AG: Yeah ...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.080
How many of you heard that saying
that leadership is lonely?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.296
I think that there is an element
where leadership is lonely,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.536
but I also believe
that it doesn't have to be like that.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.016
And in order for us to get to that point,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.776
I think there's a few things
that we need to be doing.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.640
So one is we have to stop
treating leaders like superheroes.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.576
We are ordinary people
attempting to do extraordinary things,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.040
and so we need to be
supported in that way.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.416
The other thing that
I've learned about leadership

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.616
is that there's a difference
between leadership and celebrities, right?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.976
And there's a way in which we've been
kind of transformed into celebrities

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.960
rather than people
who are trying to solve a problem.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.776
And the way that we treat
celebrities is very fickle, right?

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.056
We like them one day,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.336
we don't like what they're
wearing the next day,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.656
and all of a sudden we have issues, right?

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.056
So we need to stop deifying leaders

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.696
so that more people
will step into leadership.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.336
Lots of people are terrified
to step into leadership

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.056
because of how much scrutiny they receive

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.560
and how brutal we are with leaders.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.936
And then the last thing
that I've learned about leadership

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.040
is that it's really easy to be a leader
when everybody likes you.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.360
But it's hard to be a leader
when you have to make hard choices

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.816
and when you have to do what's right,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.736
even though people
are not going to like you for it.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.016
And so in that way,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.376
I think another way
that we can support leaders

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.096
is to struggle with us,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.736
but struggle with us politically,

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.496
not personally.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.416
We can have disagreements
without being disagreeable,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.616
but it's important for us
to sharpen each other,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.256
so that we all can rise.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.839
MB: That's beautiful, thank you.

00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:49.173
(Applause)

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.576
So you all are doing work

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.296
that forces you to face
some brutal, painful realities

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.520
on a daily basis.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.776
What gives you hope

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.080
and inspires you in that context?

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.296
PC: I am hopeful for black futures.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.536
And I say that because
we live in a society

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.216
that's so obsessed with black death.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.816
We have images of our death
on the TV screen,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.736
on our Twitter timelines,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.296
on our Facebook timelines,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.720
but what if instead
we imagine black life?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.696
We imagine black people
living and thriving.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.176
And that --

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.480
that inspires me.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.080
OT: What inspires me
these days are immigrants.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.256
Immigrants all over the world
who are doing the best that they can

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.736
to make a living,
to survive and also to thrive.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.016
Right now there are
over 244 million people

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.320
who aren't living
in their country of origin.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.800
This is a 40 percent increase
since the year 2000.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.096
So what this tells me

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.800
is that the disparities across the globe
are only getting worse.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.616
Yet there are people who are finding
the strength and wherewithal to travel,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.856
to move,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.176
to eke out a better living for themselves

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.880
and to provide for their families
and their loved ones.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.976
And some of these people
who are immigrants

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.976
are also undocumented.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.696
They're unauthorized.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.856
And they inspire me even more

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.616
because although our society
is telling them, you're not wanted,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.016
you're not needed here,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.416
and they're highly vulnerable
and subject to abuse, to wage theft,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.696
to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.896
many of them are also beginning
to organize in their communities.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.096
And what I'm seeing is
that there's also an emerging network

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.416
of black, undocumented people
who are resisting the framework,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.376
and resisting the criminalization
of their existence.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.976
And that to me is incredibly powerful

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and inspires me every singe day.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.520
MB: Thank you.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.880
Alicia?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.136
AG: So we know that young people
are the present and the future,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.576
but what inspires me are older people

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.800
who are becoming transformed
in the service of this movement.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.976
We all know that as you get older,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.176
you get a little more
entrenched in your ways.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.976
It's happening to me, I know that's right.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.776
But I'm so inspired when I see people
who have a way that they do things,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.856
have a way that they
think about the world,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.296
and they're courageous enough to be open
to listening to what the experiences are

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.736
of so many of us who want
to live in world that's just

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.336
and want to live
in a world that's equitable.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.016
And I'm also inspired by the actions
that I'm seeing older people taking

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.576
in service of this movement.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.456
I'm inspired by seeing older people
step into their own power and leadership

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.256
and say, "I'm not passing a torch,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.960
I'm helping you light the fire."

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.456
(Applause)

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.696
MB: I love that --

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.096
yes.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.336
So in terms of action,

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.776
I think that it is awesome to sit here
and be able to listen to you all,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.056
and to have our minds open and shift,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.056
but that's not going to get
black people free.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.536
So if you had one thing
you would like this audience

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.256
and the folks who are watching
around the world to actually do,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.480
what would that be?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.096
AG: OK, two quick ones.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.016
One, call the White House.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.296
The water protectors
are being forcibly removed

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.896
from the camp that they have set up
to defend what keeps us alive.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.776
And that is intricately
related to black lives.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.856
So definitely call the White House
and demand that they stop doing that.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.096
There are tanks

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.200
and police officers arresting
every single person there as we speak.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.856
(Applause)

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.976
The second thing that you can do

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.720
is to join something.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.696
Be a part of something.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.216
There are groups, collectives --

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.816
doesn't have to be a non-profit,
you know what I mean?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.416
But there are groups that are doing
work in our communities right now

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.456
to make sure that black lives matter
so all lives matter.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.696
Get involved;

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.296
don't sit on your couch and tell people
what you think they should be doing.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.520
Go do it with us.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.296
MB: Do you guys want to add anything?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.176
That's good? All right. So --

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.296
And I think that the joining something,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.536
like if you feel like there's
not something where you are, start it.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.776
AG: Start it.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.856
MB: These conversations that we're having,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.976
have those conversations
with somebody else.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.816
And then instead of just
letting it be a talk that you had,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.536
actually decide to start something.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.816
OT: That's right.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.555
MB: I mean, that's what you all did.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.835
You started something,
and look what's happened.

00:15:56.859 --> 00:15:59.776
Thank you all so much
for being here with us today.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.016
OT: Thank you.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.366
(Applause)
