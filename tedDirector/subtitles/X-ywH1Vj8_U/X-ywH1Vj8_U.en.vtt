00:00:12.160 --> 00:05:20.160
(Music)

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:29.160
(Applause)

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
Thank you. Ooh, I'm like, "Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now." (Laughter)

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
people scream out, "What's she doing?!"

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
I'll play at these rock shows, be on stage

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
standing completely still, and they're like,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
"What's she doing?! What's she doing?!"

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And then I'll kind of be like -- (Vvvwow!) -- and then they're like, "Whoa!"

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
(Laughter)

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
I'm sure you're trying to figure out,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
"Well, how does this thing work?"

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Well, what I'm doing is

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
controlling the pitch with my left hand.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.160
See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets --

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
(Portamento) --

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
and you can get it really low.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And with this hand I'm controlling the volume,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
(Tones)

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
So basically, with both of your hands

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
when really it's continuously going ...

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
(Flourish ... Beep)

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
(Laughter)

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Sometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
and I'll lean over to pick up something,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and then it goes like -- (Blip) -- "Oh!"

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
if you don't turn the thing off.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
(Laughter)

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
Maybe we'll go into the next tune,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
because I totally lost where this is going.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.160
We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone,"

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:10:32.160
(Music)

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:42.160
(Applause)

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
that are commonly asked; there are so many.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
a little of the history of the theremin.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.160
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, LÃ©on Theremin

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.160
-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.160
he came up with the idea for making the theremin,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.160
I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like (Screeching) --

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
And so somehow through developing that,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.160
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.160
they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,"

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
(Laughter)

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And sometimes if I have too much coffee,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
then my vibrato gets out of hand.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
You're really sensitive to your body and its functions

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
when you're behind this thing.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.160
with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
you want to be feeling the music.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.160
because little movements with other parts of your body

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) --

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
and breathing will make it ...

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160
(Laughter)

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
If I pass out on the next song ...

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
(Laughter)

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.160
I think of it almost like

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
of every little crazy thing your body is doing,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160
or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.160
while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
"Here, have some drinks on us!"

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
I don't want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?"

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
It really does reflect the mood that you're in also,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
if you're ...

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
it's similar to being a vocalist, except

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
instead of it coming out of your throat,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
you're controlling it just in the air

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
and you don't really have a point of reference;

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
You just have to always adjust to what's happening

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.160
and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:02.160
or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160
I think we will play another tune now.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
I'm going to do "Lush Life." It's one of my favorite tunes to play.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:19:02.160
(Music)

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160
(Applause)
