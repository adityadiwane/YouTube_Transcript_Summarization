00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi there.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm going to be talking a little bit about

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
music, machines and life.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Or, more specifically,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
for a music video.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Some of you may recognize this image.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
We'll be showing the video at the end,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
what it is that they wanted.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
we were really excited because

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And we were very excited about this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
because, of course,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
they have a history of dancing with machines.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
50-million-plus views on YouTube.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Four guys dancing on treadmills,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
no cuts, just a static camera.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
So we were really excited about working with them.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And they explained that they wanted

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Now, for those of you who don't know,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
a Rube Goldberg machine

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is a complicated contraption,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that accomplishes a relatively simple task.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
So we were excited by this idea,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and we started talking about

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
exactly what it would look like.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And we came up with some parameters, because,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
has limitations,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
but it also is pretty wide open.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And we wanted to make sure that we did something

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that would work for a music video.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So we came up with a list of requirements,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the "10 commandments,"

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
The first is "No magic."

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Everything that happened on screen had to be

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
very easily understood by a typical viewer.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
then we couldn't use it in the video.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
They wanted band integration,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that is, the machine acting upon the band members,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
specifically not the other way around.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So as the song picks up emotion,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
so should the machine

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
get grander in its process.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
They wanted us to make use of the space.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
divided between two floors.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
It included an exterior loading dock.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
The machine itself would start the music.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So the machine would get started,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
it would travel some distance,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
reacting along the way,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
hit play on an iPod or a tape deck

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
or something that would start playback.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And speaking of synchronization,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
they wanted it to sync to the rhythm

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and to hit specific beats along the way.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Okay. (Laughter)

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They wanted it to end precisely on time.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And they wanted the music to drop out

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
at a certain point in the video

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and actual live audio from the machine

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to play part of the song.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And as if that wasn't enough,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
all of these incredibly complicating things, right,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
they wanted it in one shot.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
(Laughter)

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.260
(Applause)

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Okay.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
So, just some statistics

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
about what we went through in the process.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
The machine itself has

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
89 distinct interactions.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
It took us 85 takes

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
to get it on film

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to our satisfaction.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Of those 85 takes,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
only three actually successfully completed their run.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
We destroyed two pianos

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
and 10 televisions in the process.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
(Laughter)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And we lost one high-heeled shoe

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and returned back to the build --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and left it in a pile of stuff.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And it's actually in the machine.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
So what did we learn from all of this?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Well, having completed this,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
we have the opportunity to step back and reflect

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
on some of the things.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And we learned that small stuff stinks.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Little balls in wooden tracks

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
are really susceptible to

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and they fall out of the tracks,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
the exact angles makes it hard to get right.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It doesn't matter what temperature it is,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
doesn't matter what's in its way;

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
it will pretty much get where it needs to go.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
so that we would have somewhere to go.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Small stuff stinks,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
but, of course, it's essential, right?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
What else? Planning is incredibly important.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
(Laughter)

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and even building some of these things.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
It's been said that, "No battle plan

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
survives contact with the enemy."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
I think our enemy was physics --

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
(Laughter)

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and she's a cruel mistress.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Often, we had to pull things out as a result

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
These are all things that ended up

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
not making it into the final machine.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
So also, put reliable stuff last,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
the stuff that's going to run every time.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Again, small to large is relevant here.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
references the big, real car

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
near the end of the video.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and that's a problem.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So you put that up front so that, if it fails,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
at least you know

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
you don't have to reset the whole thing.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Life can be

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
messy.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And the wonderful elation that we had

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
when we finally completed it.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
"This Too Shall Pass."

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Thank you very much.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.260
(Applause)

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And now to introduce

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
their music video,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
we have OK Go.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
We are OK Go.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Let me start again.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
Tim's sundial hat.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
Sorry, start again.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Barking)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Dogs.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
[unclear]

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:14.260
(Music)

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260

♫ Let it go ♫

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.260
♫ This too shall pass ♫

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
♫ No, you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.260
♫ Let it go ♫

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.260
♫ This too shall pass ♫

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:24.260
