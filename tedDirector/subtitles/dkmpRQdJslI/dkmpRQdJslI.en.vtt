00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.200
Are you tired of your boss?

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:16.249
(Laughter)

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.114
Are you tired of going to work

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:20.571
and making money for other people?

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:23.361
And who are those people anyways?

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:25.464
Those people that make
money from your work.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:28.096
Well, they're capitalists.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.396
They have capital,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.087
and they use your labor
to make more capital.

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:34.867
So if you're tired of going to work

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.096
and making money for other people,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.788
then you're probably like me --

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:40.579
just tired of capitalism.

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:44.643
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.085
(Laughter)

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.832
I own a small business --

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:50.380
Rco Tires in Compton.

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.367
A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.309
and he wrote, "Let's make
green collar jobs in the hood,"

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.377
I took him really seriously.

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:01.608
So I cofounded, own and operate
a tire recycling company,

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:03.594
and I'm really proud of what we've done.

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:06.991
So far, we've recycled
a hundred million pounds of rubber.

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:11.427
That's 21 million gallons of oil
diverted from landfills

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:12.615
into new products.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.205
(Cheers)

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.878
We also employ about 15 guys --

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:18.017
mostly people of color,

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.411
most of whom are felons,

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:21.310
and we pay above the minimum wage,

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:24.276
and we are now proud members
of the United Steelworkers Union.

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:30.327
(Applause)

00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.890
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:36.581
It's a privately held company
with community-minded ownership,

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:38.359
but I would like it to become one.

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:40.678
I would like for them to fire the boss --

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.041
that's me.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.113
(Laughter)

00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:44.583
And I'm going to tell you why,

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:46.929
but first, let me tell you
how we got started.

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:48.833
So a lot of people ask,

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:50.291
"How did Rco come to be?"

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:51.853
And I have to be really honest.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.244
I leveraged my white privilege.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:58.237
So, here's how white privilege
worked for me and Rco.

00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:03.113
My white grandmother
was born on her family's plantation

00:02:03.137 --> 00:02:05.791
in Arkansas in 1918.

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:08.745
She traveled with her white father west,

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.338
following the oil boom.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:13.542
And he held various union oil jobs --

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.027
jobs which would have never been given
to my black great-grandfather,

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.581
had he lived here at the time.

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:21.491
Granny became a hairdresser

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:25.420
and then got a loan with her husband

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.514
who built their home
in West Los Angeles --

00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:31.016
a loan which would never have been
given to a black family at the time.

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:34.077
And after my grandfather passed away,

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.880
my granny was able to keep that house

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:38.581
because she had his pension
and his health care

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.373
from a state job which he held,

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:43.019
which again, would have never been
given to a black man

00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:45.429
before the anti-discrimination
act of the 1960s.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.726
So, you fast-forward 30 years,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.138
and I graduate,

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:50.864
and I want to start my own business

00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:52.765
with a pile of debt and a credit card,

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.132
and no experience in the tire industry.

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:57.393
But I had what most people didn't have.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:01.896
I had a clean, safe, free place to live.

00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:04.604
I moved in with my grandmother,

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.953
and I was able to rent
our first warehouse,

00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:08.153
buy our first truck,

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:09.737
pay our first employees,

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.175
because I didn't have to worry
about paying myself,

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.982
because I didn't need to feed myself,

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.547
because I am the direct beneficiary
of generations of white privilege.

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:22.587
Now, telling the story
of white privilege is important

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:24.040
because very often people say,

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.922
"Oh, we want more companies like yours.

00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:27.104
We want more Rco's,

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:28.977
we want more black-owned businesses,

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.665
female-led, triple bottom line,

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:32.861
Ban the Box,

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:34.847
green manufacturing companies," right?

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.202
But the question we have to ask is,
where is the wealth?

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:39.377
Where is the money?

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.267
Where's the capital in our communities

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.450
to build the types
of businesses that we want?

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.022
And in telling a story
of the white side of my family,

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:47.197
I needed a dozen ways

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:49.282
where blacks were excluded
from the economy,

00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:52.854
whereas the white side of my family
was able to gain access and traction,

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:54.274
and build wealth ...

00:03:55.044 --> 00:03:59.654
Primarily because racism
and capitalism are best homies, but --

00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:01.480
(Laughter)

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:03.957
but what that means
is that when we ask ourselves,

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.442
"Why are our communities broke?" --

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.672
Like, we're not just broke
because we're broke;

00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:10.031
we're broke for a reason.

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:12.171
Historical context really does matter.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.681
But our history
tells another story as well.

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:18.393
There's this incredible book
called "Collective Courage,"

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:21.633
which is the story of how
thousands of African Americans

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:24.177
have been able to build
businesses and schools,

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.444
hospitals, farming cooperatives,

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:28.185
banks, financial institutions --

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.821
entire communities
and sovereign economies,

00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:32.267
without a lot of capital.

00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:34.774
And they did it by working together

00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:37.205
and leveraging their community assets

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.681
and trusting each other

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:40.405
and putting solidarity first --

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.228
not just profits by any means necessary.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.513
And they didn't have to wait around
for celebrities and athletes

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.823
to bring their money back to the hood.

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:52.002
However, if you are
a celebrity or an athlete,

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.419
and you're listening to this,

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.229
please feel free to bring your money.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.895
(Laughter)

00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.087
But they did it
through cooperative economics,

00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:01.262
because they knew

00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:04.394
that capitalism was never
going to finance black liberation.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.790
So, there are so many great
examples in this book,

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.913
and I suggest that everybody just read it

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:13.180
because it answers
the question I asked earlier,

00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:15.508
which was where are we going
to get the wealth

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.608
to build the types
of business that we want.

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:20.480
And the answer is going to have
to be cooperative economics.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:23.464
There's a lot of different
versions of cooperativism.

00:05:23.488 --> 00:05:25.908
What I'm talking about today
is worker ownership.

00:05:26.504 --> 00:05:28.513
You may not have heard
of worker ownership,

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.147
but it's been an incredible tool

00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:32.252
for black economic liberation
for a century,

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:34.685
and it's also working
all over the world right now.

00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:37.266
You may have heard of Black Wall Street

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.481
or maybe the Zapatistas,

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.551
but I'll give you an example
that's a little bit closer to home.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.092
Right now, today, in South Bronx,

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:47.313
is the country's largest
worker-owned company.

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:50.006
It's called Cooperative
Home Care Associates,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.990
and it was founded by black
and Latinx home care workers

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:56.087
who are now able
to pay themselves living wages,

00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.366
they have full-time hours,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.018
they have benefits and a pension,

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.620
through their membership
as a unit of SEIU.

00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:06.446
And these women owners now receive
a dividend back on their ownership

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.763
every year that the company
has been profitable,

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:10.167
which has been most years.

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.730
So they're able to really enjoy
the fruits of their labor

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:16.412
because they fired the boss.

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.788
They don't have any big investors.

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:20.420
They don't have fat-cat CEOs

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:23.500
or absentee owners taking
the profit out of the company.

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:27.850
They each pay in
about 1,000 dollars over time

00:06:27.874 --> 00:06:29.790
in order to gain ownership,

00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:31.163
and now they own their job.

00:06:32.418 --> 00:06:35.403
Now, there's hundreds of more examples
of companies like this

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.261
springing up all across the country.

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:40.534
And I'm so inspired by what they're doing,

00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:43.043
because it really represents
an alternative

00:06:43.067 --> 00:06:45.098
to the type of economy we have now,

00:06:45.122 --> 00:06:46.484
which exploits all of us.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.790
It also represents an alternative

00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:52.774
to waiting around for big investors
to bring chain stores,

00:06:52.798 --> 00:06:54.570
or big-box stores to our communities,

00:06:54.594 --> 00:06:56.870
because honestly,
those types of developments,

00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:59.218
they steal resources from our communities.

00:06:59.242 --> 00:07:02.079
They put our mom-and-pop shops
out of business,

00:07:02.103 --> 00:07:05.199
they make our entrepreneurs
into wage workers,

00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:07.029
and they take money out of our pocket

00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:08.794
and send it to their shareholders.

00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:13.251
So, I was so inspired by all these stories
of resistance and resilience

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:16.043
that I got together with a few people
here in Los Angeles,

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:17.447
and we created LUCI.

00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:21.990
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles
Union Cooperative Initiative,

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:25.110
and our objective is to create
more worker-owned businesses

00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:26.800
here in Los Angeles.

00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:29.182
So far, in the last year,
we've created two:

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:31.199
Pacific Electric, an electrical company,

00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:32.778
and Vermont Gage Carwash,

00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:34.565
which is right here in South-Central,

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:36.621
some of you guys
might be familiar with it.

00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:41.316
This long-time carwash is now owned
and operated by its 20 workers,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.364
all of whom are union members as well.

00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:48.624
(Applause)

00:07:48.648 --> 00:07:52.546
So you might be wondering
why the focus on union-worker ownership,

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.197
but there's a lot of good reasons

00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:57.971
why the labor movement is a natural ally
to the worker-ownership movement.

00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:00.591
To build these companies
that we want in our community,

00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:01.766
we need a few things.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.388
We're going to need money,
people and training.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.599
Unions have all of those things.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.667
America's working class has been
paying union dues for decades,

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.739
and with it, our unions have been building

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:15.597
dignified, decent,
and democratic workplaces for us.

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.046
However, union jobs
are on the steep decline,

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.476
and it's time for us to start
calling on our unions

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.165
to really bring all of their financial
and political capital

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:27.872
to bear in the creation of new,
union, living-wage jobs

00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:29.109
in our communities.

00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:32.924
Also, union halls
are full of union members

00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:36.091
who understand
the importance of solidarity

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.236
and the power of collective action.

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:43.577
These are the types of folks that want
more union businesses to exist,

00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.811
so let's build them with them.

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:48.330
Learning from our unions,

00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:49.505
learning from our past,

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.702
learning from our peers,

00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:53.370
are all going to be very
important to our success,

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:56.298
which is why I'd like to leave you
with one last example

00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:58.346
and a vision for the future ...

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:01.801
and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.

00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:07.011
Mondragon, Spain is a community
built entirely around worker cooperatives.

00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:10.482
There's 260-plus businesses here,

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:15.283
manufacturing everything from bicycles
to washing machines to transformers.

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:19.382
And this group of businesses
now employs 80,000 people

00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:22.510
and earns more than 12 billion euros
in revenue every year.

00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:27.266
And all of the companies there
are owned by the people that work in them.

00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:32.432
They've also built universities
and hospitals and financial institutions.

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:36.325
I mean, imagine if we could build
something like this in South-Central.

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:40.934
The late mayor of Jackson
had a similar idea.

00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:46.813
He wanted to turn his entire city
into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:49.746
calling his ambitious plan
"Jackson Rising."

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.186
And when I look at Mondragon,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.020
I see really what working-class people
can do for ourselves

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:56.195
when we work together

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:58.775
and make decisions
for ourselves and each other

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.107
and our communities.

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:06.315
And what's really incredible
about Mondragon

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.806
is that while we are dreaming about them,

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.751
they are dreaming about us.

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:16.145
This community in Spain has decided
to launch an international initiative

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:19.171
to create more communities
like it all over the world,

00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:20.802
by linking up with unions,

00:10:20.826 --> 00:10:22.739
by supporting organizations like LUCI,

00:10:22.763 --> 00:10:25.661
and by educating folks
about the worker-ownership model.

00:10:27.177 --> 00:10:29.692
Now, here's what you can do
to be a part of it.

00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:32.296
If you're a union member,
go to your union meetings,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.510
and make sure that your union
has a worker-ownership initiative,

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:36.684
and become a part of it.

00:10:37.177 --> 00:10:38.451
If you're an entrepreneur,

00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:39.895
if you have a small business,

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:41.738
or you're interested in starting one,

00:10:41.762 --> 00:10:44.429
then link up with LUCI
or another organization like us

00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:46.747
to help you get started
on the cooperative model.

00:10:47.078 --> 00:10:48.230
If you're a politician,

00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:49.646
or you work for one,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.337
or you just like talking to them,

00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:55.598
please get the city, state, federal
and county legislation passed

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:59.114
that we need in order to fund
and support worker-owned businesses.

00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:01.040
And for everybody else,

00:11:01.064 --> 00:11:03.303
learn about our history,
learn about our models,

00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:04.953
and seek us out so can support us,

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:08.184
you can buy from us, invest in us,
lend to us and join us,

00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:10.274
because it's really
going to take all of us

00:11:10.298 --> 00:11:13.918
in order to build the more just
and sustainable and resilient economy

00:11:13.942 --> 00:11:16.873
that we want for ourselves
and our children.

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:18.908
And with that,

00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:22.123
I would like to leave you
with a quote from Arundhati Roy,

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:23.297
and she writes ...

00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:28.518
"Our strategy should not be only
to confront Empire,

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:30.160
but to lay siege to it.

00:11:31.016 --> 00:11:32.611
To deprive it of oxygen.

00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:34.915
To mock it.

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:36.089
To shame it.

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:37.916
With our art,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.114
our literature,

00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:40.402
our music,

00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:41.576
our brilliance,

00:11:42.131 --> 00:11:43.281
our joy,

00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:45.719
our sheer relentlessness --

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.528
and our ability to tell our own stories.

00:11:49.026 --> 00:11:51.756
Not the stories that we're being
brainwashed to believe.

00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:55.618
The corporate revolution will collapse

00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:57.872
if we refuse to buy
what they're selling --

00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:00.206
their ideas,

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:02.147
their version of history,

00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.322
their wars,

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:04.515
their weapons,

00:12:05.144 --> 00:12:06.578
their sense of inevitability.

00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:08.926
Because know this:

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:11.502
They be few and we be many.

00:12:12.053 --> 00:12:13.939
They need us more than we need them.

00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:17.122
Another world is not only possible,

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:18.692
she's on her way.

00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:20.669
And on a quiet day,

00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:22.613
I can hear her breathing."

00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:24.299
Thank you.

00:12:24.323 --> 00:12:26.224
(Applause)
