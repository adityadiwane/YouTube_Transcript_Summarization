00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:19.096
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:22.496
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:26.734
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:30.528
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:34.377
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:38.178
which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:42.298
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:45.433
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:48.138
education is just not readily accessible.

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:51.113
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.986
in the days of apartheid for the white minority.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.686
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots

00:00:56.686 --> 00:01:00.538
for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:04.418
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.254
at the University of Johannesburg.

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.385
There were a handful of positions left open

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.354
from the standard admissions process, and the night before

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.914
they were supposed to open that for registration,

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:17.966
thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.846
hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.154
When the gates opened, there was a stampede,

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:27.806
and 20 people were injured and one woman died.

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:29.746
She was a mother who gave her life

00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:33.809
trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:36.966
But even in parts of the world like the United States

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:41.322
where education is available, it might not be within reach.

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:43.994
There has been much discussed in the last few years

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:45.983
about the rising cost of health care.

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:48.625
What might not be quite as obvious to people

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:52.647
is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition

00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:55.127
has been increasing at almost twice the rate,

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:59.407
for a total of 559 percent since 1985.

00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:03.941
This makes education unaffordable for many people.

00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.742
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:10.367
the doors of opportunity might not open.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.574
Only a little over half of recent college graduates

00:02:13.574 --> 00:02:15.887
in the United States who get a higher education

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:19.350
actually are working in jobs that require that education.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.190
This, of course, is not true for the students

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.142
who graduate from the top institutions,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.774
but for many others, they do not get the value

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:29.310
for their time and their effort.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.340
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.708
captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.828
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:43.727
when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.348
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:48.860
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.979
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.547
three big Stanford classes,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:57.427
each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.811
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,

00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:02.731
the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.460
and cofounder Andrew Ng.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.779
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:07.988
It's a Machine Learning class,

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:11.506
and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:14.771
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,

00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.387
it had 100,000 people registered.

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.396
So to put that number in perspective,

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:21.755
for Andrew to reach that same size audience

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.581
by teaching a Stanford class,

00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:27.507
he would have to do that for 250 years.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.993
Of course, he'd get really bored.

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.730
So, having seen the impact of this,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.858
Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,

00:03:36.858 --> 00:03:40.978
to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.

00:03:40.978 --> 00:03:42.473
So we formed Coursera,

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:45.610
whose goal is to take the best courses

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.927
from the best instructors at the best universities

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.955
and provide it to everyone around the world for free.

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:55.555
We currently have 43 courses on the platform

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.754
from four universities across a range of disciplines,

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:00.587
and let me show you a little bit of an overview

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.865
of what that looks like.

00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:05.078
(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.958
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.229
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.637
We get unbelievable segregation.

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.429
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.807
you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:21.061
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.726
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:27.797
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:30.774
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.

00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:34.397
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.

00:04:34.397 --> 00:04:38.013
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.

00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:41.700
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.309
(Applause)

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.583
DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:51.821
that students like getting the best content

00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.708
from the best universities for free.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:57.230
Since we opened the website in February,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.588
we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.

00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:03.740
We have 1.5 million enrollments,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.590
6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.506
so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:14.024
But it's not just about the numbers,

00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:15.665
it's also about the people.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.641
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India

00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.816
and would never have access in this case

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:22.305
to a Stanford-quality course

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.820
and would never be able to afford it.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.858
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two

00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:28.825
and wants to hone her skills

00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:31.960
so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.096
Or Ryan, who can't go to school,

00:05:35.096 --> 00:05:36.961
because his immune deficient daughter

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:40.344
can't be risked to have germs come into the house,

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:42.184
so he couldn't leave the house.

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:43.816
I'm really glad to say --

00:05:43.816 --> 00:05:46.068
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --

00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:48.000
that this story had a happy ending.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.903
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:51.254
is doing much better now,

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:55.452
and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.

00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:57.696
So what made these courses so different?

00:05:57.696 --> 00:06:01.416
After all, online course content has been available for a while.

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:05.128
What made it different was that this was real course experience.

00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:06.854
It started on a given day,

00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:10.488
and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis

00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:12.343
and do homework assignments.

00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:14.134
And these would be real homework assignments

00:06:14.134 --> 00:06:17.438
for a real grade, with a real deadline.

00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.494
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.

00:06:19.494 --> 00:06:21.582
These are the spikes showing

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:25.371
that procrastination is global phenomenon.

00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.947
(Laughter)

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.619
At the end of the course,

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.475
the students got a certificate.

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.635
They could present that certificate

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:35.788
to a prospective employer and get a better job,

00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:37.848
and we know many students who did.

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:39.767
Some students took their certificate

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:42.889
and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.730
for actual college credit.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.944
So these students were really getting something meaningful

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:49.778
for their investment of time and effort.

00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:52.333
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:54.225
that go into these courses.

00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.853
The first component is that when you move away

00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:59.150
from the constraints of a physical classroom

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.990
and design content explicitly for an online format,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.518
you can break away from, for example,

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:06.933
the monolithic one-hour lecture.

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:08.718
You can break up the material, for example,

00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:12.094
into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,

00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:15.068
each of which represents a coherent concept.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.638
Students can traverse this material in different ways,

00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:21.342
depending on their background, their skills or their interests.

00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:23.862
So, for example, some students might benefit

00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:26.622
from a little bit of preparatory material

00:07:26.622 --> 00:07:28.693
that other students might already have.

00:07:28.693 --> 00:07:31.133
Other students might be interested in a particular

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:34.219
enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.454
So this format allows us to break away

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:40.278
from the one-size-fits-all model of education,

00:07:40.278 --> 00:07:44.270
and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.613
Of course, we all know as educators

00:07:46.613 --> 00:07:49.973
that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:52.918
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort

00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.510
is that we need to have students

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.919
who practice with the material

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:01.075
in order to really understand it.

00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:04.343
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.

00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:06.875
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:09.707
demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,

00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:12.499
where students are just supposed to repeat

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:13.899
what they already learned

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.819
gives considerably improved results

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:18.088
on various achievement tests down the line

00:08:18.088 --> 00:08:22.392
than many other educational interventions.

00:08:22.392 --> 00:08:25.354
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:27.608
as well as other forms of practice in many ways.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:31.752
For example, even our videos are not just videos.

00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:33.795
Every few minutes, the video pauses

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:35.946
and the students get asked a question.

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:38.167
(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:41.259
status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:44.026
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.

00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:45.650
DK: So here the video pauses,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.906
and the student types in the answer into the box

00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:51.129
and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.

00:08:51.144 --> 00:08:52.013
(Laughter)

00:08:52.013 --> 00:08:54.023
So they get to try again,

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.559
and this time they got it right.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.752
There's an optional explanation if they want.

00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:03.009
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.887
This is a kind of simple question

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:06.968
that I as an instructor might ask in class,

00:09:06.968 --> 00:09:09.468
but when I ask that kind of a question in class,

00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:10.768
80 percent of the students

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.634
are still scribbling the last thing I said,

00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:15.955
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:18.411
and then there's the smarty pants in the front row

00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:19.770
who blurts out the answer

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.977
before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.849
and I as the instructor am terribly gratified

00:09:24.849 --> 00:09:26.497
that somebody actually knew the answer.

00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:29.289
And so the lecture moves on before, really,

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:32.818
most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.

00:09:32.818 --> 00:09:35.425
Here, every single student

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:38.209
has to engage with the material.

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:40.145
And of course these simple retrieval questions

00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:41.807
are not the end of the story.

00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:44.777
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:47.130
and one also needs to provide the students with feedback

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.793
on those questions.

00:09:48.793 --> 00:09:51.681
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:54.763
if you do not have 10,000 TAs?

00:09:54.763 --> 00:09:57.117
The answer is, you need to use technology

00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:58.612
to do it for you.

00:09:58.612 --> 00:10:01.260
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.528
and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.

00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:06.055
In addition to multiple choice

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:09.208
and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:12.468
we can also grade math, mathematical expressions

00:10:12.468 --> 00:10:14.420
as well as mathematical derivations.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.294
We can grade models, whether it's

00:10:17.294 --> 00:10:19.470
financial models in a business class

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.454
or physical models in a science or engineering class

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:26.198
and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:28.117
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.597
but fairly visual.

00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:32.074
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,

00:10:32.074 --> 00:10:33.678
and the students are supposed to color-correct

00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:35.270
that blurry red image.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.288
They're typing their program into the browser,

00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:41.346
and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.

00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:45.102
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,

00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:47.461
and they can move on to the next assignment.

00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.609
This ability to interact actively with the material

00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.293
and be told when you're right or wrong

00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:55.419
is really essential to student learning.

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:57.694
Now, of course we cannot yet grade

00:10:57.694 --> 00:11:00.528
the range of work that one needs for all courses.

00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:03.829
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.751
that is so essential in such disciplines

00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:09.348
as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.

00:11:09.348 --> 00:11:11.597
So we tried to convince, for example,

00:11:11.597 --> 00:11:13.213
some of our humanities faculty

00:11:13.213 --> 00:11:15.909
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:18.100
That didn't go over really well.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.533
So we had to come up with a different solution.

00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:23.607
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.

00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:26.029
It turns out that previous studies show,

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:27.701
like this one by Saddler and Good,

00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:30.189
that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.403
for providing reproducible grades.

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:35.173
It was tried only in small classes,

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:36.660
but there it showed, for example,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.142
that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis

00:11:39.142 --> 00:11:40.453
are actually very well correlated

00:11:40.453 --> 00:11:42.749
with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:45.909
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,

00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:48.220
where the students grade their own work critically --

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.957
so long as you incentivize them properly

00:11:49.957 --> 00:11:51.895
so they can't give themselves a perfect score --

00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:55.086
are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.

00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:56.693
And so this is an effective strategy

00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:58.797
that can be used for grading at scale,

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:01.533
and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,

00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:03.788
because they actually learn from the experience.

00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:08.437
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,

00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.941
where tens of thousands of students

00:12:10.941 --> 00:12:12.139
are grading each other's work,

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:15.208
and quite successfully, I have to say.

00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.468
But this is not just about students

00:12:17.468 --> 00:12:20.509
sitting alone in their living room working through problems.

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:22.316
Around each one of our courses,

00:12:22.316 --> 00:12:24.476
a community of students had formed,

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:26.356
a global community of people

00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:28.888
around a shared intellectual endeavor.

00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:31.540
What you see here is a self-generated map

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.501
from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,

00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:37.260
where they have put themselves on a world map,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.220
and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.787
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.

00:12:44.787 --> 00:12:47.426
First of all, there was a question and answer forum,

00:12:47.426 --> 00:12:49.570
where students would pose questions,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.994
and other students would answer those questions.

00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:53.707
And the really amazing thing is,

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.377
because there were so many students,

00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:57.742
it means that even if a student posed a question

00:12:57.742 --> 00:12:59.374
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:12:59.374 --> 00:13:00.956
somewhere around the world,

00:13:00.956 --> 00:13:03.030
there would be somebody who was awake

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.343
and working on the same problem.

00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:07.301
And so, in many of our courses,

00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.630
the median response time for a question

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.048
on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.

00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:17.625
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.966
(Laughter)

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.908
And you can see from the student testimonials

00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:22.595
that students actually find

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:25.116
that because of this large online community,

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:27.715
they got to interact with each other in many ways

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:31.908
that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.

00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:34.252
Students also self-assembled,

00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:36.115
without any kind of intervention from us,

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.018
into small study groups.

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:40.380
Some of these were physical study groups

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.206
along geographical constraints

00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:44.928
and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.

00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:46.828
This is the San Francisco study group,

00:13:46.828 --> 00:13:49.147
but there were ones all over the world.

00:13:49.147 --> 00:13:51.179
Others were virtual study groups,

00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:54.168
sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.612
and on the bottom left there,

00:13:55.612 --> 00:13:59.408
you see our multicultural universal study group

00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:01.171
where people explicitly wanted to connect

00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:04.177
with people from other cultures.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.288
There are some tremendous opportunities

00:14:06.288 --> 00:14:09.613
to be had from this kind of framework.

00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:13.267
The first is that it has the potential of giving us

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:15.701
a completely unprecedented look

00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.990
into understanding human learning.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.453
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.

00:14:21.453 --> 00:14:25.462
You can collect every click, every homework submission,

00:14:25.462 --> 00:14:29.825
every forum post from tens of thousands of students.

00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:32.168
So you can turn the study of human learning

00:14:32.168 --> 00:14:34.101
from the hypothesis-driven mode

00:14:34.101 --> 00:14:36.959
to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.000
for example, has revolutionized biology.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.424
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.304
like, what are good learning strategies

00:14:45.304 --> 00:14:48.000
that are effective versus ones that are not?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.240
And in the context of particular courses,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.777
you can ask questions

00:14:51.777 --> 00:14:55.032
like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common

00:14:55.032 --> 00:14:57.209
and how do we help students fix them?

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.633
So here's an example of that,

00:14:58.633 --> 00:15:00.649
also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.857
This is a distribution of wrong answers

00:15:02.857 --> 00:15:04.467
to one of Andrew's assignments.

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:06.360
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.631
so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.

00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:12.409
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:14.815
The big cross at the top left

00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:16.963
is where 2,000 students

00:15:16.963 --> 00:15:20.008
gave the exact same wrong answer.

00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:22.335
Now, if two students in a class of 100

00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:23.622
give the same wrong answer,

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.973
you would never notice.

00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:27.533
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.230
it's kind of hard to miss.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.422
So Andrew and his students went in,

00:15:31.422 --> 00:15:32.942
looked at some of those assignments,

00:15:32.942 --> 00:15:37.030
understood the root cause of the misconception,

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.550
and then they produced a targeted error message

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.799
that would be provided to every student

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:43.978
whose answer fell into that bucket,

00:15:43.978 --> 00:15:46.062
which means that students who made that same mistake

00:15:46.062 --> 00:15:48.088
would now get personalized feedback

00:15:48.088 --> 00:15:52.487
telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

00:15:52.487 --> 00:15:56.298
So this personalization is something that one can then build

00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:59.438
by having the virtue of large numbers.

00:15:59.438 --> 00:16:01.750
Personalization is perhaps

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.173
one of the biggest opportunities here as well,

00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:06.518
because it provides us with the potential

00:16:06.518 --> 00:16:09.208
of solving a 30-year-old problem.

00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:12.557
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,

00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:14.808
posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.870
which he observed by studying three populations.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.478
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.

00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:24.255
The second is a population of students that studied

00:16:24.255 --> 00:16:25.974
using a standard lecture-based classroom,

00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:28.054
but with a mastery-based approach,

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.974
so the students couldn't move on to the next topic

00:16:29.974 --> 00:16:33.328
before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.

00:16:33.328 --> 00:16:35.622
And finally, there was a population of students

00:16:35.622 --> 00:16:40.150
that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.422
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,

00:16:43.422 --> 00:16:45.710
or sigma, in achievement scores better

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.104
than the standard lecture-based class,

00:16:48.104 --> 00:16:50.248
and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma

00:16:50.248 --> 00:16:52.078
improvement in performance.

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:53.541
To understand what that means,

00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:55.374
let's look at the lecture-based classroom,

00:16:55.374 --> 00:16:58.293
and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.

00:16:58.293 --> 00:16:59.631
So in a lecture-based class,

00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:03.510
half the students are above that level and half are below.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.608
In the individual tutoring instruction,

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:10.409
98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.

00:17:10.409 --> 00:17:14.329
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.527
would be above average.

00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:19.950
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.349
Because we cannot afford, as a society,

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.421
to provide every student with an individual human tutor.

00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:27.670
But maybe we can afford to provide each student

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.689
with a computer or a smartphone.

00:17:29.689 --> 00:17:31.878
So the question is, how can we use technology

00:17:31.878 --> 00:17:35.253
to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,

00:17:35.253 --> 00:17:37.991
to the right side with the green curve?

00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:40.328
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,

00:17:40.328 --> 00:17:41.733
because a computer doesn't get tired

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:44.806
of showing you the same video five times.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:48.057
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,

00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:51.088
we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.

00:17:51.088 --> 00:17:52.942
And even personalization

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:55.078
is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,

00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:58.270
whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.534
or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.

00:18:01.534 --> 00:18:04.022
So the goal here is to try and push,

00:18:04.022 --> 00:18:07.519
and see how far we can get towards the green curve.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:12.878
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?

00:18:12.878 --> 00:18:15.870
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.415
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes

00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:20.118
go straight to the students' lecture notes,

00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:22.494
without passing through the brains of either."

00:18:22.494 --> 00:18:26.541
(Laughter)

00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:29.209
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:31.874
I think what he was complaining about is not

00:18:31.874 --> 00:18:34.624
universities but rather the lecture-based format

00:18:34.624 --> 00:18:37.408
that so many universities spend so much time on.

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.567
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch,

00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:42.794
who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,

00:18:42.794 --> 00:18:44.817
but wood that needs igniting."

00:18:44.817 --> 00:18:47.007
And maybe we should spend less time at universities

00:18:47.007 --> 00:18:49.578
filling our students' minds with content

00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:53.378
by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,

00:18:53.378 --> 00:18:56.633
their imagination and their problem-solving skills

00:18:56.633 --> 00:18:59.131
by actually talking with them.

00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.498
So how do we do that?

00:19:00.498 --> 00:19:03.929
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.

00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:06.378
So there's been many studies, including this one,

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.458
that show that if you use active learning,

00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:10.874
interacting with your students in the classroom,

00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:13.570
performance improves on every single metric --

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.019
on attendance, on engagement and on learning

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:18.074
as measured by a standardized test.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.938
You can see, for example, that the achievement score

00:19:19.938 --> 00:19:22.808
almost doubles in this particular experiment.

00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:27.209
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.

00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:31.786
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education

00:19:31.786 --> 00:19:33.689
to everyone around the world for free,

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:36.510
what would that do? Three things.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.931
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,

00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.297
where anyone around the world

00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:43.218
with the ability and the motivation

00:19:43.218 --> 00:19:45.169
could get the skills that they need

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.754
to make a better life for themselves,

00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:48.771
their families and their communities.

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.402
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.

00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:53.353
It's a shame that for so many people,

00:19:53.353 --> 00:19:56.665
learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.

00:19:56.665 --> 00:19:59.146
By having this amazing content be available,

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:01.889
we would be able to learn something new

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:03.025
every time we wanted,

00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:04.354
whether it's just to expand our minds

00:20:04.354 --> 00:20:06.313
or it's to change our lives.

00:20:06.313 --> 00:20:09.458
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:12.530
because amazing talent can be found anywhere.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.538
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs

00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:18.153
is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.

00:20:18.153 --> 00:20:20.809
And if we could offer that person an education,

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:23.165
they would be able to come up with the next big idea

00:20:23.165 --> 00:20:25.569
and make the world a better place for all of us.

00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:26.729
Thank you very much.

00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:34.312
(Applause)
