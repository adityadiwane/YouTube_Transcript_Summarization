00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
towards a renaissance in Africa.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The question of transformation in Africa

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
really is a question of leadership.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And it is my contention that the manner in which

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we educate our leaders is fundamental

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to progress on this continent.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
about the state of leadership in Africa

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that had taken me over a decade to reach.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Twice she was involved in surgeries

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where they lost power at the hospital.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The emergency generators did not start.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
pitch black.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The patient's cut open, twice.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The first time it was a C-section.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And it happened twice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And so three months later,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
just before she returned to the United States,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
nurses in Accra go on strike.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And her recommendation is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Start all over again.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now what does this have to do with leadership?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You see, the folks at the ministry of health,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
they are among just five percent of their peers

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
who get an education after secondary school.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
They are the elite. They are our leaders.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Their decisions, their actions matter.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So when I speak of leadership,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm not talking about just political leaders.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We've heard a lot about that.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm talking about the elite.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Those who've been trained,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the engineers, the civil servants --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
those are the leaders.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And we need to train them right.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
occurred when I was 16 years old.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We had just had a military coup,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and soldiers were pervasive in our society.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They were a pervasive presence.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to the terminal building,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And they asked me to join a crowd of people

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that were running up and down this embankment.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
No sign to this effect.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now, I was 16. I was very worried about

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
what my peers at school might think

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
if they saw me running up and down this hill.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And so I started to argue with these men.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I got lucky.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and they explain to him that they're just following orders.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and gets us all released.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
What lessons would you take from an experience like this?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Several, for me.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Leadership matters. Those men are following

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the orders of a superior officer.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I learned something about courage.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It was important not to look at those guns.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to go to Swarthmore College for my education.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It was a breath of fresh air.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
They wanted us to think critically.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
They wanted us to be analytical.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
In my economics classes I got high marks

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
for my understanding of basic economics.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But I learned something more profound than that,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
were making breathtakingly bad decisions

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It matters a great deal.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I had an inkling,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
whose job it was to design and implement new software

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that created value in the world.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It was brilliant.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
this transformation --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the ability to confront problems, complex problems,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and to design solutions to those problems.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The ability to create is the most empowering thing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that can happen to an individual.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And I was part of that.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And by the way, it's continued to.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The gap has widened since I left.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
persistent, creative, empowered.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But there were also some external factors:

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
These things were provided by institutions

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
run by the people that I call leaders.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I became a parent.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Because I realized that the state of the African continent

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
would matter to my children and their children.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That the state of the world -- the state of the world

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
depends on what's happening to Africa,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
as far as my kids would be concerned.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And at this time, when I was going through

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Africa was a mess.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and I needed to be back helping.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and really try to understand what the real issues were.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And three things kept coming up for every problem:

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
corruption, weak institutions

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and the people who run them -- the leaders.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Now, I was a little scared

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
because when you see those three problems,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
they seem really hard to deal with.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And they might say, "Look, don't even try."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But, for me, I asked the question,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
"Well, where are these leaders coming from?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And it was the same -- learning by rote --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
from primary school through graduate school.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Very little emphasis on ethics,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and the typical graduate

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is wrong.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So I decided to engage this particular problem.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Because it seems to me that every society, every society,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And Ghana was not paying enough attention.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So this is what I'm doing now.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I think it would make a huge difference.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And what Ashesi University is trying to do

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
who have the ability to confront the complex problems,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,"

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
but we must believe that these kids are smart.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That if we involve them in their education,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
that our whole society confronts --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that magic will happen.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And a month into it, I come to the office,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and I have this email from one of our students.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And he signs off, "Thank you."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
It's such a simple statement.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But I was moved almost to tears

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
because I understood what was happening to this young man.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And it is an awesome thing to be a part

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of empowering someone in this way.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I am thinking now.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
This year we challenged our students

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to craft an honor code themselves.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
over whether they should have an honor code,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and if so, what it should look like.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Can we create a perfect society?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Now, we cannot achieve perfection,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I don't know ultimately what they will do.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
But the conversation they're having now --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
about what their good society should look like,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
what their excellent society should look like,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is a really good thing.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Am I out of time? OK.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
because it's important that we think about it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I'm very excited about the fact

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
These young future leaders are beginning to understand

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the real business of leadership,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
the real privilege of leadership,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
which is after all to serve humanity.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
our student body elected a woman

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
to be the head of Student Government.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's the first time in the history of Ghana

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that a woman has been elected head of Student Government

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
at any university.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It says a lot about her.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It says a lot about her peers who elected her.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
She won with 75 percent of the vote.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And it gives me a lot of hope.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
It turns out that corporate West Africa

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
also appreciates what's happening with our students.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We've graduated two classes of students to date.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And every single one of them has been placed.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And we're getting great reports back

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
You know, that passion for what they're doing.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
This is good because

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
over the past five years, there have been times

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I think that the current and future leaders of Africa

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
have an incredible opportunity

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
to drive a major renaissance on the continent.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It's an incredible opportunity.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
We have reached a moment from which can emerge

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
a great society within one generation.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It will depend on inspired leadership.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
will make all the difference.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thank you, and God bless.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
(Applause)
