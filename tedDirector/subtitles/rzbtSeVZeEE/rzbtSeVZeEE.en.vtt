00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:16.579
I want you all to think

00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:22.295
about the third word
that was ever said about you --

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:26.614
or, if you were delivering,

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:30.344
about the person you were delivering.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.705
And you can all mouth it
if you want or say it out loud.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:41.286
It was -- the first two were, "It's a ..."

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.331
Audience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:44.356
(Laughter)

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.982
Well, it shows you that --

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.085
I also deal with issues
where there's not certainty

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.684
of whether it's a girl or a boy,

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.989
so the mixed answer was very appropriate.

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:58.970
Of course, now the answer often comes
not at birth but at the ultrasound,

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:02.948
unless the prospective parents
choose to be surprised,

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:04.576
like we all were.

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:12.835
But I want you to think about what it is
that leads to that statement

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.875
on the third word,

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.376
because the third word

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.238
is a description of your sex.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.548
And by that I mean,

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:31.071
made by a description of your genitals.

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.480
Now, as a pediatric endocrinologist,

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:40.981
I used to be very, very involved
and still somewhat am, in cases

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:47.269
in which there are mismatches
in the externals

00:01:47.293 --> 00:01:51.307
or between the externals
and the internals,

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:56.144
and we literally have to figure out

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.286
what is the description of your sex.

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:05.784
But there is nothing
that is definable at the time of birth

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:09.053
that would define you.

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.244
And when I talk about definition,

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:17.029
I'm talking about your sexual orientation.

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:22.143
We don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!"

00:02:23.668 --> 00:02:24.957
"A lesbian girl!"

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.958
Those situations don't
really define themselves

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.171
more until the second decade of life.

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:38.928
Nor do they define your gender,

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:42.540
which, as different
from your anatomic sex,

00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:45.814
describes your self-concept:

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:51.346
Do you see yourself as a male or female,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.326
or somewhere in the spectrum in between?

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:01.872
That sometimes shows up

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.856
in the first decade of life,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.502
but it can be very confusing for parents,

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:13.233
because it is quite normative for children

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:17.610
to act in a cross-gender play and way,

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:19.944
and, in fact, there are studies that show

00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:25.796
that even 80 percent of children
who act in that fashion

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.738
will not persist in wanting
to be the opposite gender

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:35.458
at the time when puberty begins.

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:41.278
But, at the time that puberty begins --

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:47.835
that means between about age 10 to 12
in girls, 12 to 14 in boys --

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.946
with breast budding,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.843
or two to three times'
increase in the gonads

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.712
in the case of genetic males,

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.362
by that particular point,

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:04.318
the child who says
they are in the absolute wrong body

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:08.034
is almost certain to be transgender

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:16.279
and is extremely unlikely
to change those feelings,

00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:20.838
no matter how anybody tries
reparative therapy

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:23.036
or any other noxious things.

00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:27.189
Now, this is relatively rare,

00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:30.109
so I had relatively little
personal experience with this.

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:33.583
And my experience was more typical,

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.647
only because I had an adolescent practice.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.339
And I saw someone age 24,

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:41.930
genetically female, went through Harvard
with three male roommates

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:43.290
who knew the whole story,

00:04:43.314 --> 00:04:49.331
a registrar who always listed his name
on course lists as a male name,

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.306
and came to me after graduating,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.324
saying, "Help me. I know you know
a lot of endocrinology."

00:04:56.348 --> 00:04:59.656
And indeed, I've treated a lot of people
who were born without gonads.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.324
This wasn't rocket science.

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:02.951
But I made a deal with him:

00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:04.772
"I'll treat you if you teach me."

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.987
And so he did.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:10.971
And what an education I got

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:13.824
from taking care of all the members
of his support group.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:18.170
And then I got really confused,

00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:20.727
because I thought it was
relatively easy at that age

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.334
to just give people the hormones

00:05:22.358 --> 00:05:25.776
of the gender
in which they were affirming.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:29.801
But then my patient married,

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:34.631
and he married a woman
who had been born as a male,

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:37.934
had married as a male, had two children,

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.229
then went through
a transition into female.

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.710
And now this delightful female

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:54.202
was attached to my male patient --
in fact, got legally married,

00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:57.478
because they showed up as a man
and a woman, and who knew, right?

00:05:57.502 --> 00:05:59.005
(Laughter)

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:03.003
And I was confused --

00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:05.898
"Does this make so-and-so gay?

00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:07.672
Does this make so-and-so straight?"

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:12.522
I was getting sexual orientation
confused with gender identity.

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:15.784
And my patient said to me,

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.276
"Look, look, look.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.713
If you just think of the following,
you'll get it right:

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:23.980
Sexual orientation
is who you go to bed with.

00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:27.344
Gender identity is who you go to bed as."

00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:29.803
(Laughter)

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:32.619
And I subsequently learned
from the many adults --

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:35.165
I took care of about 200 adults --

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:36.859
I learned from them

00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:41.518
that if I didn't peek as to who
their partner was in the waiting room,

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:45.217
I would never be able to guess
better than chance,

00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:49.439
whether they were gay,
straight, bi or asexual

00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:51.607
in their affirmed gender.

00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:52.853
In other words,

00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:57.436
one thing has absolutely nothing
to do with the other.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.139
And the data show it.

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:04.224
Now, as I took care of the 200 adults,

00:07:04.248 --> 00:07:05.843
I found it extremely painful.

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:09.797
These people -- many of them --

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:14.098
had to give up so much of their lives.

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.553
Sometimes their parents would reject them,

00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:18.926
siblings, their own children,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.697
and then their divorcing spouse

00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:24.232
would forbid them
from seeing their children.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.485
It was so awful,

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.765
but why did they do it at 40 and 50?

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:35.034
Because they felt
they had to affirm themselves

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:36.840
before they would kill themselves.

00:07:37.316 --> 00:07:43.262
And indeed, the rate of suicide
among untreated transgendered people

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:45.737
is among the highest in the world.

00:07:47.057 --> 00:07:48.210
So, what to do?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.932
I was intrigued, in going
to a conference in Holland,

00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:55.202
where they are experts in this,

00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.528
and saw the most remarkable thing.

00:07:58.623 --> 00:08:01.845
They were treating young adolescents

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:07.839
after giving them the most intense
psychometric testing of gender,

00:08:07.863 --> 00:08:12.259
and they were treating them by blocking
the puberty that they didn't want.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.845
Because basically,
kids look about the same,

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:17.864
each sex, until they go through puberty,

00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:20.581
at which point, if you feel
you're in the wrong sex,

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:22.794
you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:26.216
The fantasy that you had
that your body will change

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.891
to be who you want it to be, with puberty,

00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:31.636
actually is nullified
by the puberty you get.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.796
And they fall apart.

00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:40.804
So that's why putting the puberty
on hold -- why on hold?

00:08:40.828 --> 00:08:43.878
You can't just give them
the opposite hormones that young.

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:45.737
They'll end up stunted in growth,

00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.309
and you think you can have
a meaningful conversation

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:50.823
about the fertility effects
of such treatment

00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:54.242
with a 10-year-old girl,
a 12-year-old boy?

00:08:54.663 --> 00:08:57.169
So this buys time
in the diagnostic process

00:08:57.193 --> 00:08:59.021
for four or five years,

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:01.343
so that they can work it out.

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:04.447
They can have more and more testing,

00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.440
they can live without feeling their bodies
are running away from them.

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:12.622
And then, in a program they call 12-16-18,

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:17.495
around age 12 is when they
give the blocking hormones,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.959
and then at age 16, with retesting,

00:09:19.983 --> 00:09:22.265
they re-qualify to receive --

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:25.261
now remember, the blocking
hormones are reversible,

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:28.166
but when you give the hormones
of the opposite sex,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.507
you now start spouting breasts
and facial hair and voice change,

00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:33.273
depending on what you're using,

00:09:33.297 --> 00:09:35.399
and those effects are permanent,

00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:37.241
or require surgery to remove,

00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:38.496
or electrolysis,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.646
and you can never really affect the voice.

00:09:41.027 --> 00:09:44.280
So this is serious,
and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:47.861
And then at 18,
they're eligible for surgery.

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:52.864
And while there's no good surgery
for females to males genitally,

00:09:52.888 --> 00:09:56.188
the male-to-female surgery
has fooled gynecologists.

00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:58.833
That's how good it can be.

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:04.064
So I looked at how
the patients were doing,

00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:06.950
and I looked at patients
who just looked like everybody else,

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.705
except they were pubertally delayed.

00:10:09.729 --> 00:10:11.642
But once they gave them the hormones

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:14.275
consistent with the gender they affirm,

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:15.532
they look beautiful.

00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:17.515
They look normal.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.395
They had normal heights.

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:22.737
You would never be able
to pick them out in a crowd.

00:10:24.522 --> 00:10:27.079
So at that point, I decided
I'm going to do this.

00:10:27.103 --> 00:10:31.587
This is really where the pediatric
endocrine realm comes in,

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:36.428
because, in fact, if you're going to deal
with it in kids aged 10 to 14,

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:38.372
that's pediatric endocrinology.

00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:42.741
So I brought some kids in,

00:10:43.513 --> 00:10:46.074
and this now became the standard of care,

00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:48.903
and the [Boston]
Children's Hospital was behind it.

00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:53.070
By my showing them
the kids before and after,

00:10:53.094 --> 00:10:56.915
people who never got treated
and people who wished to be treated,

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.527
and pictures of the Dutch --

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.256
they came to me and said,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.487
"You've got to do
something for these kids."

00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:05.568
Well, where were these kids before?

00:11:06.774 --> 00:11:09.145
They were out there suffering,
is where they were.

00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:16.038
So we started a program in 2007.

00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:18.458
It became the first program of its kind --

00:11:18.482 --> 00:11:20.839
but it's really of the Dutch kind --

00:11:20.863 --> 00:11:22.046
in North America.

00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:26.426
And since then, we have 160 patients.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.831
Did they come from Afghanistan? No.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:37.440
75 percent of them came
from within 150 miles of Boston.

00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.456
And some came from England.

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:46.181
Jackie had been abused
in the Midlands, in England.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.067
She's 12 years old there,

00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:49.404
she was living as a girl,

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:51.586
but she was being beaten up.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.181
It was a horror show,
they had to homeschool her.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:56.993
And the reason the British were coming

00:11:57.017 --> 00:12:02.717
was because they would not treat
anybody with anything under age 16,

00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:06.454
which means they were consigning
them to an adult body

00:12:06.478 --> 00:12:07.937
no matter what happened,

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.537
even if they tested them well.

00:12:10.108 --> 00:12:14.786
Jackie, on top of it, was,
by virtue of skeletal markings,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.731
destined to be six feet five.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.042
And yet, she had just begun
a male puberty.

00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:26.513
Well, I did something
a little bit innovative,

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.635
because I do know hormones,

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:30.597
and that estrogen is much more potent

00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:34.411
in closing epiphyses, the growth plates,

00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:37.728
and stopping growth, than testosterone is.

00:12:37.752 --> 00:12:42.481
So we blocked her testosterone
with a blocking hormone,

00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:45.964
but we added estrogen,
not at 16, but at 13.

00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:49.489
And so here she is at 16, on the left.

00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:52.371
And on her 16th birthday,
she went to Thailand,

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.673
where they would do
a genital plastic surgery.

00:12:54.697 --> 00:12:56.573
They will do it at 18 now.

00:12:56.597 --> 00:12:58.637
And she ended up 5'11".

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:02.535
But more than that,
she has normal breast size,

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:04.847
because by blocking testosterone,

00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:08.225
every one of our patients
has normal breast size

00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:11.259
if they get to us at the appropriate age,

00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:12.434
not too late.

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:14.816
And on the far right, there she is.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.665
She went public -- semifinalist
in the Miss England competition.

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:23.571
The judges debated
as to, can they do this?

00:13:24.134 --> 00:13:28.285
And one of them quipped, I'm told,

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:32.275
"But she has more natural self
than half the other contestants."

00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:34.187
(Laughter)

00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:38.458
And some of them
have been rearranged a little bit,

00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:40.566
but it's all her DNA.

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.774
And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.

00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.982
And she was offered contracts as a model,

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:51.131
at which point
she teased me, when she said,

00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:53.700
"You know, I might have had
a better chance as a model

00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:55.432
if you'd made me six feet one."

00:13:55.456 --> 00:13:57.436
(Laughter)

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.611
Go figure.

00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:02.966
So this picture, I think, says it all.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.081
It really says it all.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.384
These are Nicole and brother Jonas,

00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:11.347
identical twin boys,

00:14:12.427 --> 00:14:13.931
and proven to be identical.

00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:19.572
Nicole had affirmed herself
as a girl as early as age three.

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:22.103
At age seven, they changed her name,

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:26.571
and came to me at the very
beginnings of a male puberty.

00:14:26.904 --> 00:14:29.688
Now you can imagine
looking at Jonas at only 14,

00:14:29.712 --> 00:14:32.499
that male puberty is early in this family,

00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:34.562
because he looks more like a 16-year-old.

00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:36.896
But it makes the point all the more,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.205
of why you have to be conscious
of where the patient is.

00:14:40.665 --> 00:14:43.371
Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here,

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:47.562
and Jonas is just going --
biologic control.

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:49.886
This is what Nicole would look like

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.967
if we weren't doing what we were doing.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:54.458
He's got a prominent Adam's apple.

00:14:54.482 --> 00:14:58.039
He's got angular bones
to the face, a mustache,

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.126
and you can see there's
a height difference,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.029
because he's gone through
a growth spurt that she won't get.

00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:04.570
Now Nicole is on estrogen.

00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:07.061
She has a bit of a form to her.

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:11.502
This family went
to the White House last spring,

00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:17.265
because of their work in overturning
an anti-discrimination --

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:19.671
there was a bill that would block

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:24.298
the right of transgender people in Maine
to use public bathrooms,

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.067
and it looked like the bill
was going to pass,

00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:28.798
and that would have been a problem,

00:15:28.822 --> 00:15:32.299
but Nicole went personally
to every legislator in Maine

00:15:32.323 --> 00:15:34.311
and said, "I can do this.

00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:36.327
If they see me, they'll understand

00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:38.497
why I'm no threat in the ladies' room,

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.603
but I can be threatened
in the men's room."

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.126
And then they finally got it.

00:15:44.038 --> 00:15:45.713
So where do we go from here?

00:15:47.022 --> 00:15:51.091
Well, we still have a ways to go
in terms of anti-discrimination.

00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:54.782
There are only 17 states
that have an anti-discrimination law

00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:57.382
against discrimination in housing,

00:15:57.406 --> 00:16:00.498
employment, public accommodation --

00:16:00.522 --> 00:16:03.510
only 17 states, and five of them
are in New England.

00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:05.435
We need less expensive drugs.

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:06.846
They cost a fortune.

00:16:07.164 --> 00:16:11.057
And we need to get
this condition out of the DSM.

00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:15.781
It is as much a psychiatric disease
as being gay and lesbian,

00:16:15.805 --> 00:16:18.724
and that went out the window in 1973,

00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:20.252
and the whole world changed.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:22.994
And this isn't going to break
anybody's budget.

00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:24.485
This is not that common.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.660
But the risks of not
doing anything for them

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:36.477
not only puts all of them at risk
of losing their lives to suicide,

00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:42.753
but it also says something about
whether we are a truly inclusive society.

00:16:42.777 --> 00:16:43.928
Thank you.

00:16:43.952 --> 00:16:47.928
(Applause)
