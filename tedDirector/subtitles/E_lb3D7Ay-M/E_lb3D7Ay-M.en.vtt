00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Last January, my company, Fark.com, was sued

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
AOL, TechCrunch and others

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Gooseberry owned a patent

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
for the creation and distribution

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
of news releases via email.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
(Laughter)

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
but it does happen all the time.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Take something already being done

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and patent it for an emerging technology --

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
like phone calls on the internet

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
or video listings for TV shows

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
or radio but for cellphones,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and so on.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The problem with these patents

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
is that the mechanisms are obscure

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and the patent system is dysfunctional,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
no one knows what the terms were.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And as a result, the patent troll can claim

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
that they won the case.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
this patent on emailing news releases

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
had sort of a fatal flaw

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
as it pertained to myself,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and that was that in the mainstream media world

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
there is only one definition for news release,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and it turns out that is press release --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
as in P.R.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Now my company, Fark,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
deals with news, ostensibly,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and as a result

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
we were not in violation of this patent.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
So case closed, right?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Wrong.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
One of the major problems with patent law is that,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
is actually on the defendant,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
which means you have to prove

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And this can take quite a while.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
You need to know that the average patent troll defense

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
costs two million dollars

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and takes 18 months when you win.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
That is your best case outcome

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
when you get sued by a patent troll.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
in order to defend against this lawsuit,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
but one-by-one they settled out of the case,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
even though -- and this is important --

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
none of these companies

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And they started settling out.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
The reason they settled out

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and much worse if you actually lose.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
especially a small eight-man shop like my company.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Six months into the lawsuit,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
we finally reached the discovery phase.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And in discovery phase,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
we asked the patent troll to please provide

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
screenshots of Fark

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
where the infringement of their patent

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
was actually occurring.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Their attorney:

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.260
"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Never mind the fact

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
with no employees.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
My response:

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
"How about nothing?!"

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.260
(Applause)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
(Laughter)

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
But they settled.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
No counter offer.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Now, as mentioned before,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
one of the reasons I can talk to you about this

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Now how did that happen?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
My attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
It came back signed.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now why? You can call them.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
They're not under NDA either.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
First of all, if you can,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
don't fight the patent, fight the infringement.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Patents are very difficult to overturn.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Secondly, make it clear from the beginning

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that either you have no money at all

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
than actually giving them the money.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Now the reason this works

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is because patent trolls

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
they become less interested in pursuing the case.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Finally, make sure that you can tell them

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that you will make this process

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
as annoying and as painful

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and as difficult as possible for them.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
to get their way.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
It turns out, because they're paid on contingency,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
it works really, really well in reverse.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Don't forget that.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So what does all this mean?

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Well to sum up,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
it boils down to one thing:

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Don't negotiate with terrorists.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
(Applause)

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
than any domestic or foreign

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
terrorist organization in history

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
every year.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And what do they do with that money?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.260
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Now this is the point in the Talk

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And the problem with that

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
is that there are two very large industry groups

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
that have different outcomes in mind

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
for the patent system.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
The health care industry

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
would like stronger protections for inventors.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
The hi-tech industry

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
would like stronger protections for producers.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So unfortunately I'm not smart enough

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to have a solution for the patent troll problem.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
However, I did have this idea,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and it was kind of good.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And I thought, "I should patent this."

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
(Laughter)

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Behold, patent infringement via mobile device --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
defined as a computer which is not stationary.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
My solution: award me this patent

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
and I will troll them out of existence.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Thank you.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
(Applause)
