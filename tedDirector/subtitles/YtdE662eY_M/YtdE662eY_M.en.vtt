00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
In the year 1919,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.160
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.160
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
He proposed that our universe

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
might actually have more than the three dimensions

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
that we are all aware of.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
that for some reason we don't yet see.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
but it has nothing to do with the world around us.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
This particular idea, however --

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
may tell us whether it's right or wrong --

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
So where do we go?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
of having discovered the special theory of relativity

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
and decides to take on a new project,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.160
to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And in that moment, there are many people around

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
who thought that that project had already been resolved.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
that works well, describes the motion of planets,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
the motion of the moon and so forth,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
hitting people on the head.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
All of that could be described using Newton's work.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
because even Newton had written

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself --

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
to figure out how gravity works.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
And let me show you what it is that he found.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
So Einstein found

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
The idea goes like this:

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
imagine space is a substrate of all there is.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
And that communicates the force of gravity.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Even the Earth warps space around it.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Now look at the Moon.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160
that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
We go to a full-frame view of this.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
The Earth itself is kept in orbit

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
because of the Sun's presence.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.160
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.160
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
It really works. It describes the data.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160
He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
That's one theory

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.160
one set of principles, one master equation, if you will.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
So Kaluza said to himself,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Einstein has been able to describe gravity

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
in terms of warps and curves in space --

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
in fact, space and time, to be more precise.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
we know of others today, but at that time

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
that was the only other one people were thinking about.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
You know, the force responsible for electricity

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
and magnetic attraction and so forth.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160
and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Einstein had already used up space and time,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
warps and curves, to describe gravity.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.160
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
He said, if I want to describe one more force,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
maybe I need one more dimension.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
in a universe with four space dimensions, not three,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
those were for gravity --

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And when he looked at that equation,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
it was none other than the equation

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Amazing -- it just popped out.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
He was so excited by this realization

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
that he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
that he had found the unified theory.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.160
Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160
He, in fact --

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
he read a book, a treatise on swimming --

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160
(Laughter)

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
-- then dove into the ocean.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.160
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
two questions immediately arise from his observation.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
We don't seem to see them.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And number two: does this theory really work in detail,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
when you try to apply it to the world around us?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Now, the first question was answered in 1926

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
by a fellow named Oskar Klein.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.160
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
curled up so small, even though they're all around us,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
that we don't see them.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Let me show you that one visually.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
So, imagine you're looking at something

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
like a cable supporting a traffic light.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
a little ant walking around --

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
the long dimension,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
And I hope you appreciate this.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
It took so long to get these ants to do this.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
(Laughter)

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160
big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
are the ones that we can easily see,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
but there might be additional dimensions curled up,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
sort of like the circular part of that cable,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
so small that they have so far remained invisible.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Let me show you what that would look like.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself --

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
Some of you guys will fix that one day,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
goes smaller, smaller, smaller,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
this is the idea,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
you could have additional curled up dimensions --

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
that's like the grid part --

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
or even with any of our most refined equipment.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Now that's an explanation

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160
about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
But what about the second question that I asked:

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
does the theory actually work

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
when you try to apply it to the real world?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
worked on trying to refine this framework

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and apply it to the physics of the universe

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160
In detail, for instance,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
they couldn't get the mass of the electron

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
to work out correctly in this theory.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.160
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
this strange but very compelling idea

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.160
Until something wonderful happened in our age.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.160
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
is being pursued by physicists such as myself,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
many others around the world,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160
has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
but when we study superstring theory,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
So, let me just tell you how that goes.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Superstring theory -- what is it?

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160
making up everything in the world around us?

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
The idea is like this.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.160
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.160
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160
with neutrons and protons.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
That is where conventional ideas stop.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
Here is the new idea of string theory.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160
Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
It looks like a vibrating string --

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
that's where the idea, string theory comes from.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
can vibrate in different patterns,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
these can also vibrate in different patterns.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
They don't produce different musical notes.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
So if these ideas are correct,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.160
this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
It's built up of a huge number

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.160
of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
vibrating in different frequencies.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
The different frequencies produce the different particles.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
The different particles are responsible

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
for all the richness in the world around us.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
And there you see unification,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
because matter particles, electrons and quarks,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.160
radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
under the rubric of vibrating strings.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Now here is the catch.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
When you study the mathematics of string theory,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
you find that it doesn't work

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
and one dimension of time.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.160
It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
that our world, when appropriately described,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
Now you might think about that and say, well,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160
and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
One of the other predictions of string theory --

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160
(Laughter)

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
But it raises the question:

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
or do they tell us something about the world?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.160
First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
in theoretical physics, theoretical science.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
And that question is this: when we look around the world,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
as scientists have done for the last hundred years,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.160
These are numbers like the mass of the particles,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
the strength of the electromagnetic force --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
a list of about 20 numbers

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
that have been measured with incredible precision,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
but nobody has an explanation

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
Now, does string theory offer an answer?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160
Not yet.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.160
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
may rely on the form of the extra dimensions.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
had any other values than the known ones,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160
This is a deep question.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
Why are those numbers so finely tuned

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
to allow stars to shine and planets to form,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
if I had 20 dials up here

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
So can we explain those 20 numbers?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
have to do with the extra dimensions.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
Let me show you how.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
it's not one extra dimension,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.160
as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.160
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
name isn't all that important.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
But, as you can see,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
the extra dimensions fold in on themselves

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.160
and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.160
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
would look like this on the tiniest of scales.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.160
When you swing your hand,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
Consider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
notice that the vibrations of the airstreams

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
are affected by the shape of the instrument.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Now in string theory,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
So just as those airstreams

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
strings themselves will be affected

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
So let me bring some strings into the story.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
they'll be there in a second -- right there,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
notice that they way they vibrate is affected

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
by the geometry of the extra dimensions.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
we don't yet, but if we did --

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
we should be able to calculate the allowed notes,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
the allowed vibrational patterns.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.160
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.160
And if the answer that we get from our calculations

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
agrees with the values of those numbers

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
that have been determined

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
through detailed and precise experimentation,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160
this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.160
for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
that might be able to explain

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.160
some previously unexplained features of the world,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
or can we actually test for these extra dimensions?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
And we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160
that in the next five years or so we may be able to test

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
for the existence of these extra dimensions.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.160
a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
opposite directions, near the speed of light.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
so there's a head-on collision.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
it may eject some of the debris from the collision

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.160
from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
How would we know it?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
compare it to the amount of energy before,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.160
and if there's less energy after the collision than before,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Let me show you that idea visually.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.160
that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
if the extra dimensions are real.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160
But here's how the experiment will go.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
You take these particles. You slam them together.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
You slam them together, and if we are right,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
some of the energy of that collision

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.160
will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
So this is the kind of experiment

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
And if this experiment bears fruit,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
if we see that kind of particle ejected

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
than when we began,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
this will show that the extra dimensions are real.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
And to me this is a really remarkable story,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.160
and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
in which the events of the universe take place.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
Einstein comes along and says,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.160
well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
And now string theory comes along and says,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.160
yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
all together in one package,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.160
but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.160
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.160
Amazing possibility.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160
Thank you very much.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.160
(Applause)
