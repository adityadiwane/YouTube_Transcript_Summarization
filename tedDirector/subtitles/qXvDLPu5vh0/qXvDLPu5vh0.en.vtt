00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
and I've been doing it for two years,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
trying to change how we feed kids in America.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
Everyone says it couldn't be done.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
like, what my vision would be.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
How do we really change children's relationship to food?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And I'll tell you why we need to change it,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
but we absolutely have to change it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
And what I came to understand is,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
we needed to teach children

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
the symbiotic relationship

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
although we've heard otherwise,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
is we're really going to become extinct,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
because we're feeding our children to death.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
That's my premise.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
And the reason this is happening, by and large,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
is because of our food system

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
and the way the government commodifies food,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
the way the government oversees our food,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
and tell them to learn, you know,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
learn what's in those schools.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And when you feed these kids bad food,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
These are -- 10 companies

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
control much of what's in our grocery stores,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
So when I started thinking about these issues

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
and how I was going to change what kids ate,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I really started focusing on what we would teach them.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And the very first thing

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
was about regional food -- trying to eat food

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
from within our region.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
as oil hits its peak oil,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
we should, or could, be moving food

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
1,500 miles before we eat it.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
So we talked to kids about that,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and we really start to feed kids regional food.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
And then we talk about organic food.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
but we, as a nation,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
have to start thinking about

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
consuming, growing and feeding our children

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
food that's not chock-full of chemicals.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
We can't keep doing that.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
You know, it doesn't work.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
And the results of that are kids getting sick.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
is consumed in animal husbandry.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
We are feeding our kids antibiotics

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
in beef and other animal protein every day.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And the result of it is, we have diseases.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
that we can't make kids better when they get sick.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
but it's an issue in the food supply.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
One of my favorite facts is that

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
That means every one of us, and our children,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
those bags you have at home. If I had one here

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and ripped it open,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
and that pile I would have on the floor

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
is what we consume and feed our children every year

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
because of what goes into our food supply,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
because of the way we consume

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
produce in America.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
The USDA allows these antibiotics,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
and the USDA paid for this ad

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
in Time magazine.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
but we know it wasn't good for you and me.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And that has to change, you know.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
The USDA cannot be seen as

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
the be-all and end-all of what we feed

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
our kids and what's allowed.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
That's what I really try and get people to understand.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
It's consuming food in a way

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
in which we'll still have a planet,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
in which kids will grow up to be healthy,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
and which really tries to mitigate

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
all the negative impacts we're seeing.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
It really is just a new idea.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
I mean, people toss around sustainability,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
but we have to figure out what sustainability is.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
we've gone from being 200 --

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
to less than 2 percent of farmers.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And we spend 35,000 dollars

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.160
and school districts spend 500 dollars a year

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
feeding a child.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
(Laughter)

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
And what's happening is, we're getting sick.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
It is about what we feed them.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
What goes in is what we are.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
We really are what we eat.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And if we continue down this path,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
if we continue to feed kids bad food,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
if we continue not to teach them what good food is,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
What's going to happen to our whole medical system?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
What's going to happen is,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
we're going to have kids

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
that have a life less long than our own.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
those seven- and eight-year-olds today --

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
one out of every three Caucasians,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
most before they graduate high school.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
This means that 40 or 45 percent

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
of all school-aged children

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
could be insulin-dependent

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
within a decade. Within a decade.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
What's going to happen?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
Well, the CDC has gone further to say

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160
that those children born in the year 2000

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
could be the first generation

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And it's because of what we feed them.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide --

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and if they do, you should be in therapy.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
You know, we are responsible

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
for what kids eat.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
They spend 500 dollars

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
marketing healthy, nutritious food.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
The result of which is kids think they're going to die

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
if they don't have chicken nuggets.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
is what McDonald's and Burger King

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
and those big companies think we should eat.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And why can they serve that much?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
and 99-cent double burgers?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
It's because of the way the government commodifies food,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
and the cheap corn and cheap soy

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
that are pushed into our food supply

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
that makes these non-nutrient foods

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
really, really cheap.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
This is not even food.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
corn dogs,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
it came frozen in a box.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
The USDA allows this.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
The USDA allows all of this stuff.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
In case you can't tell, that's, like,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
And we, all of us,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
have to understand

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
that this is about us,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
that we can make a difference here.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
but I'm sure you're rich if you did.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
a heart, a giraffe, a star?

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And that they could figure it out,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
that we could sell this stuff to kids.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
that chicken looks like chicken?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
But this is what most schools serve.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
We really need to change

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
this whole paradigm with kids and food.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
We really have to teach children

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
that chicken is not a giraffe.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
You know, that vegetables

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
are actually colorful, that they have flavor,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
that carrots grow in the ground,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
that strawberries grow in the ground.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
You know, we have to change

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.160
the way we teach kids about these things.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
actually getting fresh food into schools.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
We have no high-fructose corn syrup,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
no trans fats, no processed foods.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
We're cooking from scratch every day.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
We have 25 percent of our --

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
(Applause)

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
is organic and local. We cook.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
every day and go cook the food for the kids,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
because this is what we need to do.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
We can't keep serving kids

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
processed crap,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
full of chemicals,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
You're not going to get the next generation,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
or the generation after, to be able to think like this

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
if they're not nourished.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
If they're eating

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
chemicals all the time,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
they're not going to be able to think.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
They're not going to be smart.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
You know what? They're just going to be sick.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
very, very different, and I needed to market it.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
And these calendars really started to lay out my program.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
and all the gardening classes in our school district.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
So this is a typical menu.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
And you see these recipes on the side?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.160
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
If we're going to change children's relationship to food,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes --

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
and academic curriculum to tie it all together.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
This is available on my website in English and Spanish,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
We have to start changing this.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
We have to make kids understand

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
that their food choices make a big difference.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
And why this is so important is

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
that we now have grown a generation,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
What are kids learning? Where is the family time?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Where is socialization? Where is discussion?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Where is learning to talk?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
You know, we have to change it.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
We have to teach kids

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
that Coke and Pop Tarts

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
aren't breakfast.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
of refined sugar,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
We have recycling in all of our schools.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
You know, the things that we maybe do at home

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
and think are so important,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.160
we have to teach kids about in school.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
It has to be so much a part of them

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
that they really get it.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
Because, you know what, many of us

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160
are sort of at the end of our careers,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
and we need to be giving these kids --

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
these young kids, the next generation --

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
the tools to save themselves

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
and save the planet.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
I work with private companies

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
who are willing to do R &amp; D with me,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
who are willing to do distribution for me,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
who are really willing to work to go into schools.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Schools are underfunded.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
Most schools in America spend less

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
That comes down to under five dollars an hour.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.160
for babysitters when you have them.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
And if we're going to change it,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
and change how we feed kids,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
we really have to rethink that.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
So, public and private partnerships,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
advocacy groups, working with foundations.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
In our school district, the way we afford this

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
is our school district allocates .03 percent

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
of the general fund

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
allocated a half to one percent,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
we could start to really fix this program.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
We really need to change it.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
It's going to take more money.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
kids getting exercise.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And one of the simple things we can do

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
is put recess before lunch.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
It's sort of this "duh" thing.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160
believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
We need to --

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
we need to educate.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
We need to educate the kids.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
We need to educate the staff.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
I had 90 employees.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
And, you know, I'm not that better off now.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160
But we really have to educate.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
about ways to teach people how to cook again,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
because, of course, they don't --

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
because we've had this processed food in schools

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
and institutions for so long.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
We need 40-minute lunches --

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
most schools have 20-minute lunches --

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
and lunches that are time-appropriate.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
There was just a big study done, and so many schools

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
That is not lunchtime.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
And just remember,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
at very least tacitly,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
this is what we're teaching children

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
as what they should be doing.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
I think if we're going to fix this,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
one of the things we have to do

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
is really change how we have oversight

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
over the National School Lunch Program.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
I think it should be under CDC.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
If we started to think about food

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
and how we feed our kids

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
as a health initiative,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
and we started thinking about food as health,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
as lunch.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
Okay, Finance 101 on this,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160
and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
because I think this is something we all have to understand.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
feeding 30 million children a year.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160
That number probably needs to double.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160
People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
on fast food.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
We spend 100 billion dollars a year

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
on diet aids.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
which is why we need all the diet aids.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
We spend 200 billion dollars a year

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
on diet-related illness today,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
200 billion.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.160
So you know what, when we talk

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.160
about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.160
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
that's what the government allocates for lunch.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.160
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
That means we spend less than a dollar a day

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
on food for kids in schools --

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160
most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.160
Now I don't know about you,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.160
but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.160
and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
One gourmet coffee,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.160
one, is more --

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
for an entire week

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
in our schools.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.160
You know what? We should be ashamed.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
We, as a country, should be ashamed

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
at that.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
The richest country.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
In our country,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160
it's the kids that need it the most,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
who get this really, really lousy food.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.160
It's the kids who have parents and grandparents

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.160
and uncles and aunts that can't even afford

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
to pay for school lunch that gets this food.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
And those are the same kids

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
who are going to be getting sick.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.160
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160
We can all make a difference.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.160
That every single one of us,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160
whether we have children,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
or anything --

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
that we can make a difference.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
or nieces and nephews shopping

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.160
to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
Sit down and care.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.160
And on the macro level,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160
we're in what seems to be

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.160
a 19-month presidential campaign,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
and of all the things we're asking

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
all of these potential leaders,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160
what about asking for the health of our children?

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.160
Thank you.
