00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:14.810
Growing up in Taiwan

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.422
as the daughter of a calligrapher,

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:18.790
one of my most treasured memories

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.883
was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:24.516
and the form of Chinese characters.

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.023
Ever since then, I was fascinated

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.685
by this incredible language.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:32.420
But to an outsider, it seems to be

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.929
as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.304
Over the past few years, I've been wondering

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.356
if I can break down this wall,

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.950
so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.858
the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:51.170
I started thinking about how a new, fast method

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.018
of learning Chinese might be useful.

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:58.004
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.009
every single stroke for each character

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.553
in the correct sequence.

00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:05.610
I learned new characters every day

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.337
during the course of the next 15 years.

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:10.457
Since we only have five minutes,

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:14.092
it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.617
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:22.729
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.745
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:29.641
40 percent of basic literature --

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.517
enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:35.521
to understand the basic idea of the web pages

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.460
or the newspapers.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.659
Today I'm going to start with eight

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.551
to show you how the method works.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.472
You are ready?

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:46.155
Open your mouth as wide as possible

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.201
until it's square.

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.883
You get a mouth.

00:01:50.883 --> 00:01:53.971
This is a person going for a walk.

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.102
Person.

00:01:57.102 --> 00:01:59.811
If the shape of the fire is a person

00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.081
with two arms on both sides,

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:04.251
as if she was yelling frantically,

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:07.804
"Help! I'm on fire!" --

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:11.971
This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:15.784
but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:18.043
This is a tree.

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:20.141
Tree.

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:24.566
This is a mountain.

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:27.167
The sun.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:34.112
The moon.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.087
The symbol of the door

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:41.793
looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.

00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:45.531
I call these eight characters radicals.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.297
They are the building blocks

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:51.427
for you to create lots more characters.

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:53.165
A person.

00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:57.433
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.561
As the old saying goes,

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.287
two is company, three is a crowd.

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.202
If a person stretched their arms wide,

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.849
this person is saying, "It was this big."

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.697
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:20.543
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:24.037
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.593
Three trees together, we create the forest.

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:31.665
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:35.800
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter)

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.881
Easy to remember,

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:42.823
since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.865
Remember fire?

00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:47.526
Two fires together, I get really hot.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:50.385
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:54.986
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.

00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:58.078
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.

00:03:58.078 --> 00:04:00.257
Two suns together, prosperous.

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:02.615
Three together, that's sparkles.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:04.636
Put the sun and the moon shining together,

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:05.944
it's brightness.

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:10.169
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.652
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:17.755
A door. Put a plank inside the door,

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:19.812
it's a door bolt.

00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:22.776
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:26.107
Knock knock. Is anyone home?

00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:28.995
This person is sneaking out of a door,

00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:31.827
escaping, evading.

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:33.980
On the left, we have a woman.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.142
Two women together, they have an argument.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.275
(Laughter)

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:44.793
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:48.302
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.

00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:51.639
By using this method, the first eight radicals

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.640
will allow you to build 32.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.403
The next group of eight characters

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.595
will build an extra 32.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.897
So with very little effort,

00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:02.163
you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,

00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:04.715
which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:08.262
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.

00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:10.959
For example, the mountain and the fire together,

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:13.887
we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.

00:05:13.887 --> 00:05:17.207
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.

00:05:17.207 --> 00:05:20.625
This is a sun placed with the origin,

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.752
because Japan lies to the east of China.

00:05:23.752 --> 00:05:27.642
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.

00:05:27.642 --> 00:05:30.600
A person behind Japan, what do we get?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.702
A Japanese person.

00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:36.503
The character on the left is two mountains

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.610
stacked on top of each other.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.827
In ancient China, that means in exile,

00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:44.265
because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.636
in exile beyond mountains.

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:51.647
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.

00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:54.218
A mouth which tells you where to get out

00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:56.146
is an exit.

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:59.787
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:01.670
and get off of the stage. Thank you.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.639
(Applause)
