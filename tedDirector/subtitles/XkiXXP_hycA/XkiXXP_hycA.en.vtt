00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I am going to speak about corruption,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
but I would like to juxtapose

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
two different things.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.260
One is the large global economy,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
the large globalized economy,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and the other one is the small, and very limited,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
capacity of our traditional governments

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
and their international institutions

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
to govern, to shape, this economy.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Because there is this asymmetry,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
which creates, basically,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
failing governance.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Failing governance in many areas:

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in the area of exploitation of women and children,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
in the area of climate change,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
in all the areas in which we really need

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
a capacity to reintroduce

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
the primacy of politics

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
into the economy,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
which is operating in a worldwide arena.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And I think corruption,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and the fight against corruption,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and the impact of corruption,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
is probably one of the most interesting ways

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
to illustrate what I mean

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
with this failure of governance.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Let me talk about my own experience.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I used to work as the director

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
of the World Bank office in Nairobi

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
for East Africa.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
At that time, I noticed

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
that corruption, that grand corruption,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that systematic corruption,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
was undermining everything we were trying to do.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And therefore, I began

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
to not only try to protect

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
the work of the World Bank,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
our own projects, our own programs

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
against corruption,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but in general, I thought, "We need a system

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
to protect the people

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in this part of the world

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
from the ravages of corruption."

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And as soon as I started this work,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I received a memorandum from the World Bank,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
from the legal department first,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
in which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
so I want you to stop your doings."

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
In the meantime, I was chairing

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
donor meetings, for instance,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
in which the various donors,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
it is true, it is one of the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
unsafest cities of the world,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
but they like to be there because the other cities

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
are even less comfortable.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And in these donor meetings, I noticed

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that many of the worst projects --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
which were put forward

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
by our clients, by the governments,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
by promoters,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
many of them representing

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
suppliers from the North --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
that the worst projects

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
were realized first.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Let me give you an example:

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
a huge power project,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
300 million dollars,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
to be built smack into

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
areas of western Kenya.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And we all noticed immediately

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that this project had no economic benefits:

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
nobody was interested in irrigation projects.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
To the contrary, we knew that this project

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
would destroy the environment:

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
It would destroy riparian forests,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
which were the basis for

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
the survival of nomadic groups,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
for these hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and the siphoning off

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
of the scarce resources of the economy

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
from much more important activities

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
like schools, like hospitals and so on.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And yet, we all rejected this project,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
none of the donors was willing

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to have their name connected with it,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
and it was the first project to be implemented.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
The good projects, which we as a donor community

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
would take under our wings,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
they took years, you know,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
you had too many studies,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
and very often they didn't succeed.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
But these bad projects,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
for many generations, for the environment,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
for thousands of families who had to be resettled --

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
they were suddenly put together

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
by consortia of banks,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
of supplier agencies,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
of insurance agencies --

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and they came back very, very quickly,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
driven by an unholy alliance

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
between the powerful elites

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
in the countries there

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
and the suppliers from the North.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Now, these suppliers

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
were our big companies.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
They were the actors of this global market,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
which I mentioned in the beginning.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
They were the Siemenses of this world,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
from Canada, from Germany,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and they were systematically driven

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
by systematic, large-scale corruption.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
We are not talking about

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
50,000 dollars here,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
on the Swiss bank accounts,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
of the president's ministers,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
the high officials in the para-statal sectors.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
This was the reality which I saw,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and not only one project like that:

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
I saw, I would say,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
over the years I worked in Africa,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I saw hundreds of projects like this.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And so, I became convinced

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
that it is this systematic corruption

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
which is the main reason

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
for the misery, for the poverty,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
for the conflicts, for the violence,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
for the desperation

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
in many of these countries.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
That we have today

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that we have more than a billion people

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
without proper drinking water in the world,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
twice that number,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
more than two billion people

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
without sanitation and so on,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and the consequent illnesses

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
of mothers and children,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
still, child mortality of more than

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
10 million people every year,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
children dying before they are five years old:

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
The cause of this is, to a large extent,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
grand corruption.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Now, why did the World Bank

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
not let me do this work?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I found out afterwards,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
The reason was that the members of the World Bank

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
thought that foreign bribery was okay,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
including Germany.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
It was even tax-deductible.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
No wonder that most of the most important

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
international operators in Germany,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
but also in France and the UK

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Not all of them, but most of them.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And this is the phenomenon

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
which I call failing governance,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
because when I then came to Germany

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and started this little NGO

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.260
here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
we were told, "You cannot stop

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
our German exporters from bribing,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
because we will lose our contracts.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
We will lose to the French,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
which made it very difficult

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
for an individual company,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
an individual exporting country

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
to say, "We are not going to

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
continue this deadly, disastrous

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
habit of large companies to bribe."

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So this is what I mean

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
with a failing governance structure,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
because even the powerful government,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
which we have in Germany, comparatively,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
was not able to say,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
They needed help,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
and the large companies themselves

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
have this dilemma.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Many of them didn't want to bribe.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Many of the German companies, for instance,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
believe that they are really

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
producing a high-quality product

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
at a good price, so they are very competitive.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
They are not as good at bribing

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
as many of their international competitors are,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
but they were not allowed

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
to show their strengths,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
because the world was eaten up

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
by grand corruption.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.260
And this is why I'm telling you this:

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
Civil society rose to the occasion.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
We had this small NGO,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Transparency International.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
They began to think of

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and we developed concepts

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
of collective action,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
basically trying to bring various competitors

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
together around the table,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
explaining to all of them

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
how much it would be in their interests

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
if they simultaneously would stop bribing,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and to make a long story short,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
we managed to eventually

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
get Germany to sign

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
together with the other OECD countries

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and a few other exporters.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
In 1997, a convention,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
under the auspices of the OECD,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
which obliged everybody

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
to change their laws

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and criminalize foreign bribery.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.260
(Applause)

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
in doing this,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
we had to sit together with the companies.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
we had sessions with about

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
20 captains of industry,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and we discussed with them

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
what to do about international bribery.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
In the first session -- we had three sessions

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
over the course of two years.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
chaired one of the sessions, the first one,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
to take the fear away

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
from the entrepreneurs,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
who were not used to deal

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
with non-governmental organizations.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And in the first session, they all said,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
This is what these other cultures demand.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
They even applaud it.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
In fact, [unclear]

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
still says this today.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And so there are still a lot of people

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But in the second session,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
they admitted already that they would never do this,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
what they are doing in these other countries,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Cabinet ministers would admit this.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
we had them all sign an open letter

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
to the Kohl government, at the time,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
requesting that they

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
participate in the OECD convention.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And this is, in my opinion,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
an example of soft power,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
because we were able to convince them

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
that they had to go with us.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
We had a longer-term time perspective.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
We had a broader,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
geographically much wider,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
constituency we were trying to defend.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
And that's why the law has changed.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
In some other countries, the OECD convention

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
is not yet properly enforced.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And, again, civil societies

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
breathing down the neck of the establishment.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
In London, for instance,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
where the BAE got away

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
with a huge corruption case,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.260
which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
100 million British pounds,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
every year for ten years,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
to one particular official of one particular friendly country,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
who then bought for

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
44 billion pounds of military equipment.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
Why? Because they consider this

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
as contrary to the security interest

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
of the people of Great Britain.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Civil society is pushing, civil society

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
is trying to get a solution to this problem,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
also in the U.K.,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and so on.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
In Germany, we are pushing

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
the ratification of the UN convention,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
which is a subsequent convention.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
We are, Germany, is not ratifying.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Why? Because it would make it necessary

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
to criminalize the corruption

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
of deputies.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
In Germany, we have a system where

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
This is, under German law, allowed,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
and this is why they can't sign

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
one of they very, very few countries

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
but not able to ratify the convention,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
which we managed to get on the books

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
with about 160 countries all over the world.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
I see my time is ticking.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Let me just try to

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
draw some conclusions from what has happened.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I believe that what we managed to achieve

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
in fighting corruption,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
one can also achieve

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
in other areas of failing governance.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
By now, the United Nations

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
is totally on our side.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.260
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
they became, I would say, the strongest

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
anti-corruption agency in the world.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Most of the large companies

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
are now totally convinced

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
that they have to put in place

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
very strong policies

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
against bribery and so on.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
And this is possible because civil society

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
joined the companies

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and joined the government

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
in the analysis of the problem,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
in the development of remedies,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
in the implementation of reforms,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Of course, if civil society organizations

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
want to play that role,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.260
they have to grow into this responsibility.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Not all civil society organizations are good.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So, we must be aware

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
that civil society

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
has to shape up itself.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
They have to have a much more

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
transparent financial governance.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
They have to have a much more participatory governance

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
in many civil society organizations.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
This is why we have set up the governance school

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
because we believe most of our educational

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and research institutions in Germany

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and continental Europe in general,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
do not focus enough, yet,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
on empowering civil society

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and training the leadership of civil society.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience:

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
If civil society does it right

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
and joins the other actors --

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
in particular, governments,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
governments and their international institutions,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
but also large international actors,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
in particular those which have committed themselves

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
to corporate social responsibility --

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
then in this magical triangle

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
between civil society,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
government and private sector,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
there is a tremendous chance

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.260
for all of us to create a better world.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
Thank you.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
(Applause)
