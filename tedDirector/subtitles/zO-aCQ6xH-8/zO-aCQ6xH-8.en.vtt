00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:20.077
(Whistling)

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:18.593
(Whistling ends)

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.739
(Applause)

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:24.236
Thank you.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.836
(Applause)

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.236
Thank you very much.

00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:30.333
That was whistling.

00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:34.236
I'm trying to do this in English.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.352
What is a chubby,
curly-haired guy from Holland --

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:41.009
why is he whistling?

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.464
Well actually, I've been whistling
since the age of four, about four.

00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:46.654
My dad was always whistling
around the house,

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:49.745
and I just thought that's part
of communication in my family.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.468
So I whistled along with him.

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:54.955
And actually, until I was 34,

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.519
I always annoyed and irritated
people with whistling,

00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:01.236
because, to be honest,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.101
my whistling is a kind
of deviant behavior.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.834
I whistled alone,
I whistled in the classroom,

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:11.428
I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:14.948
And I also whistled
at a Christmas Eve party

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:16.693
with my family-in-law.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:21.399
And they had some, in my opinion,
terrible Christmas music.

00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:25.161
And when I hear music that I don't like,
I try to make it better.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:26.567
(Laughter)

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:30.071
So when "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" -- you know it?

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:33.001
(Whistling)

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:34.727
But it can also sound like this.

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.874
(Whistling)

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:40.856
But during a Christmas party --

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.093
at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying.

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:47.576
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times,
"Please stop whistling."

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.888
And I just couldn't.

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:50.113
And at one point --

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.349
and I had some wine,
I have to admit that --

00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:55.648
at one point I said,
"If there was a contest, I would join."

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:57.114
And two weeks later,

00:03:57.138 --> 00:04:00.546
I received a text message:
"You're going to America."

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.236
(Laughter)

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.308
So, OK, I'm going to America.

00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:06.936
I would love to, but why?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.117
So I immediately called her up, of course.

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:13.723
She googled, and she found
this World Whistling Championship

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:15.524
in America, of course.

00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:16.698
(Laughter)

00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:20.236
She didn't expect me to go there.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.399
And I would have lost my face.

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:25.409
I don't know if that's correct English.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.959
But the Dutch people here
will understand what I mean.

00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:30.442
(Laughter)

00:04:30.466 --> 00:04:32.236
I lost my face.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.236
(Applause)

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.852
And she thought, "He will never go there."

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.462
But actually, I did.

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:45.031
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina,
southeast of the United States,

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:47.412
and I entered the world of whistling.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.580
And I also entered the World Championship,

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:53.236
and I won there, in 2004.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.172
(Applause)

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:00.517
That was great fun, of course.

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:07.077
And to defend my title --
like judokas do and sportsmen --

00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:09.442
I thought, well let's go back in 2005 --

00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:10.625
and I won again.

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.085
(Laughter)

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:14.285
Then I couldn't participate
for a few years.

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.851
And in 2008, I entered again
in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.236
So what happened now

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.076
is I'm standing here in Rotterdam,
in the beautiful city, on a big stage,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.010
and I'm talking about whistling.

00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:30.513
And actually, I earn my money
whistling, at the moment.

00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:33.236
So I quit my day job as a nurse.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.236
(Applause)

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.236
And I try to live my dream --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.405
well, actually, it was never my dream,
but it sounds so good.

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:45.236
(Laughter)

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.553
OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.702
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:52.284
Well actually, you are going
to whistle along.

00:05:55.736 --> 00:05:58.174
And then always the same thing happens:

00:05:58.198 --> 00:06:00.972
people are watching each other
and think, "Oh, my God.

00:06:00.996 --> 00:06:03.150
Why? Can I go away?"

00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:04.583
No, you can't.

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:06.527
(Laughter)

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.454
Actually, it's very simple.

00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:11.898
The track that I will whistle
is called "FÃªte de la Belle."

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.231
It's about 80 minutes long.

00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:15.660
(Laughter)

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.236
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.568
And I want to first rehearse
with you your whistling.

00:06:22.427 --> 00:06:24.179
Yes, so I whistle the tone.

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:26.236
(Whistling)

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.476
(Laughter)

00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:30.622
Sorry, I forgot one thing --

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.992
you whistle the same tone as me.

00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:35.865
(Laughter)

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.819
I heard a wide variety of tones.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.107
(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:56.565
(Whistling ends)

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:57.948
This is very promising.

00:06:57.972 --> 00:06:59.159
(Laughter)

00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:00.524
This is very promising.

00:07:00.548 --> 00:07:03.236
I'll ask the technicians
to start the music.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.498
And if it's started,
I just point where you whistle along,

00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:08.095
and we will see what happens.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.254
(Laughter)

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.906
Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.159
(Laughter)

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:23.381
I'm so used to that.

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:24.429
(Laughter)

00:07:24.453 --> 00:07:25.778
I start it myself.

00:07:25.802 --> 00:07:26.963
(Laughter)

00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:28.236
OK, here it is.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.609
(Laughter)

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:33.579
(Music)

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:39.260
(Whistling)

00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:45.519
(Whistling ends)

00:07:45.543 --> 00:07:48.235
(Music)

00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:50.762
OK.

00:07:51.686 --> 00:07:56.926
(Whistling)

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.831
It's easy, isn't it?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.260
(Whistling)

00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:18.609
Now comes the solo,
I propose I do that myself, OK?

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:21.236
(Music)

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.260
(Whistling)

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.513
(Applause)

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.989
Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou,
the World Champion of Whistling.

00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:51.188
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.
