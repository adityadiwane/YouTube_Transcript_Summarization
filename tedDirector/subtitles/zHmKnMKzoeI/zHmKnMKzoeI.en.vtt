Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.223
I try to question the inter-canceling relationship

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:25.102
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:27.278
Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:31.270
the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.622
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:41.828
LB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:44.965
And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:48.500
before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.337
I also want to use this work to let more people

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.029
pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:58.717
In the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:03.341
protesting, reflective

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:05.161
and uncompromising spirit.

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.809
When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:12.165
to better protect myself

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:16.089
and to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter)

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:20.557
After finishing this series of protests,

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:24.637
I started questioning why my fate was like this,

00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:27.371
and I realized that it's not just me --

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.199
all Chinese are as confused as I am.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:33.925
As you can see, these works

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:40.290
are about family planning, election in accordance with the law

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.573
and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.

00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:46.821
This work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").

00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:50.246
"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:57.813
It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.

00:01:57.813 --> 00:01:59.685
From 1998 to 2000,

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.941
21.37 million people

00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:05.718
lost their jobs in China.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:08.642
The six people in the photo

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.565
are Xia Gang workers.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:15.423
I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.

00:02:15.423 --> 00:02:17.589
On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.750
"The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party."

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.413
For half a month

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:25.725
I looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:30.637
We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:35.998
are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible.

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:38.142
This piece is called The Studio.

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:39.397
This spring,

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:41.822
I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:47.084
to shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 --

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.917
I picked the news photos of the day.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:52.229
One is about the war in the Middle East,

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:56.317
and another one is about a public demonstration in France.

00:02:56.317 --> 00:03:01.061
I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.042
This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:09.185
Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:13.038
(Applause)

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:16.029
LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.079
but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.710
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.144
But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.

00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:28.713
Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:31.837
but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:34.790
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.601
But it doesn't work, my eyes are still small.

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.768
LB: This one is about 9/11 memories.

00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:52.613
This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.

00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:56.685
Kenny Scharf's graffiti.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:00.717
(Laughter)

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:04.944
This is Venice, Italy.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.945
Because global temperatures rise,

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:15.989
the sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.553
This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:29.645
Interpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:31.383
LB: This is the Borghese Gallery

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:34.784
in Rome.

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:39.069
When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.805
For instance, why would I make myself invisible?

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:49.381
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think?

00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:05.941
This one is called Instant Noodles.

00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.645
Interpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)

00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:14.533
LB: Since August 2012,

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:19.329
harmful phosphors have been found

00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:21.603
in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.

00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:24.155
These phosphors can even cause cancer.

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:26.012
To create this artwork,

00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:28.100
I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.002
and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.981
And my task is to stand there, trying to be still,

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:38.437
setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:41.645
and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:45.790
on the front of my body. If the background is simple,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.294
I usually have to stand for three to four hours.

00:05:48.294 --> 00:05:50.911
The background of this piece is more complex,

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:55.489
so I need three to four days in advance for preparation.

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:58.629
This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.907
There is no Photoshop involved.

00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:06.134
Interpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.

00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:12.141
There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter)

00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:24.989
LB: These works are on China's cultural memories.

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:26.327
And this one,

00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:28.989
this is about food safety in China.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:34.845
Unsafe food can harm people's health,

00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:38.853
and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)

00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:41.589
The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:46.374
in different countries and at different times.

00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:51.243
I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:55.365
If an artwork is to touch someone,

00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:59.029
it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:03.405
And the repeated struggles in life create artwork,

00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:09.029
no matter in what form.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:30.509
(Music)

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:31.757
That's all I want to say.

00:07:31.757 --> 00:07:35.757
Thank you. (Applause)
