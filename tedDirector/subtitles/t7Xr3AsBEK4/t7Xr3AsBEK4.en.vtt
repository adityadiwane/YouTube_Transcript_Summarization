00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Just a moment ago,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Her text said,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
"Mom, you will rock."

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I love this.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Getting that text

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
was like getting a hug.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And so there you have it.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I embody

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
the central paradox.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I'm a woman

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
who loves getting texts

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
who's going to tell you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that too many of them can be a problem.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Actually that reminder of my daughter

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
brings me to the beginning of my story.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Rebecca was five years old

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and she was sitting right there

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
in the front row.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I had just written a book

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that celebrated our life on the internet

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and I was about to be on the cover

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
of Wired magazine.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
In those heady days,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
we were experimenting

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
with chat rooms and online virtual communities.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And then we unplugged.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I was excited.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And, as a psychologist, what excited me most

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
was the idea

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that we would use what we learned in the virtual world

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
about ourselves, about our identity,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
to live better lives in the real world.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Now fast-forward to 2012.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I'm back here on the TED stage again.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
She sleeps with her cellphone,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
so do I.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
And I've just written a new book,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
but this time it's not one

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
that will get me on the cover

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
of Wired magazine.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So what happened?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm still excited by technology,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
but I believe,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and I'm here to make the case,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that we're letting it take us places

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that we don't want to go.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Over the past 15 years,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I've studied technologies of mobile communication

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
young and old,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
about their plugged in lives.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And what I've found

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
is that our little devices,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
those little devices in our pockets,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
are so psychologically powerful

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that they don't only change what we do,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
they change who we are.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Some of the things we do now with our devices

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
are things that, only a few years ago,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
we would have found odd

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
or disturbing,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but they've quickly come to seem familiar,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
just how we do things.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So just to take some quick examples:

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
People text or do email

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
during corporate board meetings.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
They text and shop and go on Facebook

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
during classes, during presentations,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
actually during all meetings.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
People talk to me about the important new skill

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
of making eye contact

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
while you're texting.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
(Laughter)

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
People explain to me

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that it's hard, but that it can be done.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Parents text and do email

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
at breakfast and at dinner

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
while their children complain

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
about not having their parents' full attention.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
But then these same children

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
deny each other their full attention.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
This is a recent shot

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
of my daughter and her friends

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
being together

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
while not being together.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And we even text at funerals.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I study this.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
We remove ourselves

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
from our grief or from our revery

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and we go into our phones.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Why does this matter?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
It matters to me

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
trouble certainly

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
in how we relate to each other,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
but also trouble

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
in how we relate to ourselves

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and our capacity for self-reflection.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
We're getting used to a new way

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
of being alone together.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
People want to be with each other,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
but also elsewhere --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
connected to all the different places they want to be.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
People want to customize their lives.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
They want to go in and out of all the places they are

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
because the thing that matters most to them

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
is control over where they put their attention.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So you want to go to that board meeting,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
but you only want to pay attention

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to the bits that interest you.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And some people think that's a good thing.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But you can end up

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
hiding from each other,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
even as we're all constantly connected to each other.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
A 50-year-old business man

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
lamented to me

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
he doesn't call.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
because, he says, "They're too busy on their email."

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
But then he stops himself

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I think I should want to,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Across the generations,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
I see that people can't get enough of each other,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
if and only if

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
they can have each other at a distance,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
in amounts they can control.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I call it the Goldilocks effect:

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
not too close, not too far,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
just right.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
But what might feel just right

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
for that middle-aged executive

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
can be a problem for an adolescent

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.260
who needs to develop face-to-face relationships.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
An 18-year-old boy

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
who uses texting for almost everything

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
says to me wistfully,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
"Someday, someday,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
but certainly not now,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
When I ask people

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
"What's wrong with having a conversation?"

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.260
People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
It takes place in real time

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and you can't control what you're going to say."

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
So that's the bottom line.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Texting, email, posting,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
all of these things

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
let us present the self as we want to be.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
We get to edit,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and that means we get to delete,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and that means we get to retouch,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
the face, the voice,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
the flesh, the body --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
not too little, not too much,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
just right.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Human relationships

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
are rich and they're messy

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and they're demanding.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And we clean them up with technology.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And when we do,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
one of the things that can happen

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
is that we sacrifice conversation

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
for mere connection.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
We short-change ourselves.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And over time,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
we seem to forget this,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
or we seem to stop caring.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I was caught off guard

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
when Stephen Colbert

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
asked me a profound question,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
a profound question.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:55.260
He said, "Don't all those little tweets,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
don't all those little sips

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
of online communication,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
add up to one big gulp

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of real conversation?"

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
My answer was no,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
they don't add up.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.260
Connecting in sips may work

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
for gathering discrete bits of information,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
or even for saying, "I love you," --

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
I mean, look at how I felt

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
when I got that text from my daughter --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
but they don't really work

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
for learning about each other,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
for really coming to know and understand each other.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And we use conversations with each other

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to learn how to have conversations

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
with ourselves.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So a flight from conversation

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
can really matter

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
because it can compromise

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
our capacity for self-reflection.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
For kids growing up,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that skill is the bedrock of development.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Over and over I hear,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
"I would rather text than talk."

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And what I'm seeing

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
is that people get so used to being short-changed

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
out of real conversation,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
so used to getting by with less,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
that they've become almost willing

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
to dispense with people altogether.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
So for example,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
many people share with me this wish,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that some day a more advanced version of Siri,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
will be more like a best friend,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
someone who will listen

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
when others won't.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
I believe this wish

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
reflects a painful truth

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that I've learned in the past 15 years.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.260
That feeling that no one is listening to me

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
is very important

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
in our relationships with technology.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
That's why it's so appealing

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
to have a Facebook page

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
or a Twitter feed --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
so many automatic listeners.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
And the feeling that no one is listening to me

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
make us want to spend time

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
with machines that seem to care about us.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
We're developing robots,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
they call them sociable robots,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
that are specifically designed to be companions --

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
to the elderly,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
to our children,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
to us.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Have we so lost confidence

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.260
that we will be there for each other?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
During my research

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
I worked in nursing homes,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and I brought in these sociable robots

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that were designed to give the elderly

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
the feeling that they were understood.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And one day I came in

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and a woman who had lost a child

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
was talking to a robot

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
in the shape of a baby seal.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
It seemed to be following the conversation.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
It comforted her.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And many people found this amazing.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.260
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
with a machine that had no experience

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
of the arc of a human life.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
That robot put on a great show.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And we're vulnerable.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
People experience pretend empathy

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
as though it were the real thing.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.260
So during that moment

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
when that woman

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
was experiencing that pretend empathy,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
It doesn't face death.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
It doesn't know life."

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
And as that woman took comfort

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
in her robot companion,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
I didn't find it amazing;

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.260
in my 15 years of work.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
But when I stepped back,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
I felt myself

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
at the cold, hard center

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
of a perfect storm.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
We expect more from technology

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
and less from each other.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And I ask myself,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
"Why have things come to this?"

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And I believe it's because

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
technology appeals to us most

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
where we are most vulnerable.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And we are vulnerable.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
We're lonely,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
but we're afraid of intimacy.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
And so from social networks to sociable robots,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
we're designing technologies

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
that will give us the illusion of companionship

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
without the demands of friendship.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
We turn to technology to help us feel connected

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
in ways we can comfortably control.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
But we're not so comfortable.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
We are not so much in control.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
These days, those phones in our pockets

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
are changing our minds and hearts

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
because they offer us

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
three gratifying fantasies.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
One, that we can put our attention

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
wherever we want it to be;

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
two, that we will always be heard;

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and three, that we will never have to be alone.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And that third idea,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
that we will never have to be alone,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
is central to changing our psyches.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
Because the moment that people are alone,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
even for a few seconds,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
they become anxious, they panic, they fidget,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
they reach for a device.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
Just think of people at a checkout line

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
or at a red light.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And so people try to solve it by connecting.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
But here, connection

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
is more like a symptom than a cure.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
It expresses, but it doesn't solve,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
an underlying problem.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But more than a symptom,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
constant connection is changing

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
the way people think of themselves.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
It's shaping a new way of being.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
The best way to describe it is,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
I share therefore I am.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
We use technology to define ourselves

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
by sharing our thoughts and feelings

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
even as we're having them.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
So before it was:

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
I have a feeling,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
I want to make a call.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Now it's: I want to have a feeling,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
I need to send a text.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
The problem with this new regime

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
of "I share therefore I am"

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
is that, if we don't have connection,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
we don't feel like ourselves.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
We almost don't feel ourselves.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
So what do we do? We connect more and more.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
But in the process,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
we set ourselves up to be isolated.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.260
How do you get from connection to isolation?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
You end up isolated

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
the ability to be separate,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
to gather yourself.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Solitude is where you find yourself

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
so that you can reach out to other people

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and form real attachments.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
When we don't have the capacity for solitude,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
or in order to feel alive.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
When this happens,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
we're not able to appreciate who they are.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
It's as though we're using them

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
as spare parts

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
to support our fragile sense of self.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
We slip into thinking that always being connected

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
is going to make us feel less alone.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
But we're at risk,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
because actually it's the opposite that's true.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
If we're not able to be alone,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
we're going to be more lonely.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And if we don't teach our children to be alone,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
they're only going to know

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
how to be lonely.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
When I spoke at TED in 1996,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
reporting on my studies

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
of the early virtual communities,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
I said, "Those who make the most

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
of their lives on the screen

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And that's what I'm calling for here, now:

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
reflection and, more than that, a conversation

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
about where our current use of technology

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
may be taking us,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
what it might be costing us.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
We're smitten with technology.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And we're afraid, like young lovers,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
that too much talking might spoil the romance.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
But it's time to talk.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
We grew up with digital technology

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and so we see it as all grown up.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
But it's not, it's early days.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
There's plenty of time

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
for us to reconsider how we use it,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
how we build it.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
I'm not suggesting

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that we turn away from our devices,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
just that we develop a more self-aware relationship

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
with them, with each other

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
and with ourselves.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
I see some first steps.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
Start thinking of solitude

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
as a good thing.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
Make room for it.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
Find ways to demonstrate this

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
as a value to your children.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Create sacred spaces at home --

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
the kitchen, the dining room --

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
and reclaim them for conversation.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
Do the same thing at work.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
At work, we're so busy communicating

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
that we often don't have time to think,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
we don't have time to talk,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
about the things that really matter.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
Change that.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.260
including to the boring bits.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Because it's when we stumble

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
or hesitate or lose our words

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that we reveal ourselves to each other.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
Technology is making a bid

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
to redefine human connection --

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
how we care for each other,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
how we care for ourselves --

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
but it's also giving us the opportunity

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
to affirm our values

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
and our direction.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
I'm optimistic.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
We have everything we need to start.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
We have each other.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
And we have the greatest chance of success

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
if we recognize our vulnerability.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
That we listen

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
when technology says

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
it will take something complicated

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
and promises something simpler.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
So in my work,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
I hear that life is hard,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
relationships are filled with risk.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
And then there's technology --

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
simpler, hopeful,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
optimistic, ever-young.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
It's like calling in the cavalry.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
An ad campaign promises

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
that online and with avatars,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.260
you can "Finally, love your friends

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
love your body, love your life,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.260
online and with avatars."

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
We're drawn to virtual romance,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
to computer games that seem like worlds,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.260
to the idea that robots, robots,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
will someday be our true companions.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.260
We spend an evening on the social network

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
instead of going to the pub with friends.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
But our fantasies of substitution

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
have cost us.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
Now we all need to focus

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
on the many, many ways

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
technology can lead us back

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
to our real lives, our own bodies,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
our own communities,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
our own politics,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.260
our own planet.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
They need us.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
Let's talk about

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
how we can use digital technology,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.260
the technology of our dreams,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
to make this life

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
the life we can love.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
Thank you.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:42.260
(Applause)
