00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.318
"Pheromone" is a very powerful word.

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:20.462
It conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:24.154
and you can see, it's very important as a word.

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:29.437
But it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:31.986
Now, if you put that word into the web,

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.496
as you may have done,

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.888
you'll come up with millions of hits,

00:00:35.888 --> 00:00:38.533
and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.792
something to make you irresistible

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:43.865
for 10 dollars or more.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.088
Now, this is a very attractive idea,

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.530
and the molecules they mention

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.444
sound really science-y.

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:52.028
They've got lots of syllables.

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:54.901
It's things like androstenol, androstenone

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.342
or androstadienone.

00:00:57.342 --> 00:00:58.984
It gets better and better,

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.774
and when you combine that with white lab coats,

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:03.186
you must imagine that there is

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:05.700
fantastic science behind this.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.822
But sadly, these are fraudulent claims

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:14.161
supported by dodgy science.

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.779
The problem is that, although there are many

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.324
good scientists working on what they think

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:21.194
are human pheromones,

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:23.799
and they're publishing in respectable journals,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.380
at the basis of this,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.716
despite very sophisticated experiments,

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:31.269
there really is no good science behind it,

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:34.561
because it's based on a problem,

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.011
which is nobody has systematically gone through

00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.112
all the odors that humans produce --

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:42.890
and there are thousands of
molecules that we give off.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.000
We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.144
Nobody has gone through systematically

00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:50.911
to work out which molecules really are pheromones.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.541
They've just plucked a few,

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:54.430
and all these experiments are based on those,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.440
but there's no good evidence at all.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.618
Now, that's not to say

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:01.780
that smell is not important to people.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.282
It is, and some people are real enthusiasts,

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.779
and one of these was Napoleon.

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.571
And famously, you may remember

00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.668
that out on the campaign trail for war,

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:16.475
he wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.709
saying, "Don't wash. I'm coming home."

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.311
(Laughter)

00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:23.232
So he didn't want to lose any of her richness

00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:25.581
in the days before he'd get home,

00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.958
and it is still, you'll find websites

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.860
that offer this as a major quirk.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.024
At the same time, though,

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:35.477
we spend about as much money

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:37.248
taking the smells off us

00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:39.969
as putting them back on in perfumes,

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.160
and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.563
So what I want to do in the rest of this talk

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:51.841
is tell you about what pheromones really are,

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.839
tell you why I think we would expect

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.587
humans to have pheromones,

00:02:57.587 --> 00:03:02.080
tell you about some of the
confusions in pheromones,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.872
and then finally, I want to end with

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:06.842
a promising avenue which shows us

00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:10.990
the way we ought to be going.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.171
So the ancient Greeks knew

00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:19.225
that dogs sent invisible signals between each other.

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:21.599
A female dog in heat

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.515
sent an invisible signal to male dogs

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:24.970
for miles around,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.075
and it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:29.256
You could take the smell from the female dog,

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:31.719
and the dogs would chase the cloth.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.327
But the problem for everybody

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:35.440
who could see this effect

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.062
was that you couldn't identify the molecules.

00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:39.515
You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:40.830
The reason for that, of course,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.245
is that each of these animals

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:43.851
produces tiny quantities,

00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:45.510
and in the case of the dog,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.412
males dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:52.770
And it was only in 1959 that a German team,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.122
after spending 20 years in
search of these molecules,

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.903
discovered, identified, the first pheromone,

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:03.181
and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:06.855
Now, this was an inspired choice 
by Adolf Butenandt and his team,

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:08.981
because he needed half a million moths

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.008
to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:14.097
But he created the model

00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:16.461
for how you should go about pheromone analysis.

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:19.142
He basically went through systematically,

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:22.087
showing that only the molecule in question

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:23.953
was the one that stimulated the males,

00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:26.006
not all the others.

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:28.164
He analyzed it very carefully.

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:29.981
He synthesized the molecule,

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.289
and then tried the synthesized
molecule on the males

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.150
and got them to respond and showed it was,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.910
indeed, that molecule.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.060
That's closing the circle.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.765
That's the thing which has
never been done with humans:

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:46.375
nothing systematic, no real demonstration.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:48.109
With that new concept,

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.818
we needed a new word,

00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:52.653
and that was the word "pheromone,"

00:04:52.653 --> 00:04:56.254
and it's basically transferred excitement,

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.523
transferred between individuals,

00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:01.349
and since 1959, pheromones have been found

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.224
right the way across the animal kingdom,

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:05.426
in male animals, in female animals.

00:05:05.426 --> 00:05:06.971
It works just as well underwater

00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:08.993
for goldfish and lobsters.

00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:10.740
And almost every mammal you can think of

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.563
has had a pheromone identified,

00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:16.393
and of course, an enormous number of insects.

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:18.362
So we know that pheromones exist

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:21.423
right the way across the animal kingdom.

00:05:21.423 --> 00:05:23.196
What about humans?

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:24.444
Well, the first thing, of course,

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:26.101
is that we're mammals,

00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:27.660
and mammals are smelly.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.536
As any dog owner can tell you,

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:31.517
we smell, they smell.

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:33.498
But the real reason we might think

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.323
that humans have pheromones

00:05:35.323 --> 00:05:38.541
is the change that occurs as we grow up.

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.992
The smell of a room of teenagers

00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:42.481
is quite different

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:45.301
from the smell of a room of small children.

00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:48.173
What's changed? And of course, it's puberty.

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:49.632
Along with the pubic hair

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:51.325
and the hair in the armpits,

00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:55.067
new glands start to secrete in those places,

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.682
and that's what's making the change in smell.

00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:59.830
If we were any other kind of mammal,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.019
or any other kind of animal,

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:02.156
we would say,

00:06:02.156 --> 00:06:04.028
"That must be something to do with pheromones,"

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.684
and we'd start looking properly.

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:08.660
But there are some problems, and this is why,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.729
I think, people have not looked for

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.646
pheromones so effectively in humans.

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:16.217
There are, indeed, problems.

00:06:16.217 --> 00:06:18.401
And the first of these

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:19.918
is perhaps surprising.

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:21.752
It's all about culture.

00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:23.899
Now moths don't learn a lot

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.516
about what is good to smell, but humans do,

00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:29.362
and up to the age of about four,

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:32.081
any smell, no matter how rancid,

00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:33.880
is simply interesting.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.932
And I understand that the major role of parents

00:06:35.932 --> 00:06:39.613
is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,

00:06:39.613 --> 00:06:42.411
because it's always something nice to smell.

00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.102
But gradually we learn what's not good,

00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:46.592
and one of the things we learn

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:48.727
at the same time as what is not good

00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:50.485
is what is good.

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:52.747
Now, the cheese behind me

00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:56.698
is a British, if not an English, delicacy.

00:06:56.698 --> 00:07:00.135
It's ripe blue Stilton.

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:04.497
Liking it is incomprehensible to
people from other countries.

00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:07.782
Every culture has its own special food

00:07:07.782 --> 00:07:09.878
and national delicacy.

00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:11.930
If you were to come from Iceland,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.254
your national dish

00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:16.230
is deep rotted shark.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.360
Now, all of these things are acquired tastes,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.520
but they form almost a badge of identity.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.340
You're part of the in-group.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.922
The second thing is the sense of smell.

00:07:29.922 --> 00:07:33.391
Each of us has a unique odor world,

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:35.930
in the sense that what we smell,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.789
we each smell a completely different world.

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.498
Now, smell was the hardest

00:07:40.498 --> 00:07:42.359
of the senses to crack,

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:44.074
and the Nobel Prize awarded to

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:45.707
Richard Axel and Linda Buck

00:07:45.707 --> 00:07:48.140
was only awarded in 2004

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.930
for their discovery of how smell works.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.307
It's really hard,

00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.898
but in essence, nerves from the brain

00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:57.111
go up into the nose

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.492
and on these nerves exposed in the nose

00:07:59.492 --> 00:08:02.546
to the outside air are receptors,

00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:05.695
and odor molecules coming in on a sniff

00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:07.845
interact with these receptors,

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:12.104
and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal

00:08:12.104 --> 00:08:14.412
which goes back into the brain.

00:08:14.412 --> 00:08:16.474
We don't just have one kind of receptor.

00:08:16.474 --> 00:08:18.350
If you're a human, you have about 400

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.415
different kinds of receptors,

00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:23.382
and the brain knows what you're smelling

00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:25.193
because of the combination of receptors

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:27.706
and nerve cells that they trigger,

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.264
sending messages up to the brain

00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:32.170
in a combinatorial fashion.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.160
But it's a bit more complicated,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.295
because each of those 400

00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.446
comes in various variants,

00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:39.517
and depending which variant you have,

00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:43.699
you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:46.317
either as something delicious and savory

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.491
or something like soap.

00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.177
So we each have an individual world of smell,

00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:52.818
and that complicates anything

00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:55.114
when we're studying smell.

00:08:55.114 --> 00:08:57.806
Well, we really ought to talk about armpits,

00:08:57.806 --> 00:09:01.202
and I have to say that I do
have particularly good ones.

00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:03.204
Now, I'm not going to share them with you,

00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:05.183
but this is the place that most people

00:09:05.183 --> 00:09:06.920
have looked for pheromones.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.423
There is one good reason,

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.827
which is, the great apes have armpits

00:09:11.827 --> 00:09:14.155
as their unique characteristic.

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:16.556
The other primates have scent glands

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.386
in other parts of the body.

00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:20.740
The great apes have these armpits

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.957
full of secretory glands

00:09:22.957 --> 00:09:25.298
producing smells all the time,

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.998
enormous numbers of molecules.

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:30.701
When they're secreted from the glands,

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.705
the molecules are odorless.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.780
They have no smell at all,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.749
and it's only the wonderful bacteria

00:09:36.749 --> 00:09:38.962
growing on the rainforest of hair

00:09:38.962 --> 00:09:40.418
that actually produces the smells

00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:42.439
that we know and love.

00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:44.339
And so incidentally, if you want to reduce

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:45.769
the amount of smell,

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:47.689
clear-cutting your armpits

00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:49.945
is a very effective way of reducing

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:51.459
the habitat for bacteria,

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:53.796
and you'll find they remain less smelly

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:55.890
for much longer.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.436
But although we've focused on armpits,

00:09:58.436 --> 00:09:59.803
I think it's partly because they're the least

00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:03.770
embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.382
There is actually another reason why we might not

00:10:06.382 --> 00:10:09.158
be looking for a universal sex pheromone there,

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:12.997
and that's because 20 percent
of the world's population

00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:16.442
doesn't have smelly armpits like me.

00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:20.358
And these are people from China, Japan,

00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.953
Korea, and other parts of northeast Asia.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:26.477
They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors

00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:30.730
that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.079
that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:35.184
as characteristic of armpits.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:39.691
So it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world.

00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:42.693
So what should we be doing

00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:45.746
in our search for human pheromones?

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:48.198
I'm fairly convinced that we do have them.

00:10:48.198 --> 00:10:50.151
We're mammals, like everybody else

00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:54.130
who's a mammal, and we probably do have them.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.713
But what I think we should do

00:10:55.713 --> 00:10:57.652
is go right back to the beginning,

00:10:57.652 --> 00:10:59.991
and basically look all over the body.

00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:01.682
No matter how embarrassing,

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:05.060
we need to search and go for the first time

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.520
where no one else has dared tread.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.668
It's going to be difficult,

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.243
it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.

00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:14.190
We also need to go back to the ideas

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.457
that Butenandt used when he
was studying the silk moth.

00:11:17.457 --> 00:11:20.925
We need to go back and look systematically

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:23.063
at all the molecules that are being produced,

00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:25.496
and work out which ones are really involved.

00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:27.602
It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple

00:11:27.602 --> 00:11:29.546
and say, "They'll do."

00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:30.945
We have to actually demonstrate

00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:33.755
that they really have the effects we claim.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.989
There is one team that I'm
actually very impressed by.

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:40.165
They're in France, and their previous success

00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:44.542
was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:47.111
They've turned their attention now

00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:50.296
to human babies and mothers.

00:11:50.296 --> 00:11:53.367
So this is a baby having a drink of milk

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:56.010
from its mother's breast.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.193
Her nipple is completely hidden

00:11:58.193 --> 00:11:59.439
by the baby's head,

00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:03.190
but what you'll notice is a white droplet

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.971
with an arrow pointing to it,

00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:08.170
and that's the secretion from the areolar glands.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.160
Now, we all have them, men and women,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.978
and these are the little bumps around the nipple,

00:12:13.978 --> 00:12:15.937
and if you're a lactating woman,

00:12:15.937 --> 00:12:18.274
these start to secrete.

00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:20.863
It's a very interesting secretion.

00:12:20.863 --> 00:12:23.866
What Benoist Schaal and his team developed

00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:26.273
was a simple test to investigate

00:12:26.273 --> 00:12:29.079
what the effect of this secretion might be,

00:12:29.079 --> 00:12:32.055
in effect, a simple bioassay.

00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:34.730
So this is a sleeping baby,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.719
and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:41.830
The baby remains sleeping,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.171
showing no interest at all.

00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:46.245
But if we go to any mother

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:48.674
who is secreting from the areolar glands,

00:12:48.674 --> 00:12:50.251
so it's not about recognition,

00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:52.479
it can be from any mother,

00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:53.831
if we take the secretion

00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:56.735
and now put it under the baby's nose,

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.826
we get a very different reaction.

00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:01.810
It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.870
and it opens its mouth

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.523
and sticks out its tongue

00:13:05.523 --> 00:13:07.610
and starts to suck.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.950
Now, since this is from any mother,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.742
it could really be a pheromone.

00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:13.521
It's not about individual recognition.

00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:15.397
Any mother will do.

00:13:15.397 --> 00:13:16.860
Now, why is this important,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.318
apart from being simply very interesting?

00:13:19.318 --> 00:13:21.125
It's because women vary

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:23.898
in the number of areolar glands that they have,

00:13:23.898 --> 00:13:26.094
and there is a correlation between the ease

00:13:26.094 --> 00:13:28.636
with which babies start to suckle

00:13:28.636 --> 00:13:30.498
and the number of areolar glands she has.

00:13:30.498 --> 00:13:33.296
It appears that the more secretions she's got,

00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:36.958
the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.

00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.418
If you're a mammal,

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.961
the most dangerous time in life

00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:43.270
is the first few hours after birth.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.030
You have to get that first drink of milk,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.521
and if you don't get it, you won't survive.

00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:51.985
You'll be dead.

00:13:51.985 --> 00:13:54.623
Since many babies actually find it difficult

00:13:54.623 --> 00:13:56.272
to take that first meal,

00:13:56.272 --> 00:13:58.249
because they're not getting the right stimulus,

00:13:58.249 --> 00:14:01.459
if we could identify what that molecule was,

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:03.446
and the French team are being very cautious,

00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:05.561
but if we could identify the molecule,

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:08.355
synthesize it, it would then mean

00:14:08.355 --> 00:14:10.261
premature babies would be more likely to suckle,

00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:13.189
and every baby would have a better chance

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:14.510
of survival.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.050
So what I want to argue is this is one example

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.646
of where a systematic, really scientific approach

00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:23.368
can actually bring you a real understanding

00:14:23.368 --> 00:14:24.476
of pheromones.

00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:27.090
There could be all sorts of medical interventions.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.344
There could be all sorts of things

00:14:28.344 --> 00:14:30.044
that humans are doing with pheromones

00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:32.092
that we simply don't know at the moment.

00:14:32.092 --> 00:14:33.978
What we need to remember is pheromones

00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:35.356
are not just about sex.

00:14:35.356 --> 00:14:37.072
They're about all sorts of things to do

00:14:37.072 --> 00:14:38.795
with a mammal's life.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.484
So do go forward and do search for more.

00:14:41.484 --> 00:14:42.524
There's lots to find.

00:14:42.524 --> 00:14:44.390
Thank you very much.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.878
(Applause)
