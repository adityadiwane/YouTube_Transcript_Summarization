00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.616
We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:26.502
We are at war with a new form of terrorism.

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:30.004
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.466
but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.914
One of the big things about countering terrorism

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.246
is, how do you perceive it?

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.742
Because perception leads to your response to it.

00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:48.970
So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.918
it would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.531
So how are you going to respond to it?

00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.165
Naturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:01.996
You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:06.252
and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:10.215
then naturally from that, the responses that come out of it

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.863
are much more asymmetrical.

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:17.970
We live in a modern, global world.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.452
Terrorists have actually adapted to it.

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:25.201
It's something we have to, too, and that means the people

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.341
who are working on counterterrorism responses

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.165
have to start, in effect, putting on

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:35.419
their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:40.212
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at

00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:43.716
terrorism as though it was a global brand,

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:45.345
say, Coca-Cola.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:51.362
Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)

00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:55.392
If you look at it as a brand in those ways,

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:58.656
what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:01.749
As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.755
it's bad for those who it affects,

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.788
and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:10.404
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:15.396
You're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.866
It's not going to happen, I don't think.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:21.844
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.765
by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:28.043
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.796
The brand has an Achilles' heel.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:32.563
We've mentioned the health,

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:36.243
but it needs consumers to buy into it.

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:40.323
The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:43.024
They're the people who buy into the brand, support them,

00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:46.332
facilitate them, and they're the people

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.847
we've got to reach out to.

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:51.707
We've got to attack that brand in front of them.

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:55.960
There's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.238
One is reducing their market. What I mean is,

00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:04.014
it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.

00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:06.266
We've got to show we're a better product.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:09.423
If I'm trying to show we're a better product,

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:14.354
I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:18.019
We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.667
for the product itself. You could be looking there at

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:25.252
poverty, injustice, all those sorts of things

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:26.781
which feed terrorism.

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:30.513
The other thing to do is to knock the product,

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:32.708
attack the brand myth, as we've said.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:36.067
You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:40.763
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.

00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:43.857
We've got to reveal the dangers in the product.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.506
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:48.707
as I've said, the terrorists.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.094
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism,

00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:55.901
which is those who finance, those who facilitate it,

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.814
but it's the consumers of terrorism.

00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:01.048
We've got to get in to those homelands.

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:04.517
That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:06.869
That's where their consumers come from.

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.781
And we have to get our messaging in there.

00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.630
So the essentials are, we've got to have interaction

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.973
in those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.

00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:21.108
We've got to engage, we've got to educate,

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:23.911
and we've got to have dialogue.

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:28.062
Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,

00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:31.314
think about delivery mechanisms.

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:32.947
How are we going to do these attacks?

00:04:32.947 --> 00:04:35.956
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:39.474
and civil society. We've got to show we're better.

00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:43.316
We've got to show our values.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.618
We've got to practice what we preach.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.831
But when it comes to knocking the brand,

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.303
if the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,

00:04:52.303 --> 00:04:56.317
I don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,

00:04:56.317 --> 00:04:58.199
anyone's going to believe us.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.524
So we've got to find a different mechanism,

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:02.916
and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:05.573
is the victims of terrorism.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.486
They are somebody who can actually stand there and say,

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:12.914
"This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:16.360
It burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.003
You can see their scars. You trust them.

00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:24.268
But whether it's victims, whether it's governments,

00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:29.973
NGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:34.075
we have to interact and engage with those different

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:38.670
layers of terrorism, and, in effect,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.717
we do have to have a little dance with the devil.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.700
This is my favorite part of my speech.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.956
I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,

00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:52.678
but — (Laughter) —

00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:55.466
TED, for health and safety reasons, have told me

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:56.972
I've got to do a countdown, so

00:05:56.972 --> 00:06:00.270
I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.684
sort of a health and safety terrorist, and I — (Laughter) —

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:08.993
I've got to count 3, 2, 1, and

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:12.320
it's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.078
and it would be, "Body parts, not heart attacks."

00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:20.569
So 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.516
Very good. (Laughter)

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:33.325
Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.450
We're all victims of terrorism.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.351
There's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.

00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:44.426
There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.

00:06:44.426 --> 00:06:46.910
The son's dead. The father lives.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.831
The father will probably kick himself for years to come

00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:57.070
that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.083
He's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:03.443
going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.

00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:07.187
There's a very young, attractive lady over here,

00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:10.215
and she has something which I think's the worst form

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:13.011
of psychological, physical injury I've ever seen

00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.707
out of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:18.860
What it means is, when she sat in a restaurant

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.865
in years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,

00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:24.347
or she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:27.320
rubbing her skin, and out of there will come

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.554
a piece of that shrapnel.

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:34.786
And that is a hard thing for the head to take.

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:37.714
There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs

00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:41.226
in this bombing.

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:45.310
She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.417
of money off our government

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:52.709
for looking after what's happened to her.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:54.849
She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.550
universities. She's going to give up university

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.279
to look after Mum.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.811
We're all here, and all of those who watch it

00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:06.450
are going to be traumatized by this event,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.598
but all of you here who are victims are going to learn

00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:11.180
some hard truths.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.901
That is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:19.789
we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:23.366
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:26.374
and what I'm going to try and show is that actually,

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:29.158
victims are the best weapon we have

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:32.334
against more terrorism.

00:08:32.334 --> 00:08:36.550
How would the government at the turn of the millennium

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.775
approach today? Well, we all know.

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:41.379
What they'd have done then is an invasion.

00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:44.557
If the suicide bomber was from Wales,

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.902
good luck to Wales, I'd say.

00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:50.654
Knee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation --

00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:54.353
which hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know --

00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:57.526
it's a mistake.

00:08:57.526 --> 00:09:00.981
We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,

00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:05.411
throughout the U.K., for Welsh people.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:11.056
Today's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:13.294
They are looking at what I've started off on,

00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:16.848
on these more asymmetrical approaches to it,

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.550
more modernist views, cause and effect.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.327
But mistakes of the past are inevitable.

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:23.827
It's human nature.

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:27.563
The fear and the pressure to do something on them

00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:29.843
is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.

00:09:29.843 --> 00:09:33.488
They're not just going to be smart.

00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:36.802
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:39.857
the point very beautifully. He said,

00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:41.969
"The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got

00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:46.433
to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."

00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:49.673
So what we need to do is we have to effect it.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.429
We've got to start thinking about being more proactive.

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:57.117
We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons

00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:58.738
in this war on terrorism.

00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:07.186
But of course, it's ideas -- is not something that governments do very well.

00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:11.365
I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of

00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:15.559
brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:19.470
We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.491
They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth

00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:28.714
against injustice, imperialism, etc.

00:10:28.714 --> 00:10:32.705
We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.

00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:35.879
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:38.752
They actually want our cultural souls, and that's why

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:42.763
the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.

00:10:42.763 --> 00:10:47.343
If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially

00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:51.883
a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere

00:10:51.883 --> 00:10:54.022
which not many people had heard of.

00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:58.186
9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:03.055
and it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.

00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:06.983
They were effectively [doing] something in this brand image

00:11:06.983 --> 00:11:10.167
of creating a brand which can be franchised around

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:15.827
the world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.

00:11:15.827 --> 00:11:19.890
We, as I've said, have got to hit that market,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.349
but we've got to use our heads rather than our might.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:27.123
If we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:31.562
we will not resolve or counter terrorism.

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:34.922
What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:40.353
from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.

00:11:40.353 --> 00:11:44.042
The first one has been dubbed "lawfare,"

00:11:44.042 --> 00:11:46.484
for want of a better word.

00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:50.684
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,

00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:53.050
everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.814
and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.

00:11:56.814 --> 00:11:58.427
There's a bomb, people start suing.

00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:02.118
But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.

00:12:02.118 --> 00:12:05.857
A civil action was brought from 1998.

00:12:05.857 --> 00:12:09.265
In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,

00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:11.480
middle of a peace process.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.623
That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:18.871
for lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.088
and what was going on, the greater good.

00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:23.583
It also meant, then, if you can imagine this,

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:25.886
that the people who bombed your children

00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:31.243
and your husbands were walking around the supermarket

00:12:31.243 --> 00:12:32.927
that you lived in.

00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:36.689
Some of those victims said enough is enough.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:40.123
We brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,

00:12:40.123 --> 00:12:42.718
we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on

00:12:42.718 --> 00:12:44.533
at the moment so I have to be a bit careful,

00:12:44.533 --> 00:12:46.635
but I'm fairly confident.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.269
Why was it effective?

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.906
It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done

00:12:50.906 --> 00:12:52.645
where there was a huge void.

00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:57.271
It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,

00:12:57.271 --> 00:12:59.350
their whole strength is from the fact that they are

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.096
an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog

00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:07.236
and flipped it, they didn't know what to do.

00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:11.487
They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.

00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:15.775
The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action.

00:13:15.775 --> 00:13:19.480
We became, or those victims became, more importantly,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.456
a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.

00:13:23.456 --> 00:13:26.255
There's other examples. We have a case called Almog

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:30.447
which is to do with a bank that was,

00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:33.453
allegedly, from our point of view,

00:13:33.453 --> 00:13:37.368
giving rewards to suicide bombers.

00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:40.376
Just by bringing the very action,

00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:42.887
that bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,

00:13:42.887 --> 00:13:45.291
the powers that be around the world, which for real politic

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.634
reasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,

00:13:48.634 --> 00:13:50.164
because there was lots of competing interests,

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:53.148
have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.

00:13:53.148 --> 00:13:55.863
There's another case called the McDonald case,

00:13:55.863 --> 00:14:00.185
where some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:06.804
which were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:11.741
and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.

00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.694
New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,

00:14:14.694 --> 00:14:18.326
and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there.

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:22.609
But the problem is, we need more and more support

00:14:22.609 --> 00:14:25.411
for these ideas and cases.

00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:29.837
Civil affairs and civil society initiatives.

00:14:29.837 --> 00:14:32.364
A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.

00:14:32.364 --> 00:14:34.170
If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.796
like a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:39.783
What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.

00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:42.007
They used to be fisherman, of course,

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.203
but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:48.498
in their water, so what we're trying to do is create

00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:50.984
security and employment by bringing a coastguard

00:14:50.984 --> 00:14:54.321
along with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.185
as that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have

00:14:57.185 --> 00:15:01.009
the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:04.884
These initiatives cost less than a missile,

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:07.851
and certainly less than any soldier's life,

00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:10.706
but more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:13.004
and not onto our shore,

00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:14.448
and we're looking at the causes.

00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:17.897
The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.

00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:20.703
The advantages of dialogue are obvious.

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:25.005
It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,

00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:27.227
reveals the strengths and weaknesses,

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:29.828
and yes, like some of the speakers before,

00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:33.717
the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and

00:15:33.717 --> 00:15:36.622
it does then become, that process, part of normalization.

00:15:36.622 --> 00:15:41.295
But it's not an easy road. After the bomb,

00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:44.424
the victims are not into this.

00:15:44.424 --> 00:15:46.318
There's practical problems.

00:15:46.318 --> 00:15:49.214
It's politically risky for the protagonists

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.949
and for the interlocutors. On one occasion

00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:54.390
I was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.251
they actually threw stones at me,

00:15:56.251 --> 00:15:58.238
and when I did a point they liked,

00:15:58.238 --> 00:16:02.833
they starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)

00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:06.035
Whatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,

00:16:06.035 --> 00:16:08.151
you're doing it, you're talking to them.

00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:11.894
Now, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,

00:16:11.894 --> 00:16:17.256
we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to

00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:19.938
have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:23.687
military perception of it.

00:16:23.706 --> 00:16:26.163
We need to foster more

00:16:26.163 --> 00:16:28.948
modern and asymmetrical responses to it.

00:16:28.948 --> 00:16:31.503
This isn't about being soft on terrorism.

00:16:31.503 --> 00:16:35.223
It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.

00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:38.174
We must foster innovation, as I've said.

00:16:38.174 --> 00:16:42.046
Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.

00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:44.259
The private sector has a role.

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:46.832
The role we could do right now is going away

00:16:46.832 --> 00:16:50.557
and looking at how we can support victims around the world

00:16:50.557 --> 00:16:52.029
to bring initiatives.

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:54.832
If I was to leave you with some big questions here which

00:16:54.832 --> 00:16:58.307
may change one's perception to it, and who knows what

00:16:58.307 --> 00:17:00.686
thoughts and responses will come out of it,

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:04.641
but did myself and my terrorist group actually need

00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:07.877
to blow you up to make our point?

00:17:07.877 --> 00:17:12.259
We have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:15.393
Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian

00:17:15.393 --> 00:17:18.158
struggle somewhere in the world?

00:17:18.158 --> 00:17:20.808
What if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice

00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:23.223
is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?

00:17:23.223 --> 00:17:26.328
What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:29.527
What happens if that bomb went off

00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:32.834
because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:37.513
to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?

00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:40.680
What is definitely uncontroversial

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.487
is that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,

00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:46.104
and more proactive, and I just want to leave you

00:17:46.104 --> 00:17:49.512
with one idea, which is that

00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:52.672
it's a provocative question for you to think about,

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:56.793
and the answer will require sympathy with the devil.

00:17:56.793 --> 00:17:59.510
It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.427
and writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?

00:18:04.427 --> 00:18:08.730
What if society actually needs terrorism

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.273
to change and adapt for the better?

00:18:10.273 --> 00:18:14.824
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus

00:18:14.824 --> 00:18:18.028
and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:20.308
walking into the moonlight.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:23.156
What it would mean is that humans,

00:18:23.156 --> 00:18:25.812
in order to survive in development,

00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:27.887
quite Darwinian spirit here,

00:18:27.887 --> 00:18:32.217
inherently must dance with the devil.

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:36.476
A lot of people say that communism was defeated

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:40.470
by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.306
Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.

00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:45.893
Thank you.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:54.763
(Music) (Applause)

00:18:54.763 --> 00:18:57.341
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. (Applause)
