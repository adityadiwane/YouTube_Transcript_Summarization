00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:18.904
Do I look real to you?

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.341
Hope so.

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.600
I have no idea if you're seeing this,

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:27.043
but I'm just going to look ahead
and trust that you're there.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.566
I've drawn a semicircle
in the sand in front of me

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.945
so I don't walk past it
and look like I'm floating in midair.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.061
Right now I'm standing

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:42.283
in the open air,

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:44.172
on a beach under a palm tree,

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.615
in the exact spot
where your stage used to be.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.734
I have 12 minutes with you.

00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.043
I set a limit.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.005
My wife Navid once said

00:00:56.029 --> 00:01:00.030
that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.510
For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:06.887
that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo.

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:09.943
But we only had three days to make it,

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:11.671
and the only fabric we had

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:14.416
was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.915
But she did it, and it's perfect.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.677
And she looked at it and said,

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.334
"Proof of concept --
creation needs constraint."

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:30.168
So with these 12 minutes,

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:33.843
I'm going to tell you
about my greatest discovery.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:40.256
For my whole life, my obsession
has been eternal life,

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.391
as I know it is so many of yours.

00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:48.787
You may be happy to know
that your research will pay off.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.398
I am 318 years old.

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:57.257
The average human lifespan
is now 432 years,

00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:00.561
and my work has been to extend
the human lifespan indefinitely.

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:03.850
And I've never questioned that someday,

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.816
we'll reach a point
where we'll be content.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.565
But the opposite keeps happening:

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.063
the longer we live,
the longer we want to live,

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:14.715
the less we want to die.

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:17.310
Who can blame us?

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:21.441
The universe is so big.

00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:24.454
There won't ever not be more to see.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.629
Just yesterday,

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:28.413
I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:30.851
and sail from island to island
all over the planet,

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.108
and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit

00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:36.921
and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:40.992
And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.493
who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:45.857
And then there are others
where there's no one

00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:47.862
and there never has been,

00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:51.711
and so you go just for the pleasure
of touching your foot to sand

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.917
that no foot has ever touched before.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.870
You could spend 400 years doing just that.

00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:06.044
Right now the Moon is rising
in the Northeast.

00:03:07.013 --> 00:03:09.164
I can see the cities on it
with my naked eye.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.300
They're connected like nerve clusters:

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:17.825
Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator.

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:21.962
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.

00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:26.448
That's where Navid and I met.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.457
We were both artists downtown.

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:32.994
The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square,

00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:34.480
and we bumped shoulders.

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.255
And I turned to apologize

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:40.578
and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything,

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:44.140
said, "Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:50.339
And first of all, I thought,
"Who the hell are you?"

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.385
But second, the question annoyed me,

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.201
because the answer is so simple.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:57.308
I said, "We didn't pass through each other

00:03:57.332 --> 00:03:59.576
because elementary particles have mass

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.973
and because the space
between elementary particles

00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:05.369
is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass,

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.573
and we've known that for 800 years."

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.875
She must have been in one of those moods

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.787
where she likes to mess with strangers.

00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.700
Or maybe she was just flirting with me,

00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:19.095
because she looked at me and said,
"I thought you'd say that.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:21.787
Think deeper."

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.334
And then she took off her belt,

00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:26.861
this belt that I'm wearing now,

00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:29.583
and she said,

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:36.372
"Our universe is built
so that particles have mass.

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:40.270
Without that basic constraint,

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:43.777
we'd have just passed right through
each other at the speed of light

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:45.271
and never even known."

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:50.375
And that's how our romance began.

00:04:58.128 --> 00:04:59.588
Navid and I

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:03.731
never ran out of things to talk about.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.476
Never.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.252
It was incredible.

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:12.810
It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:15.289
and we kept arriving at new vistas,

00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:18.309
and these new, perfect
constellations of words

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.190
would come out of us to describe them.

00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:22.338
And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them,

00:05:22.362 --> 00:05:25.783
and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up.

00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:29.721
Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread,

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:33.264
and that we were always
adding in a little more flour

00:05:33.288 --> 00:05:34.737
and a little more water,

00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:36.714
and folding it in and turning it over

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:40.412
and never getting around to baking it.

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.018
If my obsession was eternal life,
Navid's obsession was touch.

00:05:50.772 --> 00:05:52.788
She had a genius for it.

00:05:53.502 --> 00:05:55.439
All of her work revolved around it.

00:05:57.383 --> 00:05:59.589
My body was like a canvas for her,

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:04.234
and she would draw her fingertip
down over my face so slowly

00:06:04.258 --> 00:06:06.241
that I couldn't feel it moving.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.938
And she was obsessed with the exact moment

00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:12.840
when I would stop being able to tell
the difference between her body and mine.

00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:18.716
Or she would just lie across me
and dig her shoulder into mine

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.631
and say, "Pilar, why does
this feel so good?"

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.592
I'd say, "I don't know!"

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.626
And she always had a facetious answer
for her facetious question,

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:35.597
but the answer I remember today is,

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.550
"It feels good

00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:41.354
because the universe chose
its constraints,

00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:42.663
and we are its art."

00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:56.702
It's always funny what you think
the future is going to be like

00:06:56.726 --> 00:06:58.296
versus what it turns out to be.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.273
In your time, scientists thought
humans could freeze themselves

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:04.629
and wake up in the future.

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:08.471
And they did -- but then they died.

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:14.843
In your time, scientists thought
humans could replace organs

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.120
and extend life for hundreds of years.

00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:19.657
And they did,

00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:21.683
but eventually, they died anyway.

00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:26.771
In your time, Earth
is the only place people live.

00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:33.211
In my time, Earth is the place
people come to die.

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:41.059
So when Navid started to show the signs,

00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:43.515
our friends assumed I would do
what everyone does,

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:45.674
which is say goodbye
and send her to Earth,

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:49.732
so that none of us
would have to look at her

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:53.492
or be around her
or think about her and her ...

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.858
failure to keep living.

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:01.995
More than anything,

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:04.796
they didn't want to be around
her actual physical body.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.824
They kept referring to it as "declining,"

00:08:08.536 --> 00:08:10.801
even though she herself
was fascinated by it,

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:12.948
the changes it was going through,

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:16.845
following the rules of its nature
day by day, independent of her will.

00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:22.051
I did send Navid to Earth.

00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:25.355
But I came with her.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.509
I remember a friend of ours,
just before we left, said,

00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:31.739
"I just think it's arrogant,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.953
like the rules don't apply to you,
like you think your love is that special."

00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:40.720
But I did.

00:08:44.468 --> 00:08:45.858
So, even here on Earth,

00:08:45.882 --> 00:08:48.579
I kept working on how to extend life.

00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:50.349
It didn't occur to me

00:08:50.373 --> 00:08:52.416
that there could be any other response.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.979
I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:56.742
that day in Azadi Square,

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:58.707
that without that basic constraint --

00:08:59.486 --> 00:09:01.762
a universe that granted mass to matter --

00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:03.183
we would not exist.

00:09:05.481 --> 00:09:06.652
That's one rule.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:10.564
Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:14.700
And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass.

00:09:14.724 --> 00:09:16.406
I know. I tried everything.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.569
I tried creating a photon box
where the Higgs field was altered.

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:25.175
I tried recording all
subatomic movements in my body

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.986
and replaying them on closed loop.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.191
Nothing worked.

00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:38.944
But my final innovation
was to create a coil dimension

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:43.299
with the boundaries of a body
in which time moved infinitely slower,

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:47.718
but whose projection would appear
to move in normal time.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.059
That body would then appear
in our universe as a hologram --

00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:56.604
here but not here.

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:02.521
When I realized I'd done it,

00:10:03.987 --> 00:10:05.843
I ran to her room,

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:08.061
so happy to tell her I'd done it,

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:11.696
moving through space
almost normally to all eyes,

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:13.704
even to my own,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.585
and went to lie down next to her,

00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:21.594
and forgot, and fell right through her.

00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:30.488
I'd found a way to eternal life,

00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:34.758
at the expense of the one thing
Navid loved most,

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:38.128
which was to touch and be touched.

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:43.286
And she threw me out.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.412
I still got to watch, though.

00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:53.480
Humans live 400 years now,

00:10:53.504 --> 00:10:54.882
and we still die.

00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:57.114
And when death comes,

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:01.597
the dying still pick at their bedsheets,

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:08.130
and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides,

00:11:08.154 --> 00:11:11.668
and their breaths get further
and further apart,

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:14.341
like they're falling asleep.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.034
I've always thought that

00:11:23.796 --> 00:11:25.890
what gives a life meaning is adventure.

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:29.869
And death is just a problem

00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:32.361
we haven't discovered the solution to yet.

00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.297
But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends.

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.544
Maybe that's the paradox:

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:45.419
constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom.

00:11:51.175 --> 00:11:52.435
(Sighs)

00:11:57.963 --> 00:11:59.987
There was a thunderstorm
here this morning.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.844
There is another forecast for tonight,

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:03.637
but for now the sky is clear.

00:12:04.937 --> 00:12:06.290
I can't feel the wind here,

00:12:06.314 --> 00:12:09.678
but I just asked one of the caretakers
who passed by what it felt like,

00:12:09.702 --> 00:12:12.845
and she said it felt warm,
like melted butter.
