00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.583
Where do you come from?

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:16.654
It's such a simple question,

00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:18.837
but these days, of course,
simple questions

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:21.883
bring ever more complicated answers.

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:24.835
People are always asking
me where I come from,

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.015
and they're expecting me to say India,

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.116
and they're absolutely right
insofar as 100 percent

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.682
of my blood and ancestry
does come from India.

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:38.747
Except, I've never lived
one day of my life there.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.155
I can't speak even one word

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.155
of its more than 22,000 dialects.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.365
So I don't think I've really
earned the right

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.811
to call myself an Indian.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:50.359
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.426
means "Where were you born
and raised and educated?"

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.852
then I'm entirely
of that funny little country

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:57.223
known as England,

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:59.634
except I left England
as soon as I completed

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.547
my undergraduate education,

00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.264
and all the time I was growing up,

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:06.060
I was the only kid in all my classes

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:09.189
who didn't begin to look
like the classic English heroes

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:11.867
represented in our textbooks.

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:13.169
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:13.193 --> 00:01:14.860
means "Where do you pay your taxes?

00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:17.408
Where do you see your doctor
and your dentist?"

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.771
then I'm very much of the United States,

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:22.339
and I have been for 48 years now,

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:24.427
since I was a really small child.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.135
Except, for many of those years,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.636
I've had to carry around this
funny little pink card

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.565
with green lines running through my face

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.178
identifying me as a permanent alien.

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:37.440
I do actually feel more alien
the longer I live there.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.627
(Laughter)

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.214
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:43.980
means "Which place goes deepest inside you

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.160
and where do you try
to spend most of your time?"

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:48.333
then I'm Japanese,

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.586
because I've been living as much as I can

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.971
for the last 25 years in Japan.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:57.024
Except, all of those years
I've been there on a tourist visa,

00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:59.166
and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.057
would want to consider me one of them.

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:05.308
And I say all this just to stress

00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:08.028
how very old-fashioned and straightforward

00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:09.027
my background is,

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:13.075
because when I go to Hong
Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.971
most of the kids I meet

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:18.770
are much more international
and multi-cultured than I am.

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:21.435
And they have one home
associated with their parents,

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.591
but another associated
with their partners,

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:27.980
a third connected maybe with the place
where they happen to be,

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.894
a fourth connected with the place
they dream of being,

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:33.238
and many more besides.

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:36.524
And their whole life will be
spent taking pieces

00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:40.011
of many different places
and putting them together

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.853
into a stained glass whole.

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:45.294
Home for them is really
a work in progress.

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:47.890
It's like a project
on which they're constantly adding

00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:51.024
upgrades and improvements and corrections.

00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:52.919
And for more and more of us,

00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:57.374
home has really less to do
with a piece of soil

00:02:57.398 --> 00:03:00.125
than, you could say, with a piece of soul.

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.530
If somebody suddenly asks
me, "Where's your home?"

00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:05.445
I think about my sweetheart
or my closest friends

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.712
or the songs that travel with me
wherever I happen to be.

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:11.569
And I'd always felt this way,

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:14.312
but it really came home to me, as it were,

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:17.030
some years ago when
I was climbing up the stairs

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.732
in my parents' house in California,

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:22.558
and I looked through the living
room windows

00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:27.736
and I saw that we were
encircled by 70-foot flames,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.222
one of those wildfires
that regularly tear through

00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:34.053
the hills of California
and many other such places.

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:37.078
And three hours later,
that fire had reduced

00:03:37.102 --> 00:03:39.822
my home and every last thing in it

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:42.840
except for me to ash.

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.550
And when I woke up the next morning,

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:47.241
I was sleeping on a friend's floor,

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.669
the only thing I had
in the world was a toothbrush

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:52.236
I had just bought
from an all-night supermarket.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.142
Of course, if anybody asked me then,

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.501
"Where is your home?"

00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:59.493
I literally couldn't point
to any physical construction.

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:04.225
My home would have to be whatever
I carried around inside me.

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.217
And in so many ways, I think
this is a terrific liberation.

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.411
Because when my grandparents were born,

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.938
they pretty much had their sense of home,

00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:16.430
their sense of community,
even their sense of enmity,

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:18.355
assigned to them at birth,

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.333
and didn't have much chance
of stepping outside of that.

00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:25.040
And nowadays, at least some of us
can choose our sense of home,

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:27.198
create our sense of community,

00:04:27.222 --> 00:04:30.779
fashion our sense of self, and in so doing

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.916
maybe step a little beyond

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.702
some of the black and white divisions

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:36.534
of our grandparents' age.

00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:38.418
No coincidence that the president

00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:41.149
of the strongest nation
on Earth is half-Kenyan,

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:42.756
partly raised in Indonesia,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.355
has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.819
The number of people living
in countries not their own

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:54.606
now comes to 220 million,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.220
and that's an almost unimaginable number,

00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:00.970
but it means that if you took
the whole population of Canada

00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:02.886
and the whole population of Australia

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.196
and then the whole population
of Australia again

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.838
and the whole population of Canada again

00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:09.521
and doubled that number,

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.688
you would still have
fewer people than belong

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.895
to this great floating tribe.

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.681
And the number of us who live outside

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:19.765
the old nation-state categories
is increasing so quickly,

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.395
by 64 million just in the last 12 years,

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.875
that soon there will be more
of us than there are Americans.

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.549
Already, we represent
the fifth-largest nation on Earth.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:34.405
And in fact, in Canada's largest
city, Toronto,

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:38.095
the average resident today
is what used to be called

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.187
a foreigner, somebody born
in a very different country.

00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.976
And I've always felt that the beauty
of being surrounded by the foreign

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.573
is that it slaps you awake.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.377
You can't take anything for granted.

00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:53.111
Travel, for me, is a little bit
like being in love,

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:57.168
because suddenly all your senses
are at the setting marked "on."

00:05:57.192 --> 00:06:01.169
Suddenly you're alert to the secret
patterns of the world.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:05.485
The real voyage of discovery,
as Marcel Proust famously said,

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.483
consists not in seeing new sights,

00:06:08.507 --> 00:06:10.853
but in looking with new eyes.

00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:12.819
And of course, once you have new eyes,

00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:15.256
even the old sights, even your home

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.933
become something different.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:20.751
Many of the people living
in countries not their own

00:06:20.775 --> 00:06:23.834
are refugees who never
wanted to leave home

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:26.550
and ache to go back home.

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:28.197
But for the fortunate among us,

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.478
I think the age of movement brings
exhilarating new possibilities.

00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:33.543
Certainly when I'm traveling,

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:35.857
especially to the major
cities of the world,

00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:37.982
the typical person I meet today

00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:42.527
will be, let's say, a half-Korean,
half-German young woman

00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:44.230
living in Paris.

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:47.288
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,

00:06:47.312 --> 00:06:50.502
half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:52.979
she recognizes him as kin.

00:06:53.003 --> 00:06:57.318
She realizes that she probably
has much more in common with him

00:06:57.342 --> 00:07:00.911
than with anybody entirely
of Korea or entirely of Germany.

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.669
So they become friends. They fall in love.

00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:05.947
They move to New York City.

00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:08.110
(Laughter)

00:07:08.134 --> 00:07:09.496
Or Edinburgh.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.770
And the little girl
who arises out of their union

00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:14.901
will of course be not Korean or German

00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:17.444
or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian

00:07:17.468 --> 00:07:19.549
or even American, but a wonderful

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:23.683
and constantly evolving
mix of all those places.

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:26.448
And potentially, everything about the way

00:07:26.472 --> 00:07:29.197
that young woman dreams about the world,

00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:32.243
writes about the world,
thinks about the world,

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:34.213
could be something different,

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.408
because it comes out of this
almost unprecedented

00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.381
blend of cultures.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:42.465
Where you come from now
is much less important

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:44.113
than where you're going.

00:07:44.137 --> 00:07:46.509
More and more of us
are rooted in the future

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:49.805
or the present tense
as much as in the past.

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:52.368
And home, we know, is not just the place

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:54.478
where you happen to be born.

00:07:54.502 --> 00:07:58.951
It's the place where you become yourself.

00:07:58.975 --> 00:08:01.373
And yet,

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.038
there is one great problem with movement,

00:08:04.062 --> 00:08:07.249
and that is that it's really
hard to get your bearings

00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:08.867
when you're in midair.

00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:12.153
Some years ago, I noticed
that I had accumulated

00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:15.675
one million miles
on United Airlines alone.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:17.725
You all know that crazy system,

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:21.453
six days in hell, you get
the seventh day free.

00:08:21.477 --> 00:08:24.959
(Laughter)

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:27.235
And I began to think that really,

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:30.514
movement was only as good
as the sense of stillness

00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:34.361
that you could bring to it
to put it into perspective.

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.215
And eight months
after my house burned down,

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:39.937
I ran into a friend who taught
at a local high school,

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:43.469
and he said, "I've got
the perfect place for you."

00:08:43.493 --> 00:08:45.477
"Really?" I said. I'm
always a bit skeptical

00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.955
when people say things like that.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:48.325
"No, honestly," he went on,

00:08:48.349 --> 00:08:50.171
"it's only three hours away by car,

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:51.785
and it's not very expensive,

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:55.365
and it's probably not like anywhere
you've stayed before."

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:59.564
"Hmm." I was beginning to get
slightly intrigued. "What is it?"

00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:02.343
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:05.925
"Well, actually
it's a Catholic hermitage."

00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:07.891
This was the wrong answer.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:10.438
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,

00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:15.036
so I had had enough hymnals
and crosses to last me a lifetime.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.307
Several lifetimes, actually.

00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:19.865
But my friend assured me
that he wasn't Catholic,

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:21.318
nor were most of his students,

00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:24.099
but he took his classes
there every spring.

00:09:24.123 --> 00:09:28.862
And as he had it,
even the most restless, distractible,

00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:32.896
testosterone-addled
15-year-old Californian boy

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.132
only had to spend three days in silence

00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:40.386
and something in him cooled
down and cleared out.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.695
He found himself.

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.434
And I thought, "Anything
that works for a 15-year-old boy

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:46.773
ought to work for me."

00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:50.383
So I got in my car,
and I drove three hours north

00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:51.859
along the coast,

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.419
and the roads grew emptier and narrower,

00:09:54.443 --> 00:09:57.183
and then I turned
onto an even narrower path,

00:09:57.207 --> 00:10:00.823
barely paved, that snaked for two miles

00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:03.346
up to the top of a mountain.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.185
And when I got out of my car,

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:08.555
the air was pulsing.

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:10.415
The whole place was absolutely silent,

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:13.875
but the silence wasn't
an absence of noise.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:17.916
It was really a presence of a kind
of energy or quickening.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.427
And at my feet was the great,
still blue plate

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.681
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:28.115
All around me were 800
acres of wild dry brush.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.901
And I went down to the room
in which I was to be sleeping.

00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:32.626
Small but eminently comfortable,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.835
it had a bed and a rocking chair

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:38.009
and a long desk and even longer
picture windows

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:42.298
looking out on a small,
private, walled garden,

00:10:42.322 --> 00:10:45.498
and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass

00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:48.490
running down to the sea.

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:51.659
And I sat down, and I began to write,

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:53.163
and write, and write,

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:56.776
even though I'd gone there
really to get away from my desk.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.270
And by the time I got up,
four hours had passed.

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.399
Night had fallen,

00:11:03.423 --> 00:11:08.155
and I went out under this great
overturned saltshaker of stars,

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:10.407
and I could see the tail lights of cars

00:11:10.431 --> 00:11:14.620
disappearing around the headlands
12 miles to the south.

00:11:14.644 --> 00:11:18.328
And it really seemed
like my concerns of the previous day

00:11:18.352 --> 00:11:20.278
vanishing.

00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:22.090
And the next day, when I woke up

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:25.558
in the absence of telephones
and TVs and laptops,

00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:29.711
the days seemed to stretch
for a thousand hours.

00:11:29.735 --> 00:11:33.410
It was really all the freedom
I know when I'm traveling,

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:38.024
but it also profoundly
felt like coming home.

00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:39.640
And I'm not a religious person,

00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:41.141
so I didn't go to the services.

00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:43.710
I didn't consult the monks for guidance.

00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:46.490
I just took walks along the monastery road

00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:48.839
and sent postcards to loved ones.

00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:50.673
I looked at the clouds,

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:54.998
and I did what is hardest
of all for me to do usually,

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:57.492
which is nothing at all.

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:59.800
And I started to go back to this place,

00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:03.368
and I noticed that I was doing
my most important work there

00:12:03.392 --> 00:12:06.899
invisibly just by sitting still,

00:12:06.923 --> 00:12:10.024
and certainly coming
to my most critical decisions

00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:12.306
the way I never could when I was racing

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.879
from the last email
to the next appointment.

00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:17.508
And I began to think that something in me

00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:19.497
had really been crying out for stillness,

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:21.045
but of course I couldn't hear it

00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:22.831
because I was running around so much.

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:25.484
I was like some crazy guy
who puts on a blindfold

00:12:25.508 --> 00:12:28.715
and then complains
that he can't see a thing.

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:31.256
And I thought back
to that wonderful phrase

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.628
I had learned as a boy from Seneca,

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:37.286
in which he says, "That man is poor

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.659
not who has little but who hankers
after more."

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:44.751
And, of course, I'm not suggesting

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.585
that anybody here go into a monastery.

00:12:46.609 --> 00:12:48.177
That's not the point.

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:51.895
But I do think
it's only by stopping movement

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:54.191
that you can see where to go.

00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:57.796
And it's only by stepping
out of your life and the world

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.365
that you can see what you
most deeply care about

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:03.771
and find a home.

00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:05.814
And I've noticed so many people now

00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:08.902
take conscious measures
to sit quietly for 30 minutes

00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:11.435
every morning just collecting themselves

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:13.995
in one corner of the room
without their devices,

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:16.068
or go running every evening,

00:13:16.092 --> 00:13:18.024
or leave their cell phones behind

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.941
when they go to have a long
conversation with a friend.

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:25.110
Movement is a fantastic privilege,

00:13:25.134 --> 00:13:28.467
and it allows us to do so
much that our grandparents

00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:30.588
could never have dreamed of doing.

00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:32.493
But movement, ultimately,

00:13:32.517 --> 00:13:37.034
only has a meaning if you
have a home to go back to.

00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:39.825
And home, in the end, is of course

00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:42.693
not just the place where you sleep.

00:13:42.717 --> 00:13:45.332
It's the place where you stand.

00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:46.789
Thank you.

00:13:46.813 --> 00:13:52.506
(Applause)
