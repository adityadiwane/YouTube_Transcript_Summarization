00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
How do you observe something you can't see?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in finding and studying black holes.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Because black holes are objects

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
whose pull of gravity is so intense

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that nothing can escape it, not even light,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
so you can't see it directly.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
So, my story today about black holes

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
is about one particular black hole.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm interested in finding whether or not

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
there is a really massive, what we like to call

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And the reason this is interesting is that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
it gives us an opportunity to prove

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
whether or not these exotic objects really exist.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And second, it gives us the opportunity

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to understand how these supermassive black holes

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
interact with their environment,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of the galaxies which they reside in.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
So, to begin with,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
we need to understand what a black hole is

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
so we can understand the proof of a black hole.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So, what is a black hole?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
the mass,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
the spin, and the charge.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
of the universe.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
for the proof of a black hole,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
is to think of it as an object

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
whose mass is confined to zero volume.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
an object that's supermassive,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
it has no finite size.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So, this is a little tricky.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And that's named after the guy who recognized

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
why it was such an important radius.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So why is it so important?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
It's important because it tells us

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
that any object can become a black hole.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
the auditorium can become a black hole

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
if you can figure out how to compress it down

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
At that point, what's going to happen?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
At that point gravity wins.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Gravity wins over all other known forces.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
And the object is forced to continue to collapse

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
to an infinitely small object.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And then it's a black hole.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
it would become a black hole,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
It depends only on the mass of the object.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So, if I were to take the sun

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
it would become a black hole.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And it's actually quite a useful concept,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
because it tells us not only

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
when a black hole will form,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I only need two things.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
I need to understand the mass of the object

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I'm claiming is a black hole,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and what its Schwarzschild radius is.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
there is actually only one thing I really need to know.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
So, my job in convincing you

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
that there is a black hole

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
is to show that there is some object

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And your job today is to be skeptical.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
of a really massive star's life.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So, if a star starts its life off

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
it's going to end its life by exploding

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And inside that supernova remnant

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
is going to be a little black hole

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
On an astronomical scale

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that's a very small black hole.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
There are big ones. There are little ones.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
just to give you a sense of scale.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
comes from the light from the stars.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
because they are kind of show offs.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
And we call them active galactic nuclei.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And we call them that because their nucleus,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
or their center, are very active.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
So, at the center there, that's actually where

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
most of the starlight comes out from.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And yet, what we actually see is light

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that can't be explained by the starlight.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It's way more energetic.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
There are also jets emanating out from the center.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So, what people have thought is that perhaps

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
there are supermassive black holes

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
which matter is falling on to.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
So, you can't see the black hole itself,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
into the light we see.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
exist at the center of galaxies.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
But it's a kind of indirect argument.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
that maybe it's not just these prima donnas

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that have these supermassive black holes,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
but rather all galaxies might harbor these

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
supermassive black holes at their centers.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
what we see is the star light.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And if there is a supermassive black hole,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
in active galactic nuclei.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
If we're going to look for these stealth black holes

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
at the center of galaxies,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And this is a wide field picture

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
taken of the center of the Milky Way.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And what we see is a line of stars.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
a flattened, disk-like structure.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
is 100 times further away.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
than anyplace else.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is key to this experiment.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
inside a small volume?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
Which is the job that I have to show you today.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And the tool that we use is to watch the way

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
stars orbit the black hole.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Stars will orbit the black hole

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
It's the gravitational pull

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that makes these things orbit.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
or at least go at a much slower rate

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
because all that determines how they go around

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
is how much mass is inside its orbit.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
So, this is great, because remember my job is to show

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
So, I want to see the stars

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
the world's largest telescope.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
the diameter of a tennis court.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Now, this is wonderful,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
because the campaign promise

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.260
the smaller the detail that we can see.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
And that is because of the atmosphere.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
to survive here on Earth.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So, to give you a sense of what this is like,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
it's actually like looking at a pebble

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
at the bottom of a stream.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Very much in the same way, it's very difficult

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
to see astronomical sources, because of the

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
atmosphere that's continuously moving by.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And that buys us about a factor of 20.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And I think all of you can agree that if you can

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.260
say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And this animation here shows you one example of

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
You're seeing an animation that goes between

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
where we think the black hole is.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So, without this technology you can't see the stars.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
This technology works by introducing a mirror

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
into the telescope optics system

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:18.260
that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.260
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
that little square there.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
although we've looked at all of them.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
So, I want to see how these things have moved.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
And over the course of this experiment, these stars

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
have moved a tremendous amount.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and we see the stars go all the way around.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And to give you a sense of how short that is,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.260
the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
as possible, take 500 years.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.260
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
That's kind of profound, in a way.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.260
how much mass is inside a very small radius.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
So, next we see a picture here that shows you

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
before this experiment the size to which we could

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
What we knew before is that there was four million

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
times the mass of the sun inside that circle.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
You can see a lot of stars.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So, there was actually lots of alternatives

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
because you could put a lot of stuff in there.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
But with this experiment, we've confined

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
that same mass to a much smaller volume

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
that's 10,000 times smaller.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And because of that, we've been able to show

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
To give you a sense of how small that size is,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
that's the size of our solar system.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
into that small volume.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Now, truth in advertising. Right?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
And the truth is, I'm not quite there.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
But we actually have no alternative today

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
to explaining this concentration of mass.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
for not only existence of a supermassive black hole

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
So, what next? I actually think

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
so let's move on with the problem.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
is a few examples

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
of the excitement of what we can do today

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
or at least we believe,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And the fun phase of this experiment

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
is, while we've tested some of our ideas

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
about the consequences of a supermassive black hole

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
being at the center of our galaxy,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
almost every single one

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
has been inconsistent with what we actually see.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
And that's the fun.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
So, let me give you the two examples.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
You can ask, "What do you expect

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
What you expect there is that old stars

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
should be very clustered around the black hole.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.260
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
they just should not be there.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.260
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.260
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And it's a very fragile entity.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And what does the big black hole do?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
It strips that gas cloud apart.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and the cloud is stripped apart.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
So, you shouldn't see young stars.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
So, what do we see?

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
The old ones are red.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
So, you can already see the surprise.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
There is a dearth of old stars.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.260
There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
So, this is the fun part.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
this mystery of how do you get --

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
how do you resolve this contradiction.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
So, in fact, my graduate students

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.260
are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
in Hawaii, making observations to get us

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
hopefully to the next stage,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
where we can address this question

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
of why are there so many young stars,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and so few old stars.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
of stars that are much further away.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
To do that we'll probably need much more

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
sophisticated technology than we have today.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
correct for half the errors that are introduced.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and what we think we can do is if we

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
shine a few more that we can correct the rest.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
And on a much longer time scale,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
And with this telescope we should be able to see

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
And we hope to be able to test some of

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
Einstein's theories of general relativity,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So, we think the future of this experiment

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
is quite exciting.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
that basically shows you how these

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And I hope, if nothing else,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And this means that these things do exist in our universe,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and we have to contend with this, we have to explain

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
how you can get these objects in our physical world.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
of how supermassive black holes interact,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and understand, maybe, the role in which they play

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And last but not least,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
none of this would have happened

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
without the advent of the tremendous progress

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
that's been made on the technology front.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and holds a lot in store for the future.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Thanks very much.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.260
(Applause)
