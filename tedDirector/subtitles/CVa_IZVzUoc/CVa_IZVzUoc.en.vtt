00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:15.684
Two twin domes,

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:19.138
two radically opposed design cultures.

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:22.749
One is made of thousands of steel parts,

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:25.549
the other of a single silk thread.

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:28.501
One is synthetic, the other organic.

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:31.213
One is imposed on the environment,

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:33.330
the other creates it.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.300
One is designed for nature,
the other is designed by her.

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:40.925
Michelangelo said that
when he looked at raw marble,

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.401
he saw a figure struggling to be free.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:47.547
The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.445
But living things are not chiseled.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.183
They grow.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.465
And in our smallest units of life,
our cells, we carry all the information

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.857
that's required for every other cell
to function and to replicate.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.384
Tools also have consequences.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:13.532
At least since the Industrial Revolution,
the world of design has been dominated

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.227
by the rigors of manufacturing
and mass production.

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:19.975
Assembly lines have dictated
a world made of parts,

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.591
framing the imagination
of designers and architects

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.719
who have been trained to think
about their objects as assemblies

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:29.117
of discrete parts with distinct functions.

00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:34.855
But you don't find homogenous
material assemblies in nature.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.688
Take human skin, for example.

00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:41.622
Our facial skins are thin
with large pores.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.082
Our back skins are thicker,
with small pores.

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.177
One acts mainly as filter,

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:49.965
the other mainly as barrier,

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.257
and yet it's the same skin:
no parts, no assemblies.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.646
It's a system that gradually
varies its functionality

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.351
by varying elasticity.

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:03.777
So here this is a split screen
to represent my split world view,

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:08.205
the split personality of every designer
and architect operating today

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.548
between the chisel and the gene,

00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:15.410
between machine and organism,
between assembly and growth,

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.972
between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.736
These two worldviews,
my left brain and right brain,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.405
analysis and synthesis, will play out
on the two screens behind me.

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:32.200
My work, at its simplest level,

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:34.959
is about uniting these two worldviews,

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:37.197
moving away from assembly

00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:40.259
and closer into growth.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.211
You're probably asking yourselves:

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:44.385
Why now?

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.547
Why was this not possible 10
or even five years ago?

00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.579
We live in a very special time in history,

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:54.675
a rare time,

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.278
a time when the confluence of four fields
is giving designers access to tools

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:01.552
we've never had access to before.

00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:05.069
These fields are computational design,

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:10.101
allowing us to design
complex forms with simple code;

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:14.159
additive manufacturing,
letting us produce parts

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:17.809
by adding material
rather than carving it out;

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:21.277
materials engineering, which lets us
design the behavior of materials

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.018
in high resolution;

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.899
and synthetic biology,

00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:28.999
enabling us to design new biological
functionality by editing DNA.

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.731
And at the intersection
of these four fields,

00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:33.468
my team and I create.

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:35.897
Please meet the minds and hands

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.317
of my students.

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:45.433
We design objects and products
and structures and tools across scales,

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.228
from the large-scale,

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:50.768
like this robotic arm
with an 80-foot diameter reach

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:54.926
with a vehicular base that will
one day soon print entire buildings,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.037
to nanoscale graphics made entirely
of genetically engineered microorganisms

00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.441
that glow in the dark.

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:03.445
Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.842
an archetype of ancient
Arabic architecture,

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:10.430
and created a screen where
every aperture is uniquely sized

00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:14.040
to shape the form of light and heat
moving through it.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.715
In our next project,

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.949
we explore the possibility
of creating a cape and skirt --

00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:23.163
this was for a Paris fashion show
with Iris van Herpen --

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:25.975
like a second skin
that are made of a single part,

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.049
stiff at the contours,
flexible around the waist.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:33.789
Together with my long-term
3D printing collaborator Stratasys,

00:04:33.813 --> 00:04:38.820
we 3D-printed this cape and skirt
with no seams between the cells,

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.840
and I'll show more objects like it.

00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:44.865
This helmet combines
stiff and soft materials

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.001
in 20-micron resolution.

00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:50.413
This is the resolution of a human hair.

00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.023
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.

00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:55.072
That designers have access

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:59.494
to such high-resolution
analytic and synthetic tools,

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:04.080
enables to design products that fit
not only the shape of our bodies,

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.612
but also the physiological
makeup of our tissues.

00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:10.453
Next, we designed an acoustic chair,

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.689
a chair that would be at once
structural, comfortable

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:16.037
and would also absorb sound.

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.975
Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I
turned to nature for inspiration,

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.684
and by designing this irregular
surface pattern,

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:26.079
it becomes sound-absorbent.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.559
We printed its surface
out of 44 different properties,

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:33.976
varying in rigidity, opacity and color,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.999
corresponding to pressure points
on the human body.

00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:42.015
Its surface, as in nature,
varies its functionality

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.666
not by adding another material
or another assembly,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.409
but by continuously and delicately
varying material property.

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:54.313
But is nature ideal?

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:58.288
Are there no parts in nature?

00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:04.456
I wasn't raised
in a religious Jewish home,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.636
but when I was young,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.057
my grandmother used to tell me
stories from the Hebrew Bible,

00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:13.086
and one of them stuck with me and came
to define much of what I care about.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.118
As she recounts:

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:18.085
"On the third day of Creation,
God commands the Earth

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:20.625
to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:23.876
For this first fruit tree,
there was to be no differentiation

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.270
between trunk, branches,
leaves and fruit.

00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:30.443
The whole tree was a fruit.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.448
Instead, the land grew trees
that have bark and stems and flowers.

00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:41.710
The land created a world made of parts.

00:06:42.514 --> 00:06:44.372
I often ask myself,

00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:48.689
"What would design be like
if objects were made of a single part?

00:06:49.412 --> 00:06:52.849
Would we return to a better
state of creation?"

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:56.954
So we looked for that biblical material,

00:06:56.978 --> 00:07:01.631
that fruit-bearing fruit tree
kind of material, and we found it.

00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:07.250
The second-most abundant biopolymer
on the planet is called chitin,

00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:10.975
and some 100 million tons of it
are produced every year

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.855
by organisms such as shrimps,
crabs, scorpions and butterflies.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.975
We thought if we could tune
its properties,

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.627
we could generate structures
that are multifunctional

00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:22.211
out of a single part.

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:23.979
So that's what we did.

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.992
We called Legal Seafood --

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.052
(Laughter)

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:30.933
we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,

00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:34.027
we grinded them
and we produced chitosan paste.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.547
By varying chemical concentrations,

00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:39.865
we were able to achieve
a wide array of properties --

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:41.666
from dark, stiff and opaque,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.006
to light, soft and transparent.

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:47.629
In order to print the structures
in large scale,

00:07:47.653 --> 00:07:52.080
we built a robotically controlled
extrusion system with multiple nozzles.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.548
The robot would vary
material properties on the fly

00:07:55.572 --> 00:08:00.675
and create these 12-foot-long structures
made of a single material,

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.441
100 percent recyclable.

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:06.139
When the parts are ready,
they're left to dry

00:08:06.163 --> 00:08:09.742
and find a form naturally
upon contact with air.

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:14.242
So why are we still
designing with plastics?

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:19.462
The air bubbles that were a byproduct
of the printing process

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:22.362
were used to contain
photosynthetic microorganisms

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:25.259
that first appeared on our planet
3.5 billion year ago,

00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:26.845
as we learned yesterday.

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.586
Together with our collaborators
at Harvard and MIT,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.363
we embedded bacteria
that were genetically engineered

00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:36.529
to rapidly capture carbon
from the atmosphere

00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:38.560
and convert it into sugar.

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:41.236
For the first time,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.226
we were able to generate structures
that would seamlessly transition

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.584
from beam to mesh,

00:08:48.608 --> 00:08:51.003
and if scaled even larger, to windows.

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.575
A fruit-bearing fruit tree.

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:57.312
Working with an ancient material,

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.975
one of the first lifeforms on the planet,

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:03.975
plenty of water and a little bit
of synthetic biology,

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:07.506
we were able to transform a structure
made of shrimp shells

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.097
into an architecture
that behaves like a tree.

00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:14.025
And here's the best part:

00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:15.996
for objects designed to biodegrade,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.931
put them in the sea,
and they will nourish marine life;

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.566
place them in soil,
and they will help grow a tree.

00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:28.432
The setting for our next exploration
using the same design principles

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:30.177
was the solar system.

00:09:30.693 --> 00:09:34.975
We looked for the possibility
of creating life-sustaining clothing

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:37.167
for interplanetary voyages.

00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:43.745
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria
and be able to control their flow.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:48.329
So like the periodic table, we came up
with our own table of the elements:

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:51.742
new lifeforms that
were computationally grown,

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:53.807
additively manufactured

00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:56.279
and biologically augmented.

00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:01.621
I like to think of synthetic biology
as liquid alchemy,

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:04.384
only instead of transmuting
precious metals,

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:08.147
you're synthesizing new biological
functionality inside very small channels.

00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:10.519
It's called microfluidics.

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:15.242
We 3D-printed our own channels
in order to control the flow

00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.630
of these liquid bacterial cultures.

00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:23.433
In our first piece of clothing,
we combined two microorganisms.

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.368
The first is cyanobacteria.

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:28.368
It lives in our oceans
and in freshwater ponds.

00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:32.315
And the second, E. coli, the bacterium
that inhabits the human gut.

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:36.435
One converts light into sugar,
the other consumes that sugar

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:39.808
and produces biofuels
useful for the built environment.

00:10:39.832 --> 00:10:44.319
Now, these two microorganisms
never interact in nature.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.201
In fact, they never met each other.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:49.404
They've been here,
engineered for the first time,

00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:52.784
to have a relationship
inside a piece of clothing.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.975
Think of it as evolution
not by natural selection,

00:10:56.999 --> 00:10:58.817
but evolution by design.

00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:01.714
In order to contain these relationships,

00:11:01.738 --> 00:11:05.843
we've created a single channel
that resembles the digestive tract,

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:10.369
that will help flow these bacteria
and alter their function along the way.

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:14.451
We then started growing
these channels on the human body,

00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:17.804
varying material properties
according to the desired functionality.

00:11:17.828 --> 00:11:22.358
Where we wanted more photosynthesis,
we would design more transparent channels.

00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:28.205
This wearable digestive system,
when it's stretched end to end,

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.293
spans 60 meters.

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:32.975
This is half the length
of a football field,

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:36.348
and 10 times as long
as our small intestines.

00:11:37.612 --> 00:11:40.320
And here it is for the first time
unveiled at TED --

00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:42.447
our first photosynthetic wearable,

00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:46.091
liquid channels glowing with life
inside a wearable clothing.

00:11:46.694 --> 00:11:47.822
(Applause)

00:11:47.846 --> 00:11:50.895
Thank you.

00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:55.847
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned
creatures, but only half made up."

00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.752
What if design could provide
that other half?

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:04.583
What if we could create structures
that would augment living matter?

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:09.468
What if we could create
personal microbiomes

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:13.367
that would scan our skins,
repair damaged tissue

00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.120
and sustain our bodies?

00:12:16.062 --> 00:12:18.975
Think of this as a form of edited biology.

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:22.975
This entire collection, Wanderers,
that was named after planets,

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:25.657
was not to me really about fashion per se,

00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:29.040
but it provided an opportunity
to speculate about the future

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:31.686
of our race on our planet and beyond,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.441
to combine scientific insight
with lots of mystery

00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:38.786
and to move away
from the age of the machine

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.286
to a new age of symbiosis
between our bodies,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.749
the microorganisms that we inhabit,

00:12:44.773 --> 00:12:46.701
our products and even our buildings.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:49.567
I call this material ecology.

00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:54.168
To do this, we always need
to return back to nature.

00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:58.997
By now, you know that a 3D printer
prints material in layers.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:01.671
You also know that nature doesn't.

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:05.682
It grows. It adds with sophistication.

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:08.666
This silkworm cocoon, for example,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.010
creates a highly
sophisticated architecture,

00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:14.835
a home inside which to metamorphisize.

00:13:14.859 --> 00:13:20.511
No additive manufacturing today gets even
close to this level of sophistication.

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:23.607
It does so by combining not two materials,

00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:26.940
but two proteins
in different concentrations.

00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:31.483
One acts as the structure,
the other is the glue, or the matrix,

00:13:31.507 --> 00:13:33.928
holding those fibers together.

00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:35.712
And this happens across scales.

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:39.449
The silkworm first attaches itself
to the environment --

00:13:39.473 --> 00:13:41.489
it creates a tensile structure --

00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:44.610
and it then starts spinning
a compressive cocoon.

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:48.530
Tension and compression,
the two forces of life,

00:13:48.554 --> 00:13:51.608
manifested in a single material.

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:56.548
In order to better understand
how this complex process works,

00:13:56.572 --> 00:13:58.759
we glued a tiny earth magnet

00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:01.782
to the head of a silkworm,
to the spinneret.

00:14:01.806 --> 00:14:04.754
We placed it inside a box
with magnetic sensors,

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:07.865
and that allowed us to create
this 3-dimensional point cloud

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:12.831
and visualize the complex architecture
of the silkworm cocoon.

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.390
However, when we placed
the silkworm on a flat patch,

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:19.152
not inside a box,

00:14:19.176 --> 00:14:22.367
we realized it would spin a flat cocoon

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.368
and it would still
healthily metamorphisize.

00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.766
So we started designing different
environments, different scaffolds,

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.525
and we discovered that
the shape, the composition,

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:36.262
the structure of the cocoon, was directly
informed by the environment.

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:41.219
Silkworms are often boiled to death
inside their cocoons,

00:14:41.243 --> 00:14:44.425
their silk unraveled and used
in the textile industry.

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:51.392
We realized that designing these templates
allowed us to give shape to raw silk

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:54.486
without boiling a single cocoon.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.193
(Applause)

00:14:58.217 --> 00:15:00.939
They would healthily metamorphisize,

00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:03.493
and we would be able
to create these things.

00:15:03.517 --> 00:15:06.624
So we scaled this process up
to architectural scale.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.301
We had a robot spin
the template out of silk,

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:12.005
and we placed it on our site.

00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:17.373
We knew silkworms migrated
toward darker and colder areas,

00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:20.717
so we used a sun path diagram
to reveal the distribution

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:22.890
of light and heat on our structure.

00:15:23.692 --> 00:15:26.202
We then created holes, or apertures,

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:29.975
that would lock in the rays
of light and heat,

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:33.714
distributing those silkworms
on the structure.

00:15:34.777 --> 00:15:37.150
We were ready to receive the caterpillars.

00:15:37.174 --> 00:15:40.893
We ordered 6,500 silkworms
from an online silk farm.

00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:45.959
And after four weeks of feeding,
they were ready to spin with us.

00:15:45.983 --> 00:15:49.515
We placed them carefully
at the bottom rim of the scaffold,

00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:53.975
and as they spin they pupate,
they mate, they lay eggs,

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:59.104
and life begins all over again --
just like us but much, much shorter.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.045
Bucky Fuller said that tension
is the great integrity,

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.692
and he was right.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:10.438
As they spin biological silk
over robotically spun silk,

00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:13.126
they give this entire
pavilion its integrity.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.000
And over two to three weeks,

00:16:15.024 --> 00:16:19.679
6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.

00:16:19.703 --> 00:16:23.376
In a curious symmetry, this is also
the length of the Silk Road.

00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:28.692
The moths, after they hatch,
produce 1.5 million eggs.

00:16:28.716 --> 00:16:32.830
This could be used for 250
additional pavilions for the future.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:36.704
So here they are, the two worldviews.

00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:40.495
One spins silk out of a robotic arm,

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.851
the other fills in the gaps.

00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:47.963
If the final frontier of design
is to breathe life into the products

00:16:47.987 --> 00:16:49.781
and the buildings around us,

00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:51.975
to form a two-material ecology,

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:55.603
then designers must unite
these two worldviews.

00:16:55.627 --> 00:16:59.404
Which brings us back, of course,
to the beginning.

00:17:00.121 --> 00:17:03.724
Here's to a new age of design,
a new age of creation,

00:17:03.748 --> 00:17:07.096
that takes us from
a nature-inspired design

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.975
to a design-inspired nature,

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:13.975
and that demands of us for the first time

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:18.142
that we mother nature.

00:17:18.793 --> 00:17:19.827
Thank you.

00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:26.847
(Applause)

00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.975
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:31.999
(Applause)
