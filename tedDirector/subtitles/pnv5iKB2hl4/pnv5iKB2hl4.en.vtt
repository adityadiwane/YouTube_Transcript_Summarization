00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:15.039
I know what you're thinking:

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:16.912
"Why does that guy get to sit down?"

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.073
That's because this is radio.

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:24.497
(Music)

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.470
I tell radio stories about design,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.269
and I report on all kinds of stories:

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:33.840
buildings and toothbrushes,
mascots and wayfinding and fonts.

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:37.849
My mission is to get people to engage
with the design that they care about

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:40.929
so they begin to pay attention
to all forms of design.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.595
When you decode the world
with design intent in mind,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.020
the world becomes kind of magical.

00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:50.341
Instead of seeing the broken things,

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.642
you see all the little bits of genius

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:57.146
that anonymous designers have sweated over
to make our lives better.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.481
And that's essentially
the definition of design:

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.615
making life better and providing joy.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.516
And few things give me greater joy

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.700
than a well-designed flag.

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:09.746
(Laughter)

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.033
Yeah!

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.255
(Applause)

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:15.757
Happy 50th anniversary
on your flag, Canada.

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:18.391
It is beautiful, gold standard.

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:19.748
Love it.

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:21.794
I'm kind of obsessed with flags.

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.306
Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.924
and people are like,
"I don't care about flags,"

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:31.270
and then we start talking
about flags, and trust me,

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:33.822
100 percent of people care about flags.

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:37.337
There's just something about them
that works on our emotions.

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:41.388
My family wrapped my Christmas presents
as flags this year,

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:48.168
including the blue gift bag
that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:50.477
I put this picture online,
and sure enough,

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:53.466
within the first few minutes,
someone left a comment that said,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.945
"You can take that Scottish Saltire
and shove it up your ass."

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.697
(Laughter)

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.019
See, people are passionate
about flags, you know?

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:02.337
That's the way it is.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.900
What I love about flags

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.195
is that once you understand
the design of flags,

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.789
what makes a good flag,
what makes a bad flag,

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:11.372
you can understand
the design of almost anything.

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.183
So what I'm going to do here is,

00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:16.743
I cracked open an episode
of my radio show,

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:19.837
"99% Invisible," and I'm going
to reconstruct it here on stage,

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.127
so when I press a button over here --

00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.026
Voice: S for Sound --

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.951
Roman Mars: It's going to make a sound,

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:29.040
and so whenever you hear a sound
or a voice or a piece of music,

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:30.751
it's because I pressed a button.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.855
Voice: Sound.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.161
RM: All right, got it? Here we go.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.185
Three, two.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.631
This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:48.945
(Music)

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.575
Narrator: The five basic
principles of flag design.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.105
Roman Mars: According to the North
American Vexillological Association.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.935
Vexillological.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.005
Ted Kaye: Vexillology
is the study of flags.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.461
RM: It's that extra "lol"
that makes it sound weird.

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:04.379
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:07.688
The flag should be so simple
that a child can draw it from memory.

00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:09.663
RM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.187
I didn't even know cities
had their own flags.

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.088
TK: Most larger cities do have flags.

00:03:14.112 --> 00:03:16.841
RM: Well, I didn't know that,
that's Ted Kaye, by the way.

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:18.040
TK: Hello.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.474
RM: He's a flag expert,
he's a totally awesome guy.

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:23.713
TK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited
a scholarly journal on flag studies,

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:26.711
and I am currently involved
with the Portland Flag Association

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:29.729
and the North American
Vexillological Association.

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:33.099
RM: Ted literally wrote
the book on flag design.

00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:34.651
Narrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag."

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:37.371
RM: It's more of a pamphlet, really,
it's about 16 pages.

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:41.304
TK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag:
How to Design a Great Flag."

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:44.023
RM: And that first city flag
I discovered in Chicago

00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:45.294
is a beaut:

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:48.843
white field, two horizontal blue stripes,

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:51.728
and four six-pointed red stars
down the middle.

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:53.290
(Sound)

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:55.575
Narrator: Number two,
use meaningful symbolism.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.651
TK: The blue stripes represent
the water, the river and the lake.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:00.879
Narrator: The flag's images,
colors or pattern

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:02.626
should relate to what it symbolizes.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.435
TK: The red stars represent
significant events in Chicago's history.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.163
RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn
on the future site of Chicago,

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:13.022
the Great Chicago Fire,

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:15.693
the World Columbian Exposition,
which everyone remembers

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.511
because of the White City,

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:21.951
and the Century of Progress Exposition,
which no one remembers at all.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.962
Narrator: Number three,
use two to three basic colors.

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:28.454
TK: The basic rule for colors
is to use two to three colors

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:33.452
from the standard color set:
red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:36.468
RM: The design of the Chicago flag
has complete buy-in

00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:38.459
with an entire cross-section of the city.

00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:39.651
It is everywhere;

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.239
every municipal building flies the flag.

00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:45.196
Whet Moser: There's probably
at least one store on every block

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.463
near where I work that sells
some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:50.894
RM: That's Whet Moser
from Chicago magazine.

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:53.911
WM: Today, just for example,
I went to get a haircut,

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:56.309
and when I sat down in the barber's chair,

00:04:56.333 --> 00:05:00.780
there was a Chicago flag on the box
that the barber kept all his tools in,

00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:04.263
and then in the mirror, there was
a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:09.255
When I left, a guy passed me who had
a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.342
RM: It's adaptable and remixable.

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:14.931
The six-pointed stars in particular
show up in all kinds of places.

00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:18.636
WM: The coffee I bought the other day
had a Chicago star on it.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.631
RM: It's a distinct symbol
of Chicago pride.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:25.352
TK: When a police officer
or a firefighter dies in Chicago,

00:05:25.376 --> 00:05:28.966
often it's not the flag
of the United States on his casket.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.888
It can be the flag of the city of Chicago.

00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:37.141
That's how deeply the flag has gotten
into the civic imagery of Chicago.

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:41.251
RM: And it isn't just that people
love Chicago and therefore love the flag.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:46.767
I also think that people love Chicago more
because the flag is so cool.

00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:51.631
TK: A positive feedback loop there
between great symbolism and civic pride.

00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:55.508
RM: OK, so when I moved back
to San Francisco in 2008,

00:05:55.532 --> 00:05:56.901
I researched its flag,

00:05:56.925 --> 00:06:02.003
because I had never seen it
in the previous eight years I lived there.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:04.911
And I found it, I am sorry to say,

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:06.593
sadly lacking.

00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:10.321
(Laughter)

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:11.495
I know.

00:06:12.528 --> 00:06:13.772
It hurts me, too.

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:16.619
(Laughter)

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.386
TK: Well, let me start from the top.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.196
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.396
TK: Keeping it simple.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.994
Narrator: The flag should be so simple
that a child can draw it from memory.

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:26.887
TK: It's a relatively complex flag.

00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:28.179
RM: OK, here we go, OK.

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:30.888
The main component
of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix

00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:33.121
representing the city
rising from the ashes

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:36.187
after the devastating fires of the 1850s.

00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:38.971
TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:40.970
RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.

00:06:40.994 --> 00:06:43.640
Design-wise, it manages
to both be too crude

00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:46.476
and have too many details
at the same time,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.191
which if you were trying for that,

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:50.132
you wouldn't be able to do it,

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:51.906
and it just looks bad at a distance,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.598
but having deep meaning
puts that element in the plus column.

00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:58.822
Behind the phoenix,
the background is mostly white,

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:02.151
and then it has a substantial
gold border around it.

00:07:02.175 --> 00:07:04.844
TK: Which is a very attractive
design element.

00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:06.593
RM: I think it's OK, but --

00:07:06.617 --> 00:07:08.176
(Laughter)

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.196
here come the big no-nos of flag design.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.617
Narrator: Number four,
no lettering or seals.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.877
Never use writing of any kind.

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.499
RM: Underneath the phoenix,
there's a motto on a ribbon

00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:21.478
that translates to
"Gold in peace, iron in war,"

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:23.833
plus -- and this is the big problem --

00:07:23.857 --> 00:07:27.066
it says San Francisco across the bottom.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.925
TK: If you need to write the name
of what you're representing on your flag,

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:32.725
your symbolism has failed.

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:34.525
(Laughter)

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:36.553
(Applause)

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:40.518
RM: The United States flag
doesn't say "USA" across the front.

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:43.699
In fact, country flags,
they tend to behave.

00:07:43.723 --> 00:07:47.010
Like, hats off to South Africa
and Turkey and Israel

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:49.162
and Somalia and Japan and Gambia.

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:51.704
There's a bunch
of really great country flags,

00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:55.959
but they obey good design principles
because the stakes are high.

00:07:55.983 --> 00:07:58.380
They're on the international stage.

00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:02.070
But city, state and regional flags
are another story.

00:08:03.058 --> 00:08:04.951
(Laughter)

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:07.707
There is a scourge of bad flags --

00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:08.776
(Laughter)

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.308
and they must be stopped.

00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:11.491
(Laughter)

00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:12.737
(Applause)

00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:16.361
That is the truth and that is the dare.

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:20.244
The first step is to recognize
that we have a problem.

00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:22.908
(Laughter)

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:27.309
A lot of people tend to think
that good design

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:28.670
is just a matter of taste,

00:08:28.694 --> 00:08:31.716
and quite honestly,
sometimes it is, actually,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.121
but sometimes it isn't, all right?

00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:35.295
(Laughter)

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:38.859
Here's the full list of NAVA
flag design principles.

00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:42.982
Narrator: The five
basic principles of flag design.

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:45.602
Narrator: Number one.
TK: Keep it simple.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.054
Narrator: Number two.
TK: Use meaningful symbolism.

00:08:48.078 --> 00:08:50.825
Narrator: Number three.
TK: Use two to three basic colors.

00:08:50.849 --> 00:08:53.145
Narrator: Number four.
TK: No lettering or seals.

00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:55.101
Narrator: Never use writing of any kind.

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.317
TK: Because you can't
read that at a distance.

00:08:57.341 --> 00:08:59.504
Narrator: Number five.
TK: And be distinctive.

00:08:59.528 --> 00:09:02.202
RM: All the best flags tend
to stick to these principles.

00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:04.576
And like I said before,
most country flags are OK.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.762
But here's the thing:

00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:09.278
if you showed this list of principles
to any designer of almost anything,

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:12.129
they would say these principles --
simplicity, deep meaning,

00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:14.883
having few colors
or being thoughtful about colors,

00:09:14.907 --> 00:09:17.159
uniqueness, don't have
writing you can't read --

00:09:17.183 --> 00:09:19.757
all those principles apply to them, too.

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:24.852
But sadly, good design principles
are rarely invoked in US city flags.

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:27.363
Our biggest problem
seems to be that fourth one.

00:09:27.387 --> 00:09:31.496
We just can't stop ourselves
from putting our names on our flags,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.391
or little municipal seals
with tiny writing on them.

00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:37.319
Here's the thing about municipal seals:

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:40.104
They were designed
to be on pieces of paper

00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:41.332
where you can read them,

00:09:41.356 --> 00:09:44.509
not on flags 100 feet away
flapping in the breeze.

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:46.404
So here's a bunch of flags again.

00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:49.616
Vexillologists call these SOBs:

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.058
Seals on a bedsheet --

00:09:51.082 --> 00:09:52.254
(Laughter)

00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:55.156
and if you can't tell
what city they go to,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.047
yeah, that's exactly the problem,

00:09:57.071 --> 00:10:00.019
except for Anaheim,
apparently, they fixed it.

00:10:00.043 --> 00:10:02.144
(Laughter)

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:05.541
These flags are everywhere in the US.

00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:07.734
The European equivalent
of the municipal seal

00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:09.504
is the city coat of arms ...

00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:13.549
and this is where we can learn
a lesson for how to do things right.

00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:15.750
So this is the city
coat of arms of Amsterdam.

00:10:15.774 --> 00:10:17.790
Now, if this were a United States city,

00:10:17.814 --> 00:10:20.038
the flag would probably look like this.

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:21.240
You know, yeah.

00:10:21.264 --> 00:10:22.497
(Laughter)

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.571
But instead, the flag of Amsterdam

00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:26.348
looks like this.

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:29.965
Rather than plopping
the whole coat of arms

00:10:29.989 --> 00:10:33.160
on a solid background and writing
"Amsterdam" below it,

00:10:33.184 --> 00:10:36.093
they just take the key elements
of the escutcheon, the shield,

00:10:36.117 --> 00:10:39.664
and they turn it into the most
badass city flag in the world.

00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:41.418
(Laughter)

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:45.624
(Applause)

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:48.006
And because it's so badass,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.739
those flags and crosses
are found throughout Amsterdam,

00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:53.193
just like Chicago, they're used.

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:56.868
Even though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags
are particularly painful

00:10:56.892 --> 00:10:58.137
and offensive to me,

00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.740
nothing can quite prepare you

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:03.845
for one of the biggest train wrecks
in vexillological history.

00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:05.113
(Laughter)

00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:06.287
Are you ready?

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:09.570
It's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:16.594
(Laughter)

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:21.435
I mean, it's distinctive,

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:23.304
I'll give them that.

00:11:24.114 --> 00:11:26.767
Steve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:28.070
RM: The city ran a contest

00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:31.489
and gathered a bunch of submissions
with all kinds of designs.

00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:35.720
SK: And an alderman
by the name of Fred Steffan

00:11:35.744 --> 00:11:42.051
cobbled together parts of the submissions
to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.045
RM: It's a kitchen sink flag.

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:47.881
There's a gigantic gear
representing industry,

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:50.156
there's a ship recognizing the port,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.689
a giant stalk of wheat

00:11:51.713 --> 00:11:53.779
paying homage to the brewing industry.

00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:55.493
It's a hot mess,

00:11:55.517 --> 00:12:00.344
and Steve Kodis, a graphic designer
from Milwaukee, wants to change it.

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:01.940
SK: It's really awful.

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:05.387
It's a misstep on the city's behalf,

00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:07.153
to say the least.

00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:10.035
RM: But what puts
the Milwaukee flag over the top,

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:12.139
almost to the point of self-parody,

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:17.641
is on it is a picture of the Civil War
battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.

00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:20.415
SK: So that's the final element in it

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.826
that just makes it
that much more ridiculous,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.525
that there is a flag design
within the Milwaukee flag.

00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:29.618
RM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:30.807
(Laughter)

00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:32.137
Yeah.

00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:33.869
(Music)

00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:36.284
Now, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.

00:12:36.308 --> 00:12:38.559
I've been there, I love it.

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.859
The most depressing part
of this flag, though,

00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:43.980
is that there have been
two major redesign contests.

00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:46.175
The last one was held in 2001.

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:48.749
105 entries were received.

00:12:48.773 --> 00:12:51.541
TK: But in the end, the members
of the Milwaukee Arts Board

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:55.094
decided that none of the new entries
were worthy of flying over the city.

00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:57.498
RM: They couldn't agree
to change that thing!

00:12:57.522 --> 00:12:58.751
(Laughter)

00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:00.837
That's discouraging enough
to make you think

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:04.260
that good design and democracy
just simply do not go together.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.438
(Laughter)

00:13:05.462 --> 00:13:08.291
But Steve Kotas is going
to try one more time

00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:10.477
to redesign the Milwaukee flag.

00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:13.149
SK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.

00:13:13.173 --> 00:13:15.826
Every great city deserves a great flag.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:18.551
RM: Steve isn't ready
to reveal his design yet.

00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:21.097
One of the things about
proposing one of these things

00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:22.793
is you have to get people on board,

00:13:22.817 --> 00:13:24.383
and then you reveal your design.

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:25.697
But here's the trick:

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.409
If you want to design a great flag,

00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:31.274
a kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's,
which also has a great flag,

00:13:31.298 --> 00:13:34.136
start by drawing
a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.504
on a piece of paper.

00:13:35.528 --> 00:13:38.026
Your design has to fit
within that tiny rectangle.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.264
Here's why.

00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:44.326
TK: A three-by-five-foot flag
on a pole 100 feet away

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:50.971
looks about the same size
as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:53.574
seen about 15 inches from your eye.

00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:57.735
You'd be surprised by how compelling
and simple the design can be

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.410
when you hold yourself to that limitation.

00:14:01.102 --> 00:14:03.862
RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.

00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:05.528
Is there anything we can do?

00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:10.647
TK: I like to say that in every bad flag
there's a good flag trying to get out.

00:14:10.671 --> 00:14:13.119
The way to make
San Francisco's flag a good flag

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:16.674
is to take the motto off
because you can't read that at a distance.

00:14:16.698 --> 00:14:18.202
Take the name off,

00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:22.459
and the border might even be made thicker,
so it's more a part of the flag.

00:14:22.483 --> 00:14:24.336
And I would simply take the phoenix

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.737
and make it a great big element
in the middle of the flag.

00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.582
RM: But the current phoenix,
that's got to go.

00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:34.012
TK: I would simplify
or stylize the phoenix.

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:36.271
Depict a big, wide-winged bird

00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:37.928
coming out of flames.

00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:39.755
Emphasize those flames.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.622
RM: So this San Francisco flag
was designed by Frank Chimero

00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:44.184
based on Ted Kaye's suggestions.

00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:47.067
I don't know what he would do
if we was completely unfettered

00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:48.775
and didn't follow those guidelines.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:52.065
Fans of my radio show and podcast,
heard me complain about bad flags.

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:54.012
They've sent me other suggested designs.

00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:55.795
This one's by Neil Mussett.

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:58.863
Both are so much better.

00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:00.315
(Laughter)

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:02.268
And I think if they were adopted,

00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.612
I would see them around the city.

00:15:05.135 --> 00:15:08.329
In my crusade to make
flags of the world more beautiful,

00:15:08.353 --> 00:15:10.449
many listeners have taken it
upon themselves

00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:12.959
to redesign their flags
and look into the feasibility

00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:15.015
of getting them officially adopted.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.292
(Music)

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.947
If you see your city flag and like it,

00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:20.189
fly it,

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:22.263
even if it violates a design rule or two.

00:15:22.287 --> 00:15:23.658
I don't care.

00:15:23.682 --> 00:15:25.842
But if you don't see your city flag,

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:29.036
maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.376
and it just sucks,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.007
and I dare you to join the effort
to try to change that.

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:38.459
As we move more and more into cities,

00:15:38.483 --> 00:15:43.378
the city flag will become
not just a symbol of that city as a place,

00:15:43.402 --> 00:15:49.685
but also, it could become a symbol
of how that city considers design itself,

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:52.934
especially today, as the populace
is becoming more design-aware.

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.966
And I think design awareness
is at an all-time high.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.021
A well-designed flag could be seen
as an indicator of how a city

00:16:00.045 --> 00:16:02.650
considers all of its design systems:

00:16:02.674 --> 00:16:04.282
its public transit,

00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:06.279
its parks, its signage.

00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:08.892
It might seem frivolous, but it's not.

00:16:09.857 --> 00:16:11.693
TK: Often when city leaders say,

00:16:11.717 --> 00:16:16.193
"We have more important things to do
than worry about a city flag,"

00:16:16.217 --> 00:16:17.816
my response is,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.420
"If you had a great city flag,

00:16:19.444 --> 00:16:22.160
you would have a banner
for people to rally under

00:16:22.184 --> 00:16:24.591
to face those more important things."

00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:26.931
(Music)

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:29.387
RM: I've seen firsthand
what a good city flag can do

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:30.700
in the case of Chicago.

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:33.311
The marriage of good design
and civic pride

00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:35.827
is something that we need in all places.

00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:39.703
The best part about municipal flags
is that we own them.

00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:41.278
They are an open-source,

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:44.967
publicly owned design language
of the community.

00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:46.384
When they are done well,

00:16:46.408 --> 00:16:50.653
they are remixable, adaptable,
and they are powerful.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.092
We could control the branding
and graphical imagery

00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:54.716
of our cities with a good flag,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.415
but instead, by having
bad flags we don't use,

00:16:57.439 --> 00:17:00.385
we cede that territory to sports teams

00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:02.812
and chambers of commerce
and tourism boards.

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:05.333
Sports teams can leave
and break our hearts.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:08.441
And besides, some of us
don't really care about sports.

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:11.142
And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.

00:17:11.725 --> 00:17:13.248
But a great city flag

00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:15.662
is something that represents
a city to its people

00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:17.845
and its people to the world at large.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.304
And when that flag is a beautiful thing,

00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:22.427
that connection is a beautiful thing.

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:26.697
So maybe all the city flags
can be as inspiring as Hong Kong

00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:28.873
or Portland or Trondheim,

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:30.880
and we can do away with all the bad flags

00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:34.803
like San Francisco, Milwaukee,
Cedar Rapids,

00:17:34.827 --> 00:17:37.466
and finally, when we're all done,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.305
we can do something
about Pocatello, Idaho,

00:17:40.329 --> 00:17:44.026
considered by the North American
Vexillological Association

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.449
as the worst city flag in North America.

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:49.346
[Proud to be Pocatello]

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.926
(Laughter)

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.872
(Applause)

00:17:55.896 --> 00:17:57.047
Yeah.

00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:58.221
(Applause)

00:17:58.372 --> 00:18:00.877

00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:02.916
(Laughter)

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.628
That hurts me just to look at.

00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:05.802
(Laughter)

00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:07.836
Thank you so much for listening.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.942
