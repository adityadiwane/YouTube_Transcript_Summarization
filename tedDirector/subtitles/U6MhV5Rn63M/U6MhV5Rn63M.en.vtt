00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:19.136
There are more Chinese
restaurants in this country

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.136
than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.797
40,000, actually.

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:28.149
Chinese restaurants have played
an important role in American history,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:29.352
as a matter of fact.

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:32.237
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved
in a Chinese restaurant

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.269
called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:35.927
which unfortunately is closed now,

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.816
and about to be turned into Walgreen's.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.651
And the house where John Wilkes Booth

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:41.953
planned the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln

00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:45.096
is also now a Chinese restaurant
called Wok and Roll,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.359
on H Street in Washington.

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:49.643
(Laughter)

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:51.338
And it's not completely gratuitous,

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:54.339
because "wok" and "roll" --
Chinese food and Japanese foods,

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:55.528
so it kind of works out.

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:57.774
And Americans love
their Chinese food so much,

00:00:57.798 --> 00:00:59.733
they've actually brought it into space.

00:00:59.757 --> 00:01:03.368
NASA, for example, serves
thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork

00:01:03.392 --> 00:01:05.544
on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:08.906
So, let me present the question to you:

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.554
If our benchmark
for Americanness is apple pie,

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:14.215
you should ask yourself:
how often do you eat apple pie,

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.215
versus how often do you eat Chinese food?

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:20.160
(Laughter)

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.631
And if you think about it,

00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:28.607
a lot of the foods that we or Americans
think of as Chinese food

00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.766
are barely recognizable to Chinese.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.829
For example: beef with broccoli,
egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:37.909
fortune cookies, chop suey,
the take-out boxes.

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.081
For example, I took a whole bunch
of fortune cookies back to China,

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.533
gave them to Chinese
to see how they would react.

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:44.824
[What is this?]

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:46.232
[Should I try it?]

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.016
[Try it!]

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.056
[What is this called?]

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.801
[Fortune cookie.]

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:57.523
(Laughter)

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.035
[There's a piece of paper inside!]

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:04.059
(Laughter)

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.730
[What is this?]

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:10.141
[You've won a prize!]

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:14.265
[What is this?]

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.248
[It's a fortune!]

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:20.893
[Tasty!]

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:23.321
So where are they from?

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.946
The short answer is, actually,
they're from Japan.

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:30.306
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still
small family-run bakeries

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.666
that make fortune cookies,
as they did over 100 years ago,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.840
30 years before fortune cookies
were introduced in the United States.

00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:39.487
If you see them side by side,

00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.790
there's yellow and brown.

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:43.504
Theirs are actually flavored
with miso and sesame paste,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:45.543
so they're not as sweet as our version.

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.160
So how did they get to the US?

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:50.136
Well, the short answer is,
the Japanese immigrants came over,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.618
and a bunch of the bakers
introduced them --

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.618
including at least one in Los Angeles,

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.135
and one here in San Francisco,
called Benkyodo,

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.305
which is on the corner
of Sutter and Buchanan.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.136
Back then, they made fortune cookies
using very much the similar kind of irons

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.909
that we saw back in Kyoto.

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:07.322
The interesting question is:

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:10.757
How do you go from fortune cookies
being something that is Japanese

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.504
to being something that is Chinese?

00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:15.651
Well, we locked up all the Japanese
during World War II,

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.744
including those that made fortune cookies.

00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:19.571
So that's when the Chinese moved in,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.531
saw a market opportunity and took over.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.181
(Laughter)

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:25.567
So, fortune cookies:
invented by the Japanese,

00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:26.902
popularized by the Chinese,

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.755
but ultimately consumed by Americans.

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.739
They're more American than anything else.

00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:32.204
Another of my favorite dishes:

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:35.385
General Tso's Chicken --
which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.937
is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:37.967
(Laughter)

00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.143
I love this dish.

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.228
The original name of my book
was "The Long March of General Tso."

00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:43.939
And he has marched very far indeed,

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:47.006
because he is sweet, he is fried,
and he is chicken --

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.788
all things that Americans love.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.471
(Laughter)

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.039
He has marched so far, actually,

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.228
that the chef who originally
invented the dish

00:03:54.252 --> 00:03:56.395
doesn't recognize it;
he's kind of horrified.

00:03:57.093 --> 00:03:59.093
Video: (In Chinese)

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.555
Audience: (Laughter)

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.136
He's in Taiwan right now.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.581
He's retired, deaf
and plays a lot of mah–jongg.

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.874
After I showed him this, he got up,

00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:17.891
and says, "mòmíngqímiào,"
which means, "This is all nonsense,"

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.866
and goes back to play his mah-jongg
game during the afternoon.

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:24.870
Another dish, one of my favorites:
beef with broccoli.

00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:28.056
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.801
in fact, it is originally
an Italian vegetable.

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.800
It was introduced into
the United States in the 1800s,

00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:36.701
but became popularized
in the 1920s and the 1930s.

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:40.174
The Chinese have their own version
of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,

00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:42.617
but they've now discovered
American broccoli,

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.526
and are importing it
as a sort of exotic delicacy.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.639
I guarantee you, General Tso
never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.

00:04:50.663 --> 00:04:52.866
That was a picture of General Tso.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.136
I went to his home town.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.613
This is a billboard that says:

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:57.653
"Welcome to the birthplace
of General Tso."

00:04:57.677 --> 00:04:59.872
And I went looking for chicken.

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.342
Finally found a cow --

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:04.112
and did find chicken.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.096
Believe it or not, these guys
were actually crossing the road.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.084
(Laughter)

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.252
And I found a whole bunch
of General Tso's relatives

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.561
who are still in the town.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.348
This guy is now five generations
removed from the General;

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:18.578
this guy is about seven.

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:21.428
I showed them the pictures
of General Tso Chicken,

00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:22.622
and they were like,

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:24.909
"We don't know this dish.
Is this Chinese food?"

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:27.360
Because it doesn't look
like Chinese food to them.

00:05:27.384 --> 00:05:31.640
But they weren't surprised I traveled
around the world to visit them,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.878
because in their eyes he is, after all,

00:05:33.902 --> 00:05:35.642
a famous Qing dynasty military hero.

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:38.160
He played an important role
in the Taiping Rebellion,

00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:40.808
a war started by a guy
who thought he was the son of God

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.422
and baby brother of Jesus Christ.

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:44.736
He caused a war that killed
20 million people --

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.013
still the deadliest civil war
in the world to this day.

00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:51.054
So, you know, I realized when I was there,

00:05:51.078 --> 00:05:54.055
General Tso is kind of a lot
like Colonel Sanders in America,

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.607
in that he's known
for chicken and not war.

00:05:56.631 --> 00:06:00.123
But in China, this guy's actually known
for war and not chicken.

00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:03.288
But the granddaddy
of all the Chinese American dishes

00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:06.232
we probably ought to talk
about is chop suey,

00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:09.374
which was introduced
around the turn of the 20th century.

00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:12.026
According to the New York Times in 1904,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.913
there was an outbreak
of Chinese restaurants all over town,

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.856
and "... the city has gone
'chop suey' mad."

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.573
So it took about 30 years
before the Americans realized

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:24.136
that chop suey is actually
not known in China,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.077
and as this article points out,

00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:30.688
"The average native of any city in China
knows nothing of chop suey."

00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:34.097
Back then it was a way to show
you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:37.792
a guy who wanted to impress a girl
could take her on a chop suey date.

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:40.269
I like to say chop suey
is the biggest culinary joke

00:06:40.293 --> 00:06:41.980
one culture ever played on another,

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.123
because "chop suey,"
translated into Chinese,

00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:47.263
means "jaahp-seui," which, translated
back, means "odds and ends."

00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:50.660
So, these people are going
around China asking for chop suey,

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:53.533
which is sort of like a Japanese guy
coming here and saying,

00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:56.301
"I understand you have
a very popular dish in your country

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:57.629
called 'leftovers.'"

00:06:57.653 --> 00:06:59.865
(Laughter)

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.040
Right?

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:03.216
(Laughter)

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.438
And not only that:

00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:07.105
"This dish is particularly popular

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:09.221
after that holiday
you call 'Thanksgiving.'"

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:10.247
(Laughter)

00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:13.353
So, why and where did chop suey come from?

00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:16.574
Let's go back to the mid-1800s,

00:07:16.598 --> 00:07:18.510
when the Chinese first came to America.

00:07:18.534 --> 00:07:21.941
Back then, Americans were not
clamoring to eat Chinese food.

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:26.608
In fact, they saw these people
who landed at their shores as alien.

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.694
These people weren't eating dogs,
they were eating cats.

00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:32.101
If they weren't eating cats,
they were eating rats.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.475
In fact, The New York Times,
my esteemed employer,

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:36.123
in 1883 ran an article that asked,

00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:37.298
"Do Chinese eat rats?"

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:41.672
Not the most PC question
to be asked today,

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:44.107
but if you look at the popular
imagery of the time,

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.547
not so outlandish.

00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:50.527
This is actually a real
advertisement for rat poison

00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:51.758
from the late 1800s.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:54.440
And if you see under the word
"Clears" -- very small --

00:07:54.464 --> 00:07:57.250
it says, "They must go,"
which refers not only to the rats,

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:59.251
but to the Chinese in their midst,

00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:02.328
because the way
that the food was perceived

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:05.424
was that these people who ate
foods different from us

00:08:05.448 --> 00:08:06.702
must be different from us.

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:10.104
Another way that you saw
this antipathy towards the Chinese

00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:11.617
is through documents like this.

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:13.312
This is in the Library of Congress.

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:15.399
It's a pamphlet published
by Samuel Gompers,

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:17.161
hero of our American labor movement.

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:19.792
It's called, "Some Reason
for Chinese Exclusion:

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:23.500
Meat versus Rice: American Manhood
against Asiatic Coolieism:

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:24.675
Which shall survive?"

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:26.476
And it basically made the argument

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.533
that Chinese men who ate rice

00:08:28.557 --> 00:08:30.939
would necessarily bring down
the standard of living

00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:32.748
for American men who ate meat.

00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:34.210
And as a matter of fact, then,

00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:37.334
this is one of the reasons
we must exclude them from this country.

00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:39.136
So, with sentiments like these,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.136
the Chinese Exclusion Act
was passed between 1882 and 1902,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.136
the only time in American history

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.068
when a group was specifically excluded

00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:52.503
for its national origin or ethnicity.

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:54.920
So in a way, because
the Chinese were attacked,

00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:58.093
chop suey was created
as a defense mechanism.

00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.136
Who came up with the idea of chop suey?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.458
There's a lot of different
mysteries and legends,

00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:03.955
but of the ones I've found,

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:06.884
the most interesting
is this article from 1904.

00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:08.199
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen

00:09:08.223 --> 00:09:10.430
shows up in Chinatown,
New York City, and says,

00:09:10.454 --> 00:09:12.421
"I want you all to stop making chop suey,

00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:15.975
because I am the original creator
and sole proprietor of chop suey.

00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:17.380
And the way he tells it,

00:09:17.404 --> 00:09:22.393
there was a famous Chinese
diplomat that showed up,

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.028
and he was told to make a dish
that looked very popular

00:09:25.052 --> 00:09:26.790
and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.

00:09:26.814 --> 00:09:29.486
And as he said --
we would never print this today --

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.257
but basically, the American man
has become very rich.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.552
Lem Sen: "I would've made this money, too,
but I spent all this time

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.869
looking for the American man
who stole my recipe.

00:09:38.893 --> 00:09:40.995
Now I've found him
and I want my recipe back,

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:43.146
and I want everyone
to stop making chop suey,

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.043
or pay me for the right to do the same.

00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:48.732
So it was an early exercise
of intellectual property rights.

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:52.136
The thing is, this idea
of Chinese-American food

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.264
doesn't exist only in America.

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:58.289
In fact, Chinese food
is the most pervasive food on the planet,

00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:01.288
served on all seven continents,
even Antarctica,

00:10:01.312 --> 00:10:04.268
because Monday night is Chinese
food night at McMurdo Station,

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:07.411
which is the main scientific
station in Antarctica.

00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.486
You see different varieties
of Chinese food.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.568
For example, there is French Chinese food,

00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:14.541
where they serve
salt and pepper frog legs.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:18.552
There is Italian Chinese food,
where they don't have fortune cookies,

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.864
so they serve fried gelato.

00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:22.662
My neighbor, Alessandra,
was shocked when I told her,

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:24.618
"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."

00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:28.648
She's like, "It's not? But they serve it
in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:32.362
(Laughter)

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:34.202
Even the Brits have their own version.

00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:36.477
This is a dish called
"crispy shredded beef,"

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:39.677
which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred,
and not a lot of beef.

00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:42.794
There is West Indian Chinese food,
there's Jamaican Chinese food,

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:45.896
Middle Eastern Chinese food,
Mauritian Chinese food.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.642
This is a dish called "Magic Bowl,"
that I discovered.

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.136
There's Indian Chinese food,
Korean Chinese food,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.644
Japanese Chinese food,

00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:56.637
where they take the bao, the little buns,
and make them into pizza versions.

00:10:56.661 --> 00:10:57.776
(Laughter)

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.977
And they totally randomly
take Chinese noodle dishes,

00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:02.209
and just ramenize them.

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:05.447
This is something that,
in the Chinese version, has no soup.

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:07.434
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.913
which should not be mixed
with Mexican Chinese food,

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.910
where they basically take things
and make it look like fajitas.

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:13.936
(Laughter)

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.020
And they have things
like risotto chop suey.

00:11:16.044 --> 00:11:18.116
My personal favorite
of all the restaurants

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.727
I've encountered around the world

00:11:19.751 --> 00:11:21.791
was this one in Brazil,
called "Kung Food."

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:25.426
(Laughter)

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.699
So, let's take a step back and understand

00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:31.295
what is to be appreciated in America.

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:36.578
McDonald's has garnered
a lot of attention, a lot of respect,

00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:42.152
for basically standardizing the menu,
decor and dining experience

00:11:42.176 --> 00:11:43.726
in post-World War II America.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.990
But you know what?

00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:48.154
They did so through a centralized
headquarters out of Illinois.

00:11:48.178 --> 00:11:51.390
Chinese restaurants have done largely
the same thing, I would argue,

00:11:51.414 --> 00:11:53.962
with the menu and the decor,
even the restaurant name,

00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:55.853
but without a centralized headquarters.

00:11:55.877 --> 00:11:58.218
So, this actually became very clear to me

00:11:58.242 --> 00:12:01.001
with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,

00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:04.136
where they expected, based
on the number of ticket sales they had,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.181
to have three or four
second-place winners,

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:08.425
people who match
five or six Powerball numbers.

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:11.088
Instead, they had 110,
and they were completely shocked.

00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:14.473
They looked all across the country
and discovered it couldn't be fraud,

00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:17.979
since it happened in different states,
across different computer systems.

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:21.368
Whatever it was, it caused people
to behave in a mass-synchronized way.

00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:25.493
So, OK, maybe it had to do
with the patterns on the pieces of paper,

00:12:25.517 --> 00:12:28.423
like it was a diamond, or diagonal.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:31.387
It wasn't that, so they're like,
OK, let's look at television.

00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:33.340
So they looked at an episode of "Lost."

00:12:33.364 --> 00:12:34.553
Now, I don't have a TV,

00:12:34.577 --> 00:12:36.779
which makes me a freak,
but very productive --

00:12:36.803 --> 00:12:38.930
(Laughter)

00:12:38.954 --> 00:12:42.847
And there's an episode of "Lost"
where one guy has a lucky number,

00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:45.569
but it's not a lucky number,
it's why he's on the island,

00:12:45.593 --> 00:12:47.834
but they looked
and the numbers did not match.

00:12:47.858 --> 00:12:51.056
They looked at "The Young
and The Restless." It wasn't that, either.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.365
It wasn't until the first guy shows up
the next day and they ask him,

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:55.918
"Where did you get your number?"

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.947
He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."

00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:59.791
This is a slip one of the winners had,

00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:02.151
because the Tennessee
lottery security officials

00:13:02.175 --> 00:13:04.096
were like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.283
But it was true.

00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:08.136
Basically, of those 110 people,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.445
104 of them or so had gotten
their number from a fortune cookie.

00:13:11.469 --> 00:13:13.272
(Laughter)

00:13:13.296 --> 00:13:16.138
Yeah. So I went and started looking.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:18.782
I went across the country,
looking for these restaurants

00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:21.734
where these people had gotten
their fortune cookies from.

00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:25.397
There are a bunch of them,
including Lee's China in Omaha --

00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:28.202
which is actually run by Koreans,
but that's another point,

00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:30.783
and a bunch of them named "China Buffet."

00:13:30.807 --> 00:13:34.136
What's interesting is that their stories
were similar, but different.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.136
It was lunch, it was take-out,
it was sit-down, it was buffet,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.417
it was three weeks ago,
it was three months ago.

00:13:39.441 --> 00:13:42.561
But at some point, all these people
had a very similar experience

00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:45.449
that converged at a fortune cookie
and a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:48.069
And all these restaurants
were serving fortune cookies,

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:50.539
which, of course,
aren't even Chinese to begin with.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:54.103
It's part of the phenomenon
I called "spontaneous self-organization,"

00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:59.975
where, like in ant colonies,
little decisions made on the micro level

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:02.285
actually have a big impact
on the macro level.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:06.702
A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:10.263
McDonald's actually spent 10 years
coming out with a chicken-like product.

00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:14.573
They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken,
and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:18.602
And the great innovation of Chicken
McNuggets was not nuggifying them,

00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:20.124
that's kind of an easy concept.

00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:23.923
The trick was, they were able
to remove the chicken from the bone

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.235
in a cost-efficient manner,

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:28.318
which is why it took so long
for people to copy them -- 10 years,

00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:30.538
then within a couple months,
it was such a hit,

00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:33.853
they introduced it across the entire
McDonald's system in the country.

00:14:33.877 --> 00:14:35.643
In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.430
which actually started
in New York City in the early 1970s,

00:14:38.454 --> 00:14:41.989
as I was also started in this universe
in New York City in the early 1970s.

00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:43.015
(Laughter)

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:44.190
And this logo!

00:14:44.214 --> 00:14:47.465
So me, General Tso's Chicken
and this logo are all karmicly related.

00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:50.457
But that dish also took about 10 years
to spread across America

00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:52.160
from a restaurant in New York City.

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:54.958
Someone's like, "It's sweet,
it's fried, it's chicken --

00:14:54.982 --> 00:14:56.355
Americans will love this."

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:00.335
So what I like to say,
this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:04.502
is that we think of McDonald's as sort
of the Microsoft of dining experiences.

00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:07.282
We can think of Chinese
restaurants perhaps as Linux,

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.552
sort of an open-source thing, right?

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:10.578
(Laughter)

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:14.247
Where ideas from one person
can be copied and propagated

00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.492
across the entire system,

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:19.363
that there can be specialized
versions of Chinese food,

00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:20.538
depending on the region.

00:15:20.562 --> 00:15:24.160
For example, in New Orleans
we have Cajun Chinese food,

00:15:24.184 --> 00:15:27.954
where they serve Sichuan alligator
and sweet and sour crawfish.

00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:31.239
And in Philadelphia,
you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:34.602
which is like an egg roll on the outside
and cheesesteak on the inside.

00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:38.352
I was surprised to discover that not only
in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:39.527
What had happened was,

00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:44.114
a Chinese family had moved
from Philadelphia to Atlanta,

00:15:44.138 --> 00:15:45.765
and brought that with them.

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:47.486
So the thing is,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.298
our historical lore,
because of the way we like narratives,

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:53.351
is full of vast characters,
such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:55.631
and Ray Kroc with McDonald's

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:58.136
and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.283
But, you know, it's very easy
to overlook the smaller characters.

00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.991
For example, Lem Sen,
who introduced chop suey,

00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:07.392
Chef Peng, who introduced
General Tso's Chicken,

00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:11.136
and all the Japanese bakers
who introduced fortune cookies.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.937
So, the point of my presentation
is to make you think twice;

00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:17.399
that those whose names
are forgotten in history

00:16:17.423 --> 00:16:19.510
can often have had as much, if not more,

00:16:19.534 --> 00:16:21.429
impact on what we eat today.

00:16:21.453 --> 00:16:22.604
Thank you very much.

00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:28.779
(Applause)
