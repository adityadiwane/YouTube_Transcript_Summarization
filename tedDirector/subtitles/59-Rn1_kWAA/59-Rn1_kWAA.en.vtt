00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:20.580
I want you to imagine two couples
in the middle of 1979

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:23.873
on the exact same day,
at the exact same moment,

00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:26.179
each conceiving a baby, OK?

00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:28.457
So two couples each conceiving one baby.

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.747
Now I don't want you to spend too
much time imagining the conception,

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.627
because if you do,
you're not going to listen to me,

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.462
so just imagine that for a moment.

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.660
And in this scenario,
I want to imagine that, in one case,

00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:42.852
the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.907
meeting that X chromosome of the egg.

00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.103
And in the other case,
the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.394
meeting the X chromosome of the egg.

00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:52.469
Both are viable; both take off.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.055
We'll come back to these people later.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.482
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:02.333
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.

00:01:02.357 --> 00:01:06.236
I'm a historian by training,
and what I study in that case

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.846
is the way that people
have dealt with anatomy --

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.500
meaning human bodies, animal bodies --

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:14.236
how they dealt with bodily fluids,
concepts of bodies;

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.236
how have they thought about bodies.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.949
The other hat that I've worn
in my work is as an activist,

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:22.829
as a patient advocate --

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:25.236
or, as I sometimes say,
as an impatient advocate --

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.497
for people who are patients of doctors.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.236
In that case, what I've worked with
is people who have body types

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.175
that challenge social norms.

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:35.356
So some of what
I've worked on, for example,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.427
is people who are conjoined twins --

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:38.954
two people within one body.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.220
Some of what I've worked on
is people who have dwarfism --

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:44.528
so people who are much
shorter than typical.

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:48.574
And a lot of what I've worked on
is people who have atypical sex --

00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:52.626
so people who don't have the standard male
or the standard female body types.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.236
And as a general term,
we can use the term "intersex" for this.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.798
Intersex comes
in a lot of different forms.

00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:02.236
I'll just give you a few examples
of the types of ways you can have sex

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.593
that isn't standard for male or female.

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:06.236
So in one instance,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.696
you can have somebody
who has an XY chromosomal basis,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.236
and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.664
tells the proto-gonads,
which we all have in the fetal life,

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:16.872
to become testes.

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:20.018
So in the fetal life,
those testes are pumping out testosterone.

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:25.225
But because this individual
lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.329
the body doesn't react
to the testosterone.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:30.413
And this is a syndrome called
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:33.814
So lots of levels of testosterone,
but no reaction to it.

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:37.740
As a consequence, the body develops
more along the female typical path.

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:40.042
When the child is born,
she looks like a girl.

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.164
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:47.734
And it's often not until she hits puberty
and she's growing and developing breasts,

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:49.337
but she's not getting her period,

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:51.525
that somebody figures
out something's up here.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.318
And they do some tests and figure out

00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:55.819
that, instead of having
ovaries inside and a uterus,

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.289
she has testes inside,
and she has a Y chromosome.

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:00.004
Now what's important to understand

00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:02.516
is you may think of this
person as really being male,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.768
but they're really not.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.856
Females, like males,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.535
have in our bodies something
called the adrenal glands.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.116
They're in the back of our body.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.570
And the adrenal glands make androgens,
which are a masculinizing hormone.

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:16.695
Most females like me --
I believe myself to be a typical female --

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.878
I don't actually know
my chromosomal make-up,

00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:20.587
but I think I'm probably typical --

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:23.093
most females like me
are actually androgen-sensitive.

00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:25.838
We're making androgen,
and we're responding to androgens.

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:27.951
The consequence is that somebody like me

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.994
has actually had a brain
exposed to more androgens

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:34.400
than the woman born with testes
who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:35.946
So sex is really complicated --

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.614
it's not just that intersex people

00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:39.715
are in the middle
of all the sex spectrum --

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.836
in some ways,
they can be all over the place.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.018
Another example:

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:45.947
a few years ago I got a call
from a man who was 19 years old,

00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:47.834
who was born a boy, raised a boy,

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:50.443
had a girlfriend,
had sex with his girlfriend,

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:52.139
had a life as a guy,

00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:55.260
and had just found out
that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.541
What he had was an extreme form

00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:00.246
of a condition called
congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.196
He had XX chromosomes,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.959
and in the womb, his adrenal glands
were in such high gear

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:09.601
that it created, essentially,
a masculine hormonal environment.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.163
And as a consequence,
his genitals were masculinized,

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:15.699
his brain was subject to the more typical
masculine component of hormones.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.960
And he was born looking like a boy --
nobody suspected anything.

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:21.695
And it was only when he had
reached the age of 19

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.310
that he began to have enough medical
problems from menstruating internally,

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:28.706
that doctors figured out that, in fact,
he was female, internally.

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:32.728
OK, so just one more quick example
of a way you can have intersex.

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:36.631
Some people who have XX chromosomes
develop what are called ovotestis,

00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:40.394
which is when you have ovarian tissue
with testicular tissue wrapped around it.

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:42.544
And we're not exactly sure
why that happens.

00:04:42.568 --> 00:04:45.391
So sex can come
in lots of different varieties.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:50.262
The reason that children
with these kinds of bodies --

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:53.053
whether it's dwarfism,
or it's conjoined twinning,

00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:54.403
or it's an intersex type --

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.808
are often "normalized" by surgeons

00:04:56.832 --> 00:05:00.872
is not because it actually leaves them
better off in terms of physical health.

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:03.878
In many cases, people are actually
perfectly healthy.

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.944
The reason they're often subject
to various kinds of surgeries

00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:09.789
is because they threaten
our social categories.

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:12.582
Our system has been based
typically on the idea

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:15.936
that a particular kind of anatomy
comes with a particular identity.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.563
So we have the concept
that what it means to be a woman

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:19.979
is to have a female identity;

00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:24.236
what it means to be a black person
is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.819
in terms of your history.

00:05:26.377 --> 00:05:30.156
And so we have
this terribly simplistic idea.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.813
And when we're faced with a body

00:05:31.837 --> 00:05:34.771
that actually presents us
something quite different,

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:37.589
it startles us in terms
of those categorizations.

00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:41.554
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas
in our culture about individualism.

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:45.219
And our nation's really founded on
a very romantic concept of individualism.

00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:47.148
You can imagine how startling then it is

00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:51.002
when you have children who are born
who are two people inside of one body.

00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:55.534
Where I ran into the most heat
from this most recently

00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:58.429
was last year when South African runner,
Caster Semenya,

00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:02.008
had her sex called into question
at the International Games in Berlin.

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:04.856
I had a lot of journalists
calling me, asking me,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.754
"Which is the test they're going to run

00:06:06.778 --> 00:06:10.236
that will tell us whether or not
Caster Semenya is male or female?"

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.553
And I had to explain to the journalists
there isn't such a test.

00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:17.428
In fact, we now know
that sex is complicated enough

00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:19.186
that we have to admit:

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.899
Nature doesn't draw the line
for us between male and female,

00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:25.832
or between male and intersex
and female and intersex;

00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:27.931
we actually draw that line on nature.

00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:33.119
So what we have is a sort of situation
where the farther our science goes,

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.079
the more we have to admit to ourselves
that these categories

00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:38.790
that we thought of as stable
anatomical categories,

00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:42.481
that mapped very simply
to stable identity categories

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.640
are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.

00:06:44.664 --> 00:06:46.617
And it's not just in terms of sex.

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:48.236
It's also in terms of race,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.676
which turns out to be
vastly more complicated

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.792
than our terminology has allowed.

00:06:52.816 --> 00:06:55.908
As we look, we get into all sorts
of uncomfortable areas.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.761
We look, for example, about the fact

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:02.097
that we share at least 95 percent
of our DNA with chimpanzees.

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.821
What are we to make of the fact

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:07.312
that we differ from them
only, really, by a few nucleotides?

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:09.779
And as we get farther
and farther with our science,

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:11.992
we get more and more
into a discomforted zone,

00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:15.301
where we have to acknowledge
that the simplistic categories we've had

00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:17.423
are probably overly simplistic.

00:07:17.923 --> 00:07:21.534
So we're seeing this
in all sorts of places in human life.

00:07:21.558 --> 00:07:23.763
One of the places
we're seeing it, for example,

00:07:23.787 --> 00:07:25.801
in our culture,
in the United States today,

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:28.604
is battles over the beginning
of life and the end of life.

00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:30.236
We have difficult conversations

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.399
about at what point we decide
a body becomes a human,

00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:36.388
such that it has a different
right than a fetal life.

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:38.936
We have very difficult
conversations nowadays --

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.709
probably not out in the open
as much as within medicine --

00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:43.982
about the question
of when somebody's dead.

00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:46.633
In the past, our ancestors
never had to struggle so much

00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:48.759
with this question
of when somebody was dead.

00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:51.175
At most, they'd stick
a feather on somebody's nose,

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.343
and if it twitched,
they didn't bury them yet.

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:55.226
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.686
But today, we have a situation

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.021
where we want to take
vital organs out of beings

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.629
and give them to other beings.

00:08:00.653 --> 00:08:02.112
And as a consequence,

00:08:02.136 --> 00:08:04.740
we have to struggle
with this really difficult question

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:06.399
about who's dead,

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:08.768
and this leads us
to a really difficult situation

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:11.768
where we don't have such simple
categories as we've had before.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.903
Now you might think that all this
breaking-down of categories

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.913
would make somebody like me really happy.

00:08:16.937 --> 00:08:19.989
I'm a political progressive,
I defend people with unusual bodies,

00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:22.448
but I have to admit to you
that it makes me nervous.

00:08:22.472 --> 00:08:24.162
Understanding that these categories

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:27.279
are really much more unstable
than we thought makes me tense.

00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:30.556
It makes me tense from the point of view
of thinking about democracy.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.736
So in order to tell you
about that tension,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.877
I have to first admit to you
a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:38.510
I know they were racists,
I know they were sexist,

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:39.707
but they were great.

00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:44.845
I mean, they were so brave and so bold
and so radical in what they did,

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:49.339
that I find myself watching that cheesy
musical "1776" every few years,

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.367
and it's not because of the music,
which is totally forgettable.

00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:55.729
It's because of what happened in 1776
with the Founding Fathers.

00:08:55.753 --> 00:08:58.027
The Founding Fathers were,
for my point of view,

00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.103
the original anatomical activists,

00:09:00.127 --> 00:09:01.732
and this is why.

00:09:01.756 --> 00:09:05.031
What they rejected
was an anatomical concept

00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:06.591
and replaced it with another one

00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:09.944
that was radical and beautiful
and held us for 200 years.

00:09:09.968 --> 00:09:11.690
So as you all recall,

00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:15.118
what our Founding Fathers were
rejecting was a concept of monarchy,

00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:18.780
and the monarchy was basically based
on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.

00:09:18.804 --> 00:09:22.443
The monarchs of the old world
didn't have a concept of DNA,

00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:24.600
but they did have a concept of birthright.

00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:26.296
They had a concept of blue blood.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.503
They had the idea that the people
who would be in political power

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.704
should be in political power
because of the blood being passed down

00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:36.402
from grandfather to father
to son and so forth.

00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:39.422
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:42.097
and they replaced it
with a new anatomical concept,

00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.954
and that concept
was "all men are created equal."

00:09:45.978 --> 00:09:49.341
They leveled that playing field
and decided the anatomy that mattered

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:53.779
was the commonality of anatomy,
not the difference in anatomy,

00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:56.347
and that was a really radical thing to do.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.272
Now they were doing it in part

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.588
because they were part
of an Enlightenment system

00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:02.621
where two things were growing up together.

00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:04.913
And that was democracy growing up,

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:08.002
but it was also science
growing up at the same time.

00:10:08.026 --> 00:10:11.505
And it's really clear, if you look
at the history of the Founding Fathers,

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:13.815
a lot of them were very
interested in science,

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.867
and they were interested
in the concept of a naturalistic world.

00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:19.377
They were moving away
from supernatural explanations,

00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:22.638
and they were rejecting things
like a supernatural concept of power,

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:26.717
where it transmitted because
of a very vague concept of birthright.

00:10:26.741 --> 00:10:29.023
They were moving
towards a naturalistic concept.

00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:32.102
And if you look, for example,
in the Declaration of Independence,

00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:34.832
they talk about nature and nature's God.

00:10:34.856 --> 00:10:37.045
They don't talk about God
and God's nature.

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:40.972
They're talking about the power of nature
to tell us who we are.

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:44.236
So as part of that,
they were coming to us with a concept

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.970
that was about anatomical commonality.

00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:50.123
And in doing so, they were really
setting up in a beautiful way

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:52.060
the Civil Rights Movement of the future.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:55.625
They didn't think of it that way,
but they did it for us, and it was great.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:57.292
So what happened years afterwards?

00:10:57.316 --> 00:11:00.758
What happened was women, for example,
who wanted the right to vote,

00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:04.144
took the Founding Fathers' concept
of anatomical commonality

00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:06.375
being more important
than anatomical difference

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.933
and said, "The fact that we have
a uterus and ovaries

00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:11.720
is not significant enough
in terms of a difference

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:14.033
to mean that we shouldn't
have the right to vote,

00:11:14.057 --> 00:11:17.739
the right to full citizenship,
the right to own property, etc."

00:11:17.763 --> 00:11:19.815
And women successfully argued that.

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:22.236
Next came the successful
Civil Rights Movement,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.379
where we found people like Sojourner Truth

00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:26.672
talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"

00:11:26.696 --> 00:11:30.641
We find men on the marching lines
of the Civil Rights Movement

00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:32.015
saying, "I am a man."

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:36.436
Again, people of color
appealing to a commonality of anatomy

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.150
over a difference of anatomy,
again, successfully.

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:42.211
We see the same thing
with the disability rights movement.

00:11:42.552 --> 00:11:44.710
The problem is, of course,

00:11:44.734 --> 00:11:47.112
that, as we begin to look
at all that commonality,

00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:50.561
we have to begin to question
why we maintain certain divisions.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.314
Mind you, I want to maintain
some divisions,

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.005
anatomically, in our culture.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.709
For example, I don't want to give a fish
the same rights as a human.

00:11:58.733 --> 00:12:01.318
I don't want to say
we give up entirely on anatomy.

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:03.009
I don't want to say a five-year-old

00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:05.664
should be allowed to consent
to sex or consent to marry.

00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:07.655
So there are some anatomical divisions

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:10.988
that make sense to me
and that I think we should retain.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:13.905
But the challenge is trying
to figure out which ones they are

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:16.540
and why do we retain them,
and do they have meaning.

00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:20.354
So let's go back to those two beings
conceived at the beginning of this talk.

00:12:20.378 --> 00:12:22.236
We have two beings, both conceived

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.751
in the middle of 1979
on the exact same day.

00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:29.525
Let's imagine one of them, Mary,
is born three months prematurely,

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:32.051
so she's born on June 1, 1980.

00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:36.248
Henry, by contrast, is born at term,
so he's born on March 1, 1980.

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:38.638
Simply by virtue of the fact

00:12:38.662 --> 00:12:41.120
that Mary was born
prematurely three months,

00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:45.386
she comes into all sorts of rights
three months earlier than Henry does --

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.625
the right to consent to sex,
the right to vote, the right to drink.

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:51.282
Henry has to wait for all of that,

00:12:51.306 --> 00:12:54.320
not because he's actually
any different in age, biologically,

00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:56.609
except in terms of when he was born.

00:12:57.249 --> 00:13:00.409
We find other kinds of weirdness
in terms of what their rights are.

00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:02.626
Henry, by virtue of being
assumed to be male --

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.041
although I haven't told you
that he's the XY one --

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:09.236
by virtue of being assumed to be male
is now liable to be drafted,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.200
which Mary does not need to worry about.

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:14.997
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states
have the same right

00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:16.621
that Henry has in all the states,

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:18.127
namely, the right to marry.

00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:20.915
Henry can marry, in every state, a woman,

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:23.947
but Mary can only marry today
in a few states, a woman.

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:27.372
So we have these anatomical
categories that persist,

00:13:27.396 --> 00:13:31.145
that are in many ways
problematic and questionable.

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:32.890
And the question to me becomes:

00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:38.902
What do we do, as our science
gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:41.496
that we reach the point
where we have to admit

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.397
that a democracy
that's been based on anatomy

00:13:44.421 --> 00:13:45.853
might start falling apart?

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.864
I don't want to give up the science,
but at the same time,

00:13:49.888 --> 00:13:53.036
it feels sometimes like the science
is coming out from under us.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.236
So where do we go?

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:59.170
It seems like what happens in our culture
is a sort of pragmatic attitude:

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:02.632
"We have to draw the line somewhere,
so we will draw the line somewhere."

00:14:02.656 --> 00:14:05.342
But a lot of people get stuck
in a very strange position.

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:10.236
So for example, Texas has at one point
decided that what it means to marry a man

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.655
is to mean that you don't have
a Y chromosome,

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:15.749
and what it means to marry a woman
means you have a Y chromosome.

00:14:15.773 --> 00:14:18.495
In practice they don't test people
for their chromosomes.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.002
But this is also very bizarre,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.346
because of the story I told you
at the beginning

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.180
about androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:27.736
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers
of modern democracy,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.940
Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:32.167
he offers us something of a solution
in his "I have a dream" speech.

00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:35.458
He says we should judge people
"based not on the color of their skin,

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:37.353
but on the content of their character,"

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.899
moving beyond anatomy.

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.902
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds
like a really good idea."

00:14:41.926 --> 00:14:43.582
But in practice, how do you do it?

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:46.556
How do you judge people based
on the content of character?

00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:48.245
I also want to point out

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:52.080
that I'm not sure that is how we should
distribute rights in terms of humans,

00:14:52.104 --> 00:14:55.407
because, I have to admit, that there
are some golden retrievers I know

00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:59.008
that are probably more deserving of social
services than some humans I know.

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:02.627
I also want to say there are probably
also some yellow Labradors that I know

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:05.674
that are more capable of informed,
intelligent, mature decisions

00:15:05.698 --> 00:15:08.420
about sexual relations
than some 40-year-olds that I know.

00:15:08.444 --> 00:15:12.622
So how do we operationalize
the question of content of character?

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:14.571
It turns out to be really difficult.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.076
And part of me also wonders,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.972
what if content of character

00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:21.236
turns out to be something
that's scannable in the future --

00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:24.290
able to be seen with an fMRI?

00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:25.925
Do we really want to go there?

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.696
I'm not sure where we go.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.271
What I do know is that it seems
to be really important

00:15:30.295 --> 00:15:33.238
to think about the idea
of the United States being in the lead

00:15:33.262 --> 00:15:35.266
of thinking about this issue of democracy.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.001
We've done a really good job
struggling with democracy,

00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:40.359
and I think we would do
a good job in the future.

00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:42.986
We don't have a situation
that Iran has, for example,

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.303
where a man who's sexually
attracted to other men

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:46.524
is liable to be murdered,

00:15:46.548 --> 00:15:48.719
unless he's willing
to submit to a sex change,

00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:50.630
in which case he's allowed to live.

00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:52.959
We don't have that kind of situation.

00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:56.282
I'm glad to say we don't have
the kind of situation with --

00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:58.289
a surgeon I talked to a few years ago

00:15:58.313 --> 00:16:00.749
who had brought over a set
of conjoined twins

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:03.684
in order to separate them,
partly to make a name for himself.

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:07.158
But when I was on the phone with him,
asking why he'll do this surgery --

00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:10.908
this was a very high-risk surgery --
his answer was that, in this other nation,

00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:14.565
these children were going to be treated
very badly, and so he had to do this.

00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:17.741
My response to him was, "Well,
have you considered political asylum

00:16:17.765 --> 00:16:19.372
instead of a separation surgery?"

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.845
The United States has offered
tremendous possibility

00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:24.236
for allowing people
to be the way they are,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.958
without having them have
to be changed for the sake of the state.

00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:30.160
So I think we have to be in the lead.

00:16:30.184 --> 00:16:32.641
Well, just to close,
I want to suggest to you

00:16:32.665 --> 00:16:35.196
that I've been talking
a lot about the Fathers.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.236
And I want to think
about the possibilities

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.165
of what democracy might look like,
or might have looked like,

00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:42.062
if we had more involved the mothers.

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:45.683
And I want to say something
a little bit radical for a feminist,

00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:49.552
and that is that I think that there may be
different kinds of insights

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.825
that can come from different
kinds of anatomies,

00:16:51.849 --> 00:16:54.471
particularly when we have
people thinking in groups.

00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:57.002
For years, because
I've been interested in intersex,

00:16:57.026 --> 00:16:59.503
I've also been interested
in sex-difference research.

00:16:59.527 --> 00:17:01.880
And one of the things
that I've been interested in

00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:04.506
is looking at the differences
between males and females

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.169
in terms of the way they think
and operate in the world.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.266
And what we know
from cross-cultural studies

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.130
is that females, on average --

00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:13.236
not everyone, but on average --

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.151
are more inclined to be very attentive
to complex social relations

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:19.753
and to taking care of people

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:22.053
who are, basically,
vulnerable within the group.

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:24.986
And so if we think about that,

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.011
we have an interesting situation in hands.

00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:29.001
Years ago, when I was in graduate school,

00:17:29.025 --> 00:17:32.222
one of my graduate advisors
who knew I was interested in feminism --

00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:34.482
I considered myself
a feminist, as I still do,

00:17:34.506 --> 00:17:36.055
asked a really strange question.

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:38.988
He said, "Tell me what's feminine
about feminism."

00:17:39.012 --> 00:17:42.183
And I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest
question I've ever heard.

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:44.781
Feminism is all about undoing
stereotypes about gender,

00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:46.867
so there's nothing
feminine about feminism."

00:17:46.891 --> 00:17:48.916
But the more I thought about his question,

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.158
the more I thought there might be
something feminine about feminism.

00:17:52.182 --> 00:17:54.891
That is to say, there might be
something, on average,

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:57.787
different about female
brains from male brains

00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:02.875
that makes us more attentive
to deeply complex social relationships,

00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:05.732
and more attentive
to taking care of the vulnerable.

00:18:05.756 --> 00:18:08.259
So whereas the Fathers
were extremely attentive

00:18:08.283 --> 00:18:12.094
to figuring out how to protect
individuals from the state,

00:18:12.118 --> 00:18:15.963
it's possible that if we injected
more mothers into this concept,

00:18:15.987 --> 00:18:19.593
what we would have is more of a concept
of not just how to protect,

00:18:19.617 --> 00:18:21.937
but how to care for each other.

00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:24.534
And maybe that's where
we need to go in the future,

00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:26.765
when we take democracy beyond anatomy,

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.324
is to think less about the individual body
in terms of the identity,

00:18:30.348 --> 00:18:32.698
and think more about those relationships.

00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:36.187
So that as we the people
try to create a more perfect union,

00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:39.104
we're thinking about what we do
for each other.

00:18:39.128 --> 00:18:40.279
Thank you.

00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:43.077
