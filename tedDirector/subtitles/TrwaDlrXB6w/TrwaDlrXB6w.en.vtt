00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Well, there's lots to talk about,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
but I think I'm just going to play to start off.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:34.260
(Music)

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
♫ When I wake up ♫

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
♫ in the morning ♫

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
♫ I pour the coffee ♫

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
♫ I read the paper ♫

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
♫ And then I slowly ♫

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
♫ and so softly ♫

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
♫ do the dishes ♫

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
♫ So feed the fishes ♫

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
♫ Like it's gonna be ♫

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.260
♫ your last day ♫

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
♫ here on Earth ♫

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:42.260
(Applause)

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
All right.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
So, I wanted to do something special today.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
in the last five or six months.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And there's few things more thrilling

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
than playing a song

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
for the first time in front of an audience,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
especially when it's half-finished.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
(Laughter)

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
I'm kind of hoping some conversations here

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
might help me finish it.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Because it gets into all sorts

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of crazy realms.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And so this is basically a song

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
about loops,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
but not the kind of loops that I make up here.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
They're feedback loops.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And in the audio world

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
that's when the microphone gets too close

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
to its sound source,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and then it gets in this self-destructive loop

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
that creates a very unpleasant sound.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And I'm going to demonstrate for you.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
(Laughter)

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.260
♫ This is a -- (Feedback)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate --

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
(Laughter)

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
-- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And I've been thinking about

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
from, say, the ecological, okay.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
There seems to be a rule in nature

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
that if you get too close to where you came from,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
it gets ugly.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
So like, you can't feed cows their own brains

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
or you get mad cow disease,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and inbreeding and incest

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and, let's see,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
what's the other one?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
where the body attacks itself

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
a little too overzealously

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and destroys the host,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
or the person.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Because although I've used scientific terms

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
in songs,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And there's some things

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
you just don't need to have in songs.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
So I'm trying to bridge this gap

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
between this idea and this melody.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
but when I close my eyes sometimes

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and try to sleep,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And it's like your eyes

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
start straining to see themselves.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
That's what it feels like to me.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It's not pleasant.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
(Laughter)

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
but they seem to be trying.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Or ears being able to hear themselves --

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
it's just impossible.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
That's the thing.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
So, I've been working on this song

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
that mentions these things

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and then also imagines

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
a person who's been so successful

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
at defending themselves from heartbreak

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
that they're left to do the deed themselves,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
if that's possible.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And that's what the song is asking.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
All right.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It doesn't have a name yet.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:37.260
(Music)

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260
♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
♫ You've done the impossible now ♫

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
♫ Took yourself apart ♫

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
♫ No one can break your heart ♫

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
♫ So you wear it out ♫

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
♫ And you wring it out ♫

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
♫ And you wear it out ♫

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
♫ And you break it yourself ♫

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.260
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
♫ Breaking your own ♫

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.260
(Applause)

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
Thanks.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
(Applause)

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
All right.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
You can throw out crazy theories

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and not have to back it up with data

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
or graphs or research.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
would be what the world needs now,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
just a little bit.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Applause)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
I'm going to finish up with a song of mine

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
called "Weather Systems."

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:20.260
(Music)

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
♫ Quiet ♫

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
♫ Quiet down, she said ♫

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.260
♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.260
♫ I can see your ♫

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
♫ cells grow ♫

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
♫ Hold still awhile ♫

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
♫ Don't spill the wine ♫

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
♫ I can see it all from here ♫

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
♫ I can see ♫

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
♫ oh, I ♫

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
♫ I can see ♫

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
♫ weather systems ♫

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
♫ of the world ♫

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
♫ Weather systems ♫

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
♫ of the world ♫

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
♫ Some things you say ♫

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.260
♫ are not for sale ♫

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
♫ I would hold it where ♫

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.260
♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
♫ scared ♫

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
♫ Hold still a while ♫

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
♫ Don't spill the wine ♫

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
♫ I can see it all from here ♫

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
♫ I can see ♫

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
♫ oh, I ♫

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
♫ I can see ♫

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.260
♫ weather systems of the world ♫

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.260
♫ Weather systems ♫

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.260
♫ of the world ♫

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
Thanks.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:13.260
