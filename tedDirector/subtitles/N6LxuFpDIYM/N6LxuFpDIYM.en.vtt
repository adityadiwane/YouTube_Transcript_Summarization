00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:18.331
An 18-year-old, African-American male
joined the United States Air Force

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.585
and was assigned to Mountain Home 
Air Force Base

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.472
and was a part of the air police squadron.

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:28.121
Upon first arriving there,
the first goal that I had

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.897
was for me to identify an apartment,

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:34.717
so I could bring my wife 
and my new baby, Melanie,

00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:36.707
out to join me in Idaho.

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:39.219
I immediately went to 
the personnel office,

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.153
and talking with the guys in personnel,

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:46.319
they said, "Hey, no problem finding 
an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.509
The people down there love us 
because they know if they have an airman

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.872
who is coming in to rent 
one of their apartments,

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:56.235
they'll always get their money."

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.108
And that was a really important thing.

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.927
He said, "So here is a list 
of people that you can call,

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.942
and then they will then allow you 
to select the apartment that you want."

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:07.806
So I got the list; I made the call.

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:10.824
The lady answered on the other end
and I told her what I wanted.

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:13.126
She said, "Oh, great you called.

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:17.078
We have four or five apartments
available right now."

00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:20.072
She said, "Do you want 
a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"

00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:22.125
Then she said, "Let's not talk about that.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.946
Just come on down, 
select the apartment that you want.

00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:26.834
We'll sign the contract

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.741
and you'll have keys in your hand
to get your family out here right away."

00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:32.270
So I was excited.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.666
I jumped in my car. I went downtown
and knocked on the door.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.327
When I knocked on the door, 
the woman came to the door,

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.261
and she looked at me, and she said,
"Can I help you?"

00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:45.102
I said, "Yes, I'm the person 
who called about the apartments.

00:01:45.102 --> 00:01:47.516
I was just coming down 
to make my selection."

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:50.052
She said, "You know what? 
I'm really sorry,

00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:54.140
but my husband rented those apartments
and didn't tell me about them."

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.075
I said, "You mean he rented 
all five of them in one hour?"

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:02.460
She didn't give me a response,
and what she said was this:

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.685
She said, "Why don't you
leave your number,

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.722
and if we have some openings, 
I'll give you a call?"

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.004
Needless to say,
I did not get a call from her.

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.280
Nor did I get any responses 
from the other people

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.801
that they gave me on the list
where I could get apartments.

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.092
So as a result of that,
and feeling rejected,

00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:23.978
I went back to the base, and I talked
to the squadron commander.

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:26.244
His name was McDow, Major McDow.

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:28.436
I said, "Major McDow, I need your help."

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:31.111
I told him what happened, 
and here's what he said to me:

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.453
He said, "James, I would love to help you.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.182
But you know the problem:

00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:39.416
We can't make people rent to folks 
that they don't want to rent to.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:43.914
And besides, we have a great relationship
with people in the community

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.956
and we really don't want to damage that."

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:48.226
He said, "So maybe this is 
what you should do.

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:50.864
Why don't you let your family stay home,

00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:53.818
because you do know 
that you get a 30-day leave.

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:55.213
So once a year,

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:59.818
you can go home to your family,
spend 30 days and then come on back."

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:01.988
Needless to say, that didn't
resonate for me.

00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:04.914
So after leaving him, 
I went back to personnel,

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:06.414
and talking to the clerk,

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:09.215
he said, "Jim, I think I have a 
solution for you.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:13.507
There's an airman who is leaving
and he has a trailer.

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:15.343
If you noticed, in Mountain Home,

00:03:15.343 --> 00:03:17.991
there are trailer parks and trailers
all over the place.

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:21.534
You can buy his trailer,
and you'd probably get a really good deal

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.208
because he wants to get out of town
as soon as possible.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.190
And that would take care of your problem,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.342
and that would provide 
the solution for you."

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.578
So I immediately jumped in my car,
went downtown, saw the trailer --

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.422
it was a small trailer,

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.032
but under the circumstances,

00:03:35.032 --> 00:03:37.447
I figured that was the 
best thing that I could do.

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:39.008
So I bought the trailer.

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.279
And then I asked him, 
"Can I just leave the trailer here,

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.513
and that would take care 
of all my problems,

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:46.682
I wouldn't have to find
another trailer park?"

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:50.536
He said, "Before I say yes to that, 
I need to check with management."

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:51.968
So I get back to the base,

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.125
he called me back and management said,

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.569
"No, you can't leave the trailer here

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.133
because we had promised that slot
to some other people."

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:01.944
And that was strange to me

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:04.515
because there were several 
other slots that were open,

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:08.202
but it just so happened that he 
had promised that slot to someone else.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:09.504
So, what I did --

00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:13.571
and he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim,
because there are a lot of trailer parks."

00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:17.420
So I put out another exhaustive list
of going to trailer parks.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.490
I went to one after another, 
after another.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.092
And I got the same kind of rejection there

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:26.221
that I received when I was looking 
for the apartment.

00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.550
And as a result, the kind of comments
that they made to me,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.753
in addition to saying that they
didn't have any slots open,

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:39.008
one person said, "Jim, the reason
why we can't rent to you,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:43.188
we already have a Negro family
in the trailer park."

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:47.224
He said, "And it's not me, 
because I like you people."

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:48.526
(Laughs)

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:52.257
And that's what I did, too.
I chuckled, too.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.233
He said, "But here's the problem:

00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:58.542
If I let you in, the other tenants 
will move out

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:01.725
and I can't afford to take
that kind of a hit."

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:04.052
He said, "I just can't rent to you."

00:05:04.052 --> 00:05:06.603
Even though that was discouraging,
it didn't stop me.

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:07.933
I kept looking,

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:12.233
and I looked at the far end 
of the town in Mountain Home,

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.327
and there was a small trailer park.

00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:16.414
I mean, a really small trailer park.

00:05:16.414 --> 00:05:18.462
It didn't have any paved roads in it,

00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:20.470
it didn't have the concrete slabs,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.019
it didn't have fencing

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:25.111
to portion off your trailer slot 
from other trailer slots.

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:26.923
It didn't have a laundry facility.

00:05:26.923 --> 00:05:29.116
But the conclusion I reached 
at that moment

00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:31.398
was that I didn't have 
a lot of other options.

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:34.854
So I called my wife, and I said,
"We're going to make this one work."

00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:36.399
And we moved into it

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.117
and we became homeowners
in Mountain Home, Idaho.

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:43.308
And of course, eventually
things settled down.

00:05:44.758 --> 00:05:50.236
Four years after that, I received papers
to move from Mountain Home, Idaho

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:53.270
to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.180
We won't even talk about that.
It was another great location. (Laughter)

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.888
So my challenge then was to get my family 
from Mountain Home, Idaho

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:03.639
to Sharon, Pennsylvania.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.169
That wasn't a problem because we
had just purchased a brand-new automobile.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.569
My mother called 
and said she'll fly out.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.951
She'll be with us as we drive,
she'll help us manage the children.

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:17.881
So she came out, her and Alice 
put a lot of food together for the trip.

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.964
That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:24.110
Great trip, having a great time, 
good conversation.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.944
Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock,
we got a little bit tired,

00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:30.783
and we said, "Why don't we get
a motel so that we can rest

00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:33.164
and then have an early start
in the morning?"

00:06:33.164 --> 00:06:36.544
So we were looking at a number 
of the motels as we drove down the road,

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:40.021
and we saw one, it was a great
big, bright flashing light that said,

00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.325
"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."

00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:43.622
So we stopped in.

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:45.807
They were in the parking lot, 
I went inside.

00:06:45.807 --> 00:06:47.134
When I walked inside,

00:06:47.134 --> 00:06:50.311
the lady was just finishing up 
one contract with some folks,

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:52.400
some other people 
were coming in behind me.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.133
And so I walked to the counter,

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.296
and she said, "How can I help you?"

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:59.556
I said, "I would like to get a motel 
for the evening for my family."

00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:04.058
She said, "You know, I'm really sorry,
I just rented the last one.

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.704
We will not have any more 
until the morning."

00:07:06.704 --> 00:07:10.685
She said, "But if you go down the road
about an hour, 45 minutes,

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:13.030
there's another trailer park down there."

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.811
I said, "Yeah, but you still have the 
'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.287
She said, "Oh, I forgot."

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.663
And she reached over 
and turned the light off.

00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:22.904
She looked at me and I looked at her.

00:07:22.904 --> 00:07:24.662
There were other people in the room.

00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:27.068
She kind of looked at them.
No one said anything.

00:07:27.068 --> 00:07:30.424
So I just got the hint and I left,
and went outside to the parking lot.

00:07:30.424 --> 00:07:34.574
And I told my mother and I told my wife
and also Melanie, and I said,

00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:38.370
"It looks like we're going to have to
drive a little bit further down the road

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.726
to be able to sleep tonight."

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.899
And we did drive down the road,

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.421
but just before we took off 
and pulled out of the parking lot,

00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:47.914
guess what happened?

00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:49.733
The light came back on.

00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:52.593
And it said, "Vacancies, 
Vacancies, Vacancies."

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:54.979
We were able to find a nice place.

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:59.715
It wasn't our preference,
but it was secure and it was clean.

00:07:59.715 --> 00:08:02.537
And so we had a great sleep that night.

00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:04.356
The piece that's important about that

00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:07.468
is that we had similar
kinds of experiences

00:08:07.468 --> 00:08:10.650
from Idaho all the way through 
to Pennsylvania,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.951
where we were rejected from hotels, 
motels and restaurants.

00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:17.151
But we made it to Pennsylvania.

00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:21.711
We got the family settled.
Everyone was glad to see the kids.

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:26.286
I jumped on a plane and shot off
to Goose Bay, Labrador,

00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:27.947
which is another story, right?

00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:29.254
(Laughter)

00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:34.657
Here it is, 53 years later,

00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:39.086
I now have nine grandchildren, 
two great-grandchildren.

00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:41.863
Five of the grandchildren are boys.

00:08:41.863 --> 00:08:47.076
I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad,
one in medical school.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:49.690
I have a couple that are trending.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.455
They're almost there but not quite.
(Laughter)

00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:55.555
I have one who has been 
in college now for eight years.

00:08:55.555 --> 00:08:56.975
(Laughter)

00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:00.346
He doesn't have a degree yet, 
but he wants to be a comedian.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:03.464
So we're just trying to get him
to stay in school.

00:09:03.464 --> 00:09:04.994
Because you never know,

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:08.894
just because you're funny at home,
does not make you a comedian, right?

00:09:08.894 --> 00:09:10.646
(Laughter)

00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:13.078
But the thing about it, 
they're all good kids --

00:09:13.078 --> 00:09:17.338
no drugs, no babies 
in high school, no crime.

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:19.896
So with that being the backdrop,

00:09:19.896 --> 00:09:22.117
I was sitting in my TV room watching TV,

00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:26.670
and they were talking about Ferguson
and all the hullabaloo that was going on.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:32.141
And all of a sudden, one of the news 
commentators got on the air and she said,

00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:34.939
"In the last three months,

00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:38.808
eight unarmed African-American males

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:46.357
have been killed by police,
white homeowners, or white citizens."

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:49.495
For some reason, at that moment
it just all hit me.

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:53.487
I said, "What is it? It is so insane.

00:09:53.487 --> 00:09:58.625
What is the hatred that's causing people 
to do these kinds of things?"

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.073
Just then, one of my grandsons called.

00:10:01.073 --> 00:10:04.312
He said, "Granddad, did you hear
what they said on TV?"

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.770
I said, "Yes, I did."

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.524
He said, "I'm just so confused.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:12.094
We do everything we do,
but it seems that driving while black,

00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:16.494
walking while black, talking while black,
it's just dangerous.

00:10:16.494 --> 00:10:21.373
What can we do? We do everything
that you told us to do.

00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:23.163
When stopped by the police,

00:10:23.163 --> 00:10:27.140
we place both hands on the steering wheel
at the 12 o'clock position.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.767
If asked to get identification,

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:35.675
we tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over 
into the glove compartment to get my I.D.'

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:38.440
When pulled out of the car to be searched,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.589
when laid on the ground to be searched,

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:42.731
when our trunks are opened to be searched,

00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:46.991
we don't push back, we don't challenge
because we know, you've told us,

00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:49.030
'Don't you challenge the police.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.638
After it's over, call us and we'll
be the ones to challenge."

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.370
He said, "And this is the piece 
that really bugs me:

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.988
Our white friends, our buddies,
we kind of hang together.

00:10:58.988 --> 00:11:02.225
When they hear about these kinds
of things happening to us, they say,

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.413
'Why do you take it?

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:07.392
You need to push back.
You need to challenge.

00:11:07.392 --> 00:11:10.154
You need to ask them 
for their identification.'"

00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:12.761
And here's what the boys have been
taught to tell them:

00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:15.987
"We know that you can do that,
but please do not do that

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:18.026
while we're in the car

00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:21.813
because the consequences for you
are significantly different

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:23.862
than the consequences for us."

00:11:23.862 --> 00:11:27.360
And so as a grandparent, 
what do I tell my grandsons?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.706
How do I keep them safe?
How do I keep them alive?

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:33.227
As a result of this, people have
come to me and said, 

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:35.908
"Jim, are you angry?"

00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:40.619
And my response to that is this:

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:46.065
"I don't have the luxury of being angry,

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:51.075
and I also know the consequences 
of being enraged."

00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:53.168
So therefore, the only thing that I can do

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:59.456
is take my collective intellect and my
energy and my ideas and my experiences

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:03.445
and dedicate myself to challenge, 
at any point in time,

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:06.326
anything that looks 
like it might be racist.

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:09.059
So the first thing I have 
to do is to educate,

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:12.327
the second thing I have to do 
is to unveil racism,

00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:15.727
and the last thing I need to do
is do everything within my power

00:12:15.727 --> 00:12:22.864
to eradicate racism in my lifetime
by any means necessary.

00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:25.290
The second thing I do is this:

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.976
I want to appeal to Americans.

00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:33.420
I want to appeal to their humanity,
to their dignity,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.887
to their civic pride and ownership

00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:45.952
to be able to not react to these 
heinous crimes in an adverse manner.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:52.061
But instead, to elevate your level
of societal knowledge,

00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:56.465
your level of societal awareness
and societal consciousness

00:12:56.465 --> 00:13:00.484
to then collectively come together,
all of us come together,

00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:07.552
to make sure that we speak out against
and we challenge any kind of insanity,

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:14.753
any kind of insanity that makes it 
okay to kill unarmed people,

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.335
regardless of their ethnicity,

00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:19.438
regardless of their race,

00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:21.925
regardless of their diversity makeup.

00:13:21.925 --> 00:13:24.924
We have to challenge that.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:29.014
The only way I think we can do that
is through a collective.

00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:32.914
We need to have black and white 
and Asian and Hispanic

00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:34.614
just to step forward and say,

00:13:34.614 --> 00:14:01.634
"We are not going to accept 
that kind of behavior anymore."
