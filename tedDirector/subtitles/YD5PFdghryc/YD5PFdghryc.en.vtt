00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.211
As a little girl, I always imagined

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.546
I would one day run away.

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:19.010
From the age of six on,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.462
I kept a packed bag with some clothes

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:22.988
and cans of food tucked away

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.982
in the back of a closet.

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:27.604
There was a deep restlessness in me,

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:30.150
a primal fear that I would fall prey

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.925
to a life of routine and boredom.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.534
And so, many of my early memories involved

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:39.100
intricate daydreams where
I would walk across borders,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.468
forage for berries,

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:42.532
and meet all kinds of strange people

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:45.576
living unconventional lives on the road.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:48.160
Years have passed, but many of the adventures

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.927
I fantasized about as a child --

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:52.524
traveling and weaving my way

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.524
between worlds other than my own â€”

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:56.124
have become realities through my work

00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:58.685
as a documentary photographer.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.820
But no other experience has felt as true

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.740
to my childhood dreams

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.458
as living amongst and documenting the lives

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:11.150
of fellow wanderers across the United States.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.910
This is the nomadic dream,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.820
a different kind of American dream

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.464
lived by young hobos, travelers,

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:21.848
hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.197
In most of our minds,

00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:26.288
the vagabond is a creature from the past.

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:28.591
The word "hobo" conjures up an old

00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.028
black and white image

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:32.534
of a weathered old man covered in coal,

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:34.935
legs dangling out of a boxcar,

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:37.047
but these photographs are in color,

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:38.830
and they portray a community

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.552
swirling across the country,

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.377
fiercely alive and creatively free,

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:45.876
seeing sides of America that no one else

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.066
gets to see.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.756
Like their predecessors, today's nomads

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:53.423
travel the steel and asphalt arteries

00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:55.112
of the United States.

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:58.300
By day, they hop freight trains,
stick out their thumbs,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.154
and ride the highways with anyone

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:03.170
from truckers to soccer moms.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.496
By night, they sleep beneath the stars,

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.178
huddled together with their packs of dogs,

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:11.886
cats and pet rats between their bodies.

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:14.514
Some travelers take to the road by choice,

00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:17.100
renouncing materialism, traditional jobs

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.034
and university degrees in exchange 
for a glimmer of adventure.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:24.284
Others come from the underbelly of society,

00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:27.324
never given a chance to mobilize upwards:

00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:30.700
foster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.844
abuse and unforgiving homes.

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:36.754
Where others see stories of privation

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:38.834
and economic failure,

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:40.694
travelers view their own existence

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:44.267
through the prism of liberation and freedom.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.482
They'd rather live off of the excess

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.432
of what they view as a wasteful consumer society

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:52.233
than slave away at an unrealistic chance

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.912
at the traditional American dream.

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:57.001
They take advantage of the fact

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.549
that in the United States,

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.370
up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.003
by scavenging for perfectly good produce

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.677
in dumpsters and trash cans.

00:03:07.677 --> 00:03:10.046
They sacrifice material comforts in exchange

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:12.769
for the space and the time to explore

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.491
a creative interior,

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:19.373
to dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:21.881
But there are many aspects to this life

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.244
that are far from idyllic.

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.367
No one loses their inner demons

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.076
by taking to the road.

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:31.238
Addiction is real, the elements are real,

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:33.450
freight trains maim and kill,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.110
and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.000
to the exhaustive list of laws

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.106
that criminalize homeless existence.

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:43.936
Who here knows that in many cities

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:46.586
across the United States it is now illegal

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:48.619
to sit on the sidewalk,

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:52.006
to wrap oneself in a blanket,

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.741
to sleep in your own car,

00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:58.100
to offer food to a stranger?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.872
I know about these laws because I've watched

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.664
as friends and other travelers

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.334
were hauled off to jail or received citations

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:07.922
for committing these so-called crimes.

00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:10.083
Many of you might be wondering why anyone

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.794
would choose a life like this,

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:14.160
under the thumb of discriminatory laws,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.478
eating out of trash cans,

00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:17.267
sleeping under bridges,

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.518
picking up seasonal jobs here and there.

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:23.032
The answer to such a question is as varied

00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:25.568
as the people that take to the road,

00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:28.950
but travelers often respond with a single word:

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.281
freedom.

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:34.794
Until we live in a society where every human

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:36.863
is assured dignity in their labor

00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:38.738
so that they can work to live well,

00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:40.845
not only work to survive,

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.762
there will always be an element of those

00:04:42.762 --> 00:04:45.894
who seek the open road as a means of escape,

00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:50.952
of liberation and, of course, of rebellion.

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:52.968
Thank you.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:55.237
(Applause)
