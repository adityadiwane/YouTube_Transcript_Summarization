00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi everyone.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Thank you.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And I want to share with you my latest art project.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
It's a children's book for the iPad.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It's a little quirky and silly.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It's called "Pop-It,"

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
(Music)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
So this is about potty training --

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
as most of you, I hope, know.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
You can tickle the rug.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
You can make the baby poop.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
You can do all those fun things.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
You can burst bubbles.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
You can draw, as everyone should.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
But you know, I have a problem with children's books:

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
I think they're full of propaganda.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
It's not the way I was brought up.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
If you notice carefully,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
You don't like it?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
(Laughter)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I have to tell you about my childhood.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I went to this very proper Christian school

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and I am.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
which was probably the only Hindu house

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
I remember we cried profusely

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
when the little goats we played with in the summer

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
became biriani.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
(Laughter)

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We all had to fast during Ramadan.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It was a very beautiful time.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
But I must say,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Babri Masjid --

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
one of the most beautiful mosques in India,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
was demolished by Hindu activists.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
This caused major riots in my city.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And for the first time,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
I was affected

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
by this communal unrest.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
My little five-year-old kid neighbor

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
comes running in,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and he says, "Rags, Rags.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.260
(Laughter)

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
He's like, "Huh!"

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
You know, my work is inspired

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
by events such as this.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Even in my gallery shows,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I try and revisit historic events

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
like Babri Masjid,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
distill only its emotional residue

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and image my own life.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Imagine history being taught differently.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Remember that children's book

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I have another idea.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
It's a children's book about Indian independence --

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
very patriotic.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.260
(Applause)

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
You have to separate fact from bias, right.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Even my books on children

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
have cute, fuzzy animals.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
But they're playing geopolitics.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
They're playing out Israel-Palestine,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
India-Pakistan.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
You know, I'm making a very important argument.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And my argument [is]

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that the only way for us to teach creativity

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
is by teaching children perspectives

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
at the earliest stage.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And conversely,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
only when you teach perspectives

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
will a child be able to imagine

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and put themselves in the shoes

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
of someone who is different from them.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
I'm making an argument that art and creativity

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
are very essential tools in empathy.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
You know, I can't promise my child

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
a life without bias --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
we're all biased --

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Thank you very much.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
(Applause)
