00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:20.679
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.525
Zipcar buys cars and parks them

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:26.101
throughout dense metropolitan areas

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:29.229
for people to use, by the hour and by the day,

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.518
instead of owning their own cars.

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:35.402
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.506
and each driver drives about 80 percent less

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.866
because they're now paying the full cost,

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.442
all at once, in real time.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:47.687
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:51.938
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,

00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:53.923
and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:56.602
with my husband and youngest child,

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.822
and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.

00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:03.079
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.746
to their friends and neighbors.

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:10.002
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.329
We bring the power of a corporation

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.442
to individuals who add their cars to the network.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.130
Some people call this peer-to-peer.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.418
This does express the humanity of what's going on,

00:01:22.418 --> 00:01:24.855
and the personal relationships,

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.551
but that is also like saying that it's the same thing

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.404
as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:31.629
That's peer-to-peer.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:36.516
It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:44.088
or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:46.450
But what's really happening is that we've got the power

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.655
of a free and open Internet,

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:51.860
and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.547
and the peers are now in partnership with the company,

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:58.764
creating shared value on shared values,

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:03.733
and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:06.775
I call this Peers, Inc.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:09.336
The incorporated side, the company,

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:12.153
is doing things that it does really well.

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:15.922
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,

00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:19.665
significant and long-term resource investment,

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:22.470
the expertise of many different kinds of people

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.458
and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:28.722
consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:31.042
that we really want as consumers,

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:33.985
and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:39.025
and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.362
Peers are giving and doing things

00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:44.369
that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:48.193
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.850
expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.611
It delivers localization and customization,

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.018
specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks

00:02:57.018 --> 00:02:59.866
and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:03.962
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:07.525
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:08.941
and I'll talk about that later.

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:12.357
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:16.937
and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:21.301
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.289
Some of my favorite examples:

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:27.242
in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:28.645
three and a half million people have joined up,

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.203
and a million rides are shared every day.

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:34.435
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent

00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:37.522
of 2,500 TGV trains,

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:41.498
and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.

00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:44.242
This is all happening with excess capacity.

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:47.729
And it's not just with transportation, my love,

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.882
but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.693
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,

00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:58.149
and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:02.417
Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:05.242
what people would do for five dollars.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:08.928
And not just easy things that anyone can do.

00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:13.704
This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.900
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.700
complex design and engineering services.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.253
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.

00:04:24.253 --> 00:04:29.043
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."

00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:31.315
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.

00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:34.586
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:36.252
and they're selling it in a marketplace.

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:39.667
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:42.235
and after seven years, last year it delivered

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:47.727
530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals

00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:50.883
who have been making those objects.

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:53.642
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,

00:04:53.642 --> 00:04:56.058
are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:57.735
I see this incredible speed and scale.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:00.244
You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:03.012
to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"

00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:08.063
Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:12.076
I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:15.265
Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:17.448
would beat out Google Video? Why?

00:05:17.448 --> 00:05:19.540
I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.172
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:24.151
the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,

00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.145
and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:30.225
that are always participating on these networks.

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:34.424
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,

00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:36.285
and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent

00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.684
the last two years doing that in Paris.

00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:43.105
So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.980
building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.260
because now every single thing we do has these two

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.687
different bodies that I have to be thinking about:

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:53.551
the owners who are going to provide the cars

00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:55.998
and the drivers who are going to rent them.

00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:59.470
Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.934
There are many, many examples and I'll give you one

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:05.256
that is not my favorite example: insurance.

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:09.785
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:12.774
Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:16.520
and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.351
they'd never thought of it before.

00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:21.718
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,

00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:24.502
trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,

00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:28.090
and the result was that we were able to provide owners

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.382
protection for their own driving records and their own history.

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:34.198
The cars are completely insured during the rental,

00:06:34.198 --> 00:06:37.862
and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.367
They need a low deductible,

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.615
and 24-hour roadside assistance.

00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:45.499
So this was a trick to get these two sides.

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:49.747
So now I want to take you to the moment of --

00:06:49.747 --> 00:06:53.715
When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,

00:06:53.715 --> 00:06:56.109
there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,

00:06:56.109 --> 00:07:00.035
and then the service launches. What happens?

00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:04.435
So all those months of work, they come into play.

00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:08.633
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:12.243
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:14.669
All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.115
The reservations start coming in, and here,

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:22.182
owners who were getting text messages and emails

00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:25.275
that said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.

00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:29.679
You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:33.176
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them

00:07:33.176 --> 00:07:37.186
couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:40.814
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between

00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:43.957
industrial production and peer production."

00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:47.069
Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.543
is to provide a standardized, exact service model

00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:52.755
that is consistent every single time,

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.756
and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made

00:07:55.756 --> 00:07:57.129
using industrial production.

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:59.867
And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service

00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:01.451
that works fabulously.

00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:04.593
But what does peer production do? Peer production

00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:07.886
is this completely different way of doing things,

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:12.958
and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.279
the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:20.877
they figured out early on, we need to have ratings

00:08:20.877 --> 00:08:24.261
and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.

00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:27.509
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:31.824
who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:36.882
So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:39.316
because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:41.343
actually really did happen, and what's that?

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:44.156
That is the diversity of what's going on.

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:46.788
You have these different fabulous owners

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:50.218
and their different cars, different prices,

00:08:50.218 --> 00:08:52.356
different locations. (Laughter)

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:57.503
They dress differently, and they look different,

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:03.223
and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.

00:09:03.223 --> 00:09:06.333
Cool guys, excited guys,

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:11.112
and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:13.732
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars

00:09:13.732 --> 00:09:17.132
that are parked across France and 6,000 people

00:09:17.132 --> 00:09:19.500
who are members and eager to drive them.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.669
This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion

00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:26.030
for a traditional company.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.172
Back to this spectrum.

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:30.888
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side,

00:09:30.888 --> 00:09:33.112
but we actually had this real wow side.

00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:35.852
And I can tell you two great stories.

00:09:35.852 --> 00:09:38.819
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:42.554
to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,

00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:44.546
and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,

00:09:44.546 --> 00:09:47.066
and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:49.866
and this is where the best fish restaurant is."

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:52.702
And the peers also become,

00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:54.963
peers and owners create relationships,

00:09:54.963 --> 00:09:57.234
and so at the last minute people can --

00:09:57.234 --> 00:09:59.891
a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.381
is it available?" And that person will say,

00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.492
"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."

00:10:04.492 --> 00:10:07.891
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen,

00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:11.723
and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:14.203
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals,

00:10:14.203 --> 00:10:17.074
if you're a company, what happens is you might have

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.824
10 people who are in charge of innovation,

00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:20.782
or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.

00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:24.286
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have

00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:27.358
tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions

00:10:27.358 --> 00:10:30.461
of people who are creating experiments on this model,

00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:33.046
and so out of all that influence and that effort,

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:37.437
you are having this exceptional amount of innovation

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.856
that is coming out.

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:43.224
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I

00:10:43.224 --> 00:10:46.065
call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us

00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:48.941
about the power of the hive,

00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:51.877
and its incredible facility to create this platform

00:10:51.877 --> 00:10:55.898
that individuals want to participate and innovate on.

00:10:55.898 --> 00:10:59.318
And for me, when I think about our future,

00:10:59.318 --> 00:11:02.646
and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,

00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:05.732
the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:08.766
Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale

00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:13.352
and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:18.669
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.

00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:21.446
So I continue to think that

00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:24.701
transportation is the center of the hard universe.

00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:27.025
All problems come back to transportation for me.

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:30.872
But there are all these other areas that are these profound,

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:34.237
big problems that I know that we can work on,

00:11:34.237 --> 00:11:37.013
and people are working on them in many different sectors,

00:11:37.013 --> 00:11:39.558
but there's this really fabulous group of things

00:11:39.558 --> 00:11:44.044
with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.

00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:50.529
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:54.032
the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,

00:11:54.032 --> 00:11:56.628
and for me, what Peers, Inc. does

00:11:56.628 --> 00:12:00.464
is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:03.460
of the company and the corporation

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.325
and supercharging individuals.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:09.870
So for me, it's a collaboration.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.155
Together, we can. (Applause)

00:12:14.155 --> 00:12:16.740
Thank you. (Applause)
