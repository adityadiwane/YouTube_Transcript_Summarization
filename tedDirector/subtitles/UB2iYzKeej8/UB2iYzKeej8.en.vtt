00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
when you're faced with a complex problem?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
So, I hope to convince you that complex

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
doesn't always equal complicated.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is complex,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
is complicated.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So here's a food web,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
or a map of feeding links between species

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And this is what happens to that food web

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
All the grayed-out species disappear.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
These effects were all unanticipated,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So I want to share with you a couple key insights

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
about complexity we're learning from studying nature

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that maybe are applicable to other problems.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
First is the simple power of good visualization tools

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
to help untangle complexity

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
or the interconnections of habitat patches

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The next thing is that if you want to predict

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the effect of one species on another,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
if you focus only on that link,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and then you black box the rest,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
it's actually less predictable

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and from that place,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And we're discovering, with our research,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that's often very local to the node you care about

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
within one or two degrees.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
courtesy of the U.S. government.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Instantly ridiculed by the media

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
for being so crazy complicated.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And the stated goal was to increase popular support

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
for the Afghan government.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Clearly a complex problem,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
but is it complicated?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I can sink my teeth into this."

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
popular support for the government.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
three degrees away from that node

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Within that sphere,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and a very small minority are actual military actions.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and fair, transparent economic development

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and provisioning of services.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in 24 seconds.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Because simple answers may emerge.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
on the other side of complexity.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
the better chance you have of zooming in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
on the simple details that matter most.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Thank you.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
(Applause)
