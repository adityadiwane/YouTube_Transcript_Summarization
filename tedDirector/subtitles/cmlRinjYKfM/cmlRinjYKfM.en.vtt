00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.260
(Laughter)

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
I was afraid of womanhood.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Not that I'm not afraid now,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but I've learned to pretend.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I've learned to be flexible.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
to help me deal with this fear.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Let me explain.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and pretty and gentle and soft,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and we were supposed to fit into roles

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that were sort of shadowy --

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
(Laughter)

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
There were plenty of role models all around us.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
and of course, the ever-present media

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
bombarding us with images and words,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
telling us how to be.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Now my mother was different.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
She was a homemaker,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
And I just ate it up.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I drew, and I drew,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and not have to perform, not have to speak --

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
I was very shy --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and I could still get approval.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
I was launched as a cartoonist.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Now when we're young,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
but we don't always know --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
we don't perform them right,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
even though we are imprinted at birth

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
with these things,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and we're told

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
what the most important color in the world is.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
(Laughter)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
We're told what to wear --

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
(Laughter)

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
-- and how to do our hair --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.260
(Laughter)

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
-- and how to behave.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Now the rules that I'm talking about

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
are constantly being monitored by the culture.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
We're being corrected,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and the primary policemen are women,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
because we are the carriers of the tradition.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
We pass it down from generation to generation.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Not only that --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
we always have this vague notion

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
that something's expected of us.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And on top of all off these rules,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
they keep changing.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Laughter)

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
We don't know what's going on half the time,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
(Laughter)

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Now if you don't like these rules,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and many of us don't --

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I know I didn't, and I still don't,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
even though I follow them half the time,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
not quite aware that I'm following them --

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
It takes what we know, and it twists it.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and it makes it unexpected,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
and that's what elicits a laugh.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Now what if you put together women and humor?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I think you can get change.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Because women are on the ground floor,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and we know the traditions so well,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
we can bring a different voice to the table.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Now I started drawing

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
in the middle of a lot of chaos.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and I think I was drawing,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
trying to figure out what was going on.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
And then also my family was in chaos,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and I drew to try to bring my family together --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.260
(Laughter)

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
It didn't work.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But I found my place.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
I didn't have to wear pink,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and I could feel like I fit in.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
the little glass ceiling of cartooning,"

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and so I did. I became a cartoonist.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
"Well, why don't I do something?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I always loved political cartoons,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
as well as laugh?"

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Now my perspective

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
is a particularly --

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
(Laughter)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I can't help it. I live here.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Even though I've traveled a lot,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I still think like an American woman.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
are universal, of course --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that each culture has its different codes of behavior

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and dress and traditions,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and each woman has to deal with these same things

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that we do here in the U.S.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Consequently, we have.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
We have amazing antennae.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Now my work lately

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
which I so enjoy,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and it's given me a greater appreciation

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
for the power of cartoons

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to get at the truth,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And not only that, it can get to the viewer

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
My work also has allowed me to collaborate

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
with women cartoonists from across the world --

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
countries such as Saudi Arabia,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Iran, Turkey,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Argentina, France --

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and we have sat together and laughed

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and talked and shared our difficulties.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
in some very difficult circumstances.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And we talk about

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
how women have such strong perceptions,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
because of our tenuous position

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and our role as tradition-keepers,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that we can have the great potential

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
to be change-agents.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And I think, I truly believe,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
that we can change this thing

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
one laugh at a time.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Thank you.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
(Applause)
