00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I want to talk about the election.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
voted for an African-American candidate for President.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
He won 375 electoral votes.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And he won about 70 million popular votes

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
more than any other presidential candidate --

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
of any race, of any party -- in history.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Democrats really like seeing this transition here,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
even states Obama lost, like out west,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
those states became more blue.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
but with a couple of exceptions here and there.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
One exception is in Massachusetts.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
That was John Kerry's home state.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
Obama didn't have much improvement.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton --

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
you see real big differences in this part of the country right here,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.330
the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
20 or 30 point swings

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
in 2008.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
He lost badly but every Democrat does.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
He lost no worse than most people do.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.330
(Laughter)

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
is because we asked those people.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
exit polls in every state,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
in 37 states, out of the 50,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
They asked this question.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
of the candidate a factor?

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
moreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and people who voted for John McCain

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
as a result of that factor,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
We're looking for this behavior among white voters

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
or, really, non-black voters.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
So you see big differences in different parts

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
of the country on this question.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
is because he was an African-American."

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
If those people had voted for Obama,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
admitted, I suppose,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
manifestation of racially-based voting.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
Here is the same data on a map.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
You kind of see the relationship between

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
the redder states of where more people responded and said,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
This really seems to explain

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
why Barack Obama did worse

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
in this one part of the country.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
So we have to ask why.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Is racism predictable in some way?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Is there something driving this?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
that we don't understand, and Kentucky?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
Or are there more systematic factors at work?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time --

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
things like income, and religion, education.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Which of these seem to drive

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
this manifestation of racism

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And there are a couple of these that have

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
strong predictive relationships,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
one of which is education,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
per adult are in red,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
is less educated. It's just a fact.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
And you see the relationship there

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
with the racially-based voting patterns.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
The other variable that's important is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
the type of neighborhood that you live in.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
States that are more rural --

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine --

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
they exhibit a little bit of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
and the type of neighbors that you have,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
which we'll talk about more in a moment.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
is that they're both very rural,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
and they are educationally impoverished.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
So yes, racism is predictable.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
These things, among maybe other variables,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
but these things seem to predict it.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
We're going to drill down a little bit more now,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
into something called the General Social Survey.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
This is conducted by the University of Chicago

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
every other year.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And they ask a series of really interesting questions.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
about racial attitudes.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
One simple question they asked is,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
In cites, about 80 percent of people

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
who are unlike you.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
and split them between those who have black neighbors --

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
or, really, some neighbor of another race --

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and people who have only white neighbors.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
And we see in some variables

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
But you see Democrats versus Republican,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
not a big difference based on who your neighbors are.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
And even some questions about race -- for example

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
affirmative action, which is kind of a political question,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
a policy question about race, if you will --

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
not much difference here.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
feel no differently about it really.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
There is a big difference.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
People who don't have neighbors of a different race

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
are about twice as likely

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.330
"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
It's about who you live with.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.330
interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So if you want to address it,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
ideas for maybe how to do that.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
I'm a big fan of cities.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
So we can think more about things like street grids.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
And you interact a lot with your neighbors --

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
people you like, people you might not know.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
And as a result it's a very tolerant community,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
which is different, I think, than something like this,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
which is in Schaumburg, Illinois,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
I think that actually this type of urban design,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s --

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
more conservative under Ronald Reagan.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
But also here is another idea we have --

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
is an intercollegiate exchange program

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
where you have students going from New York abroad.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
and might never interact in a positive affirmative way

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.330
with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
I think part of the education variable we talked about before

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
is the networking experience you get when you go to college

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.330
where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
But the point is, this is all good news,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
because when something is predictable,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
it is what I call designable.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
If we understand the root causes of the behavior

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
we can start to design solutions to it.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.330
