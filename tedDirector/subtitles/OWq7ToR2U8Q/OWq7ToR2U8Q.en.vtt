00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.246
Now, I've been making pictures
for quite a long time,

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:17.638
and normally speaking,
a picture like this, for me,

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.565
should be straightforward.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.421
I'm in southern Ethiopia.
I'm with the Daasanach.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.532
There's a big family,
there's a very beautiful tree,

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:28.110
and I make these pictures
with this very large,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.871
extremely cumbersome, very awkward
technical plate film camera.

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.331
Does anybody know
4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:38.860
and you're setting it up,
putting it on the tripod.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.715
I've got the family, spent the better part
of a day talking with them.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:44.731
They sort of understand what I'm on about.

00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.239
They think I'm a bit crazy,
but that's another story.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.609
And what's most important for me
is the beauty and the aesthetic,

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.861
and that's based on the light.

00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.462
So the light's setting
on my left-hand side,

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:59.096
and there's a balance
in the communication with the Daasanach,

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.640
the family of 30, all ages.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.577
There's babies and there's grandparents,

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:05.543
I'm getting them in the tree
and waiting for the light to set,

00:01:05.543 --> 00:01:08.632
and it's going, going,
and I've got one sheet of film left,

00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.173
and I think, I'm okay,
I'm in control, I'm in control.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:14.745
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
and the light's just about to go,

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.426
and I want it to be golden,
I want it to be beautiful.

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:20.472
I want it to be hanging on the horizon
so it lights these people,

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.102
in all the potential glory
that they could be presented.

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:25.151
And it's about to go 
and it's about to go,

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.776
and I put my sheet in the camera,

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:27.628
it's all focused,

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:29.913
and all of a sudden
there's a massive "whack,"

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:32.687
and I'm looking around,
and in the top corner of the tree,

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.766
one of the girls slaps
the girl next to her,

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.556
and the girl next to her pulls her hair,
and all hell breaks loose,

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.290
and I'm standing there going,
"But the light, the light.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.580
Wait, I need the light.
Stay still! Stay still!"

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.780
And they start screaming,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.964
and then one of the men turns around
and starts screaming, shouting,

00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:51.397
and the whole tree collapses,
not the tree, but the people in the tree.

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:55.017
They're all running around screaming,
and they run back off into the village

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:58.799
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm
left there standing behind my tripod.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.146
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,
and I can't make the picture.

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:04.170
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.032
It took me a week, it took me a week to
make the picture which you see here today,

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:11.071
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.734
It's very, very, very simple --
I spent a week going around the village,

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.803
and I went to every single one:
"Hello, can you meet at the tree?

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.592
What's your story? Who are you?"

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:22.837
And it all turned out to be
about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:24.920
I mean, I have teenage kids.
I should know.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.593
It was about a boyfriend. The girl
on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,

00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:30.231
and they'd started having a fight.

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.028
And there was a very, very beautiful
lesson for me in that:

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.240
If I was going to photograph these people

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.784
in the dignified, respectful way
that I had intended,

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:40.297
and put them on a pedestal,
I had to understand them.

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:43.587
It wasn't just about turning up.
It wasn't just about shaking a hand.

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:46.642
It wasn't about just saying,
"I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.812
I had to get to know
every single one of them,

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:52.085
right down to whose boyfriend is who
and who is allowed to kiss who.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:53.971
So in the end, a week later,

00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:55.472
and I was absolutely exhausted,

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:58.243
I mean on my knees going,
"Please get back up in that tree.

00:02:58.243 --> 00:02:59.766
It's a picture I need to make."

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:02.455
They all came back.
I put them all back up in the tree.

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:04.765
I made sure the girls
were in the right position,

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.930
and the ones that slapped,
one was over there.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.488
They did look at each other.
If you look at it later,

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.952
they're staring
at each other very angrily,

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:13.943
and I've got the tree and everything,

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.598
and then at the last minute, I go,
"The goat, the goat!

00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.307
I need something for the eye to look at.
I need a white goat in the middle."

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:22.896
So I swapped all the goats around.
I put the goats in.

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:26.507
But even then I got it wrong, because
if you can see on the left-hand side,

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:29.594
another little boy storms off
because I didn't choose his goat.

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:32.948
So the moral being I have to learn
to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.461
But anyway, the effort
that goes into that picture

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.555
and the story that I've
just related to you,

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.563
as you can imagine,

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:41.099
there are hundreds of other
bizarre, eccentric stories

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.241
of hundreds of other people
around the world.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.723
And this was about four years ago,
and I set off on a journey,

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:48.744
to be honest, a very indulgent journey.

00:03:48.744 --> 00:03:53.959
I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist,
perhaps in some ways naive.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.752
But I truly believe that there are people
on the planet that are beautiful.

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:00.500
It's very, very simple.
It's not rocket science.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.512
I wanted to put
these people on a pedestal.

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:05.995
I wanted to put them on a pedestal
like they'd never been seen before.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:10.022
So, I chose about 35 different groups,

00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:11.901
tribes, indigenous cultures.

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.517
They were chosen purely
because of their aesthetic,

00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:16.374
and I'll talk more about that later.

00:04:16.374 --> 00:04:19.950
I'm not an anthropologist, I have
no technical study with the subject,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.852
but I do have a very,
very, very deep passion,

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:26.324
and I believe that I had to choose
the most beautiful people on the planet

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:28.910
in the most beautiful
environment that they lived in,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.215
and put the two together
and present them to you.

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:33.289
About a year ago,

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.402
I published the first pictures,

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:39.419
and something extraordinarily
exciting happened.

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.973
The whole world came running,

00:04:40.973 --> 00:04:44.298
and it was a bizarre experience,
because everybody, from everywhere:

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:46.629
"Who are they? What are they?
How many are they?

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.189
Where did you find them?
Are they real? You faked it.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.619
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."
Millions of questions for which,

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:54.743
to be honest, I don't have the answers.

00:04:54.743 --> 00:04:56.423
I really didn't have the answers,

00:04:56.423 --> 00:05:00.246
and I could sort of understand, okay,
they're beautiful, that was my intention,

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:02.313
but the questions that I
was being fired at,

00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:04.356
I could not answer them.

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:07.189
Until, it was quite amusing,
about a year ago

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.840
somebody said, "You've been
invited to do a TED Talk."

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.464
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?
I haven't met Ted before."

00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:16.021
He said, "No, a TED Talk."
I said, "But who's Ted?

00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.343
Do I have to talk to him or do we
sit with each other on the stage?"

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:22.480
And, "No, no, the TED group.
You must know about it."

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.095
And I said, "I've been in a teepee
and in a yurt for the last five years.

00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:28.428
How do I know who Ted is?
Introduce me to him."

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:31.767
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:33.666
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.140
And then eventually you're going
to go to TEDGlobal.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.274
Even more exciting.

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:40.298
But what you need to do, you need
to teach the people lessons,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:43.350
lessons that you've learned
on your travels around the world

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.280
with these tribes.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.580
I thought, lessons, okay, well,
what did I learn? Good question.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.886
Three. You need three lessons,
and they need to be terribly profound.

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:52.804
(Laughter)

00:05:52.804 --> 00:05:55.947
And I thought, three lessons, well,
I'm going to think about it.

00:05:55.947 --> 00:06:00.093
(Applause)

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.540
So I thought long and hard,
and I stood here two days ago,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.505
and I had my test run,
and I had my cards

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.449
and my clicker in my hands
and my pictures were on the screen,

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.169
and I had my three lessons,
and I started presenting them,

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.563
and I had this very odd
out-of-body experience.

00:06:14.563 --> 00:06:17.417
I sort of looked at myself
standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.233
this is complete loads of codswallop.

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:22.417
All these people sitting here,
they've had more of these talks,

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.421
they've heard more lessons in their life.

00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:26.573
Who are you to tell them
what you've learned?

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.216
Who are you to guide them
and who are you to show them

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:32.171
what is right, what is wrong,
what these people have to say?"

00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:34.452
And I had a little bit of a,
it was very private,

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:35.770
a little bit of a meltdown.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.907
I went back, and a little bit like the boy
walking away from the tree with his goats,

00:06:39.907 --> 00:06:43.158
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,

00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:45.433
It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:49.035
And I thought long and hard about it,
and I thought, well, the only thing

00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:50.888
I can communicate is very, very basic.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.775
You have to turn it all the way around.

00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:56.153
There's only one person
I know here, and that's me.

00:06:56.153 --> 00:06:57.895
I'm still getting to know myself,

00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:01.330
and it's a lifelong journey, and I
probably won't have all the answers,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.440
but I did learn some extraordinary
things on this journey.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.597
So what I'm going to do
is share with you my lessons.

00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:12.323
It's a very, as I explained at the
beginning, very indulgent, very personal,

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:14.654
how and why I made these pictures,

00:07:14.654 --> 00:07:17.889
and I leave it to you as the audience
to interpret what these lessons

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.537
have meant to me, what they could
perhaps mean to you.

00:07:22.377 --> 00:07:25.092
I traveled enormously as a child.

00:07:25.092 --> 00:07:27.613
I was very nomadic.
It was actually very exciting.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.424
All around the world,

00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:33.300
and I had this feeling that I
was pushed off at great speed

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.763
to become somebody,
become that individual, Jimmy.

00:07:35.763 --> 00:07:38.161
Go off into the planet,
and so I ran, and I ran,

00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:41.671
and my wife sometimes kids me,
"Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"

00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:44.008
but I'm, "No, it's all
about something, trust me."

00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:47.171
So I kept running and I kept running,
and I sort of got somewhere

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.342
and I sort of stood there and looked
around me and I thought, well,

00:07:50.342 --> 00:07:52.201
where do I belong? Where do I fit?

00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:55.513
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.

00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:58.590
So I hope there aren't too many
psychologists in this audience.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.980
Perhaps part of this journey

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.103
is about me trying to find out
where I belonged.

00:08:03.103 --> 00:08:07.200
So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't
when I arrived with these tribes,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.974
I didn't paint myself yellow and run
around with these spears and loincloths.

00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:13.900
But what I did find were people
that belonged themselves,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.570
and they inspired me,
some extraordinary people,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.380
and I'd like to introduce you
to some heroes of mine.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.272
They're the Huli.

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:25.382
Now, the Huli are some of the most
extraordinarily beautiful people

00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:26.659
on the planet.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:30.631
They're proud. They live in
the Papua New Guinean highlands.

00:08:30.631 --> 00:08:33.730
There's not many of them left,
and they're called the Huli wigmen.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.808
And images like this, I mean,
this is what it's all about for me.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:40.298
And you've spent weeks and months there
talking with them, getting there,

00:08:40.298 --> 00:08:43.547
and I want to put them on a pedestal,
and I said, "You have something

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:45.080
that many people have not seen.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.735
You sit in this stunning nature."

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:50.016
And it really does look like this,
and they really do look like this.

00:08:50.016 --> 00:08:51.217
This is the real thing.

00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:54.271
And you know why they're proud?
You know why they look like this,

00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:56.064
and why I broke my back literally

00:08:56.064 --> 00:08:58.238
to photograph them
and present them to you?

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.740
It's because they have
these extraordinary rituals.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.263
And the Huli have this ritual:
When they're teenagers,

00:09:03.263 --> 00:09:06.140
becoming a man,
they have to shave their heads,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.262
and they spend the rest of their life
shaving their heads every single day,

00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:12.226
and what they do with that hair,

00:09:12.226 --> 00:09:14.130
they make it into a creation,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.126
a creation that's
a very personal creation.

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:18.379
It's their creation.
It's their Huli creation.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:20.422
So they're called the Huli wigmen.

00:09:20.422 --> 00:09:22.279
That's a wig on his head.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:24.035
It's all made out of his human hair.

00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:27.573
And then they decorate that wig with
the feathers of the birds of paradise,

00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:29.821
and don't worry,
there are many birds there.

00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:33.033
There's very few people living,
so nothing to get too upset about,

00:09:33.033 --> 00:09:35.940
and they spend the rest of their life
recreating these hats

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.494
and getting further
and further,

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.898
and it's extraordinary,
and there's another group,

00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:42.930
they're called the Kalam,
and they live in the next valley,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.148
but they speak a completely
different language,

00:09:45.148 --> 00:09:47.620
they look completely different,
and they wear a hat,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.217
and it's built out of scarabs,

00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:51.530
these fantastic emerald green
little scarabs,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.637
and sometimes there are 5,000
or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,

00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:57.680
and they spend the whole of their life
collecting these scarabs

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.698
to build these hats.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:02.622
So the Huli inspired me
in that they belong.

00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:06.198
Perhaps I have to work harder
at finding a ritual which matters for me

00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:10.679
and going back into my past
to see where I actually fit.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:13.349
An extremely important part
of this project

00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:19.270
was about how I photograph
these extraordinary people.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.660
And it's basically beauty.
I think beauty matters.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.120
We spend the whole of our existence
revolving around beauty:

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.788
beautiful places, beautiful things,
and ultimately, beautiful people.

00:10:29.788 --> 00:10:31.808
It's very, very, very significant.

00:10:31.808 --> 00:10:34.595
I've spent all of my life analyzing
what do I look like?

00:10:34.595 --> 00:10:36.332
Am I perceived as beautiful?

00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:38.705
Does it matter if I'm
a beautiful person or not,

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.678
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?

00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:43.604
And then when I went off,
I came to a very narrow conclusion.

00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:47.156
Do I have to go around the world
photographing, excuse me,

00:10:47.156 --> 00:10:50.954
women between the age of 25 and 30?
Is that what beauty is going to be?

00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:54.409
Is everything before and after that
utterly irrelevant?

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:56.653
And it was only until I went on a journey,

00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:59.440
a journey that was so extreme,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.048
I still get shivers when I think about it.

00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:05.197
I went to a part of the world,
and I don't know whether any of you

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:08.402
have ever heard of Chukotka.
Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:12.929
Chukotka probably is, technically,
as far as one can go

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:16.691
and still be on the living planet.

00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:18.757
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:22.605
First you've got to get to Moscow, and
then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:25.326
And that's if you get there.

00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:27.851
As you can see, some people
sort of miss the runway.

00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:30.860
And then when you land there,
in Chukotka are the Chukchis.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.151
Now, the Chukchis are the last
indigenous Inuits of Siberia,

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:37.344
and they're people I'd heard about,
I'd hardly seen any images of,

00:11:37.344 --> 00:11:38.740
but I knew they were there,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.734
and I'd been in touch with this guide,

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:41.773
and this guide said,

00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:44.810
"There's this fantastic tribe.
There's only about 40 of them.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.000
You'll be okay. We'll find them."
So off we went on this journey.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.062
When we arrived there, after a month
of traveling across the ice,

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:54.386
and we'd got to them, but then
I was not allowed to photograph them.

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:56.955
They said, "You cannot photograph us.
You have to wait.

00:11:56.955 --> 00:12:01.138
You have to wait until you get to know us.
You have to wait until you understand us.

00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:04.264
You have to wait until you see
how we interact with one another."

00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:07.202
And only then, it was many,
many weeks later, I saw a respect.

00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:08.736
They had zero judgment.

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:12.334
They observed one another, from the youth,
from the middle aged to the old.

00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:14.600
They need each other.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.630
The children need to chew the meat all day

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.779
because the adults don't have any teeth,

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:21.737
but at the same time, the children
take the old aged people out

00:12:21.737 --> 00:12:23.707
to the toilet because they're infirm,

00:12:23.707 --> 00:12:25.992
so there's this fantastic
community of respect.

00:12:25.992 --> 00:12:29.750
And they adore and admire one another,
and they truly taught me

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.513
what beauty was.

00:12:31.513 --> 00:12:34.113
(Applause)

00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:37.061
Now I'm going to ask for a little bit
of audience interaction.

00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:39.618
This is extremely important
for the end of my talk.

00:12:39.618 --> 00:12:42.249
If you could look at somebody
left to the right of you,

00:12:42.249 --> 00:12:44.233
and I want you to observe them,

00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:47.411
and I want you to give them a compliment.
This is very important.

00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.434
Now, it may be their nose or their hair
or even their aura, I don't mind,

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:54.477
but please look at each other,
give them a compliment.

00:12:54.477 --> 00:12:57.170
You have to be quick,
because I'm running out of time.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.140
And you have to remember it.

00:13:01.768 --> 00:13:05.970
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you,
you've given each other compliments.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.546
Hold that compliment very, very tightly.
Hold it for later.

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:13.980
And the last thing, it was
extraordinarily profound,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.659
and it happened only two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:20.763
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia
on the border of Angola,

00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:22.690
and I'd been there a few times before,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.039
and I'd gone back
to present this book I'd made,

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:27.960
to show them the pictures,
to get into a discussion with them,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.830
to say, "This is how I saw you.
This is how I love you.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.143
This is how I respect you. What
do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"

00:13:34.143 --> 00:13:37.216
So I wanted this debate.
It was very, very, very emotional,

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.657
and one night we were sitting
around the campfire,

00:13:39.657 --> 00:13:43.279
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
a little bit too much to drink,

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:46.826
and I was sort of sitting under the stars
going, "This is great,

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.450
you've seen my pictures,
we love each other." (Laughter)

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.592
And I'm a little bit slow,

00:13:52.592 --> 00:13:54.503
and I looked around me, and I said,

00:13:54.503 --> 00:13:56.805
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.

00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:58.900
Wasn't there a fence here
last time I came?

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.958
You know, this big
protective fence around the village,

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.672
and they sort of looked at me
and go, "Yeah, chief die."

00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:07.138
And I thought, okay,
chief dying, right, you know,

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:09.529
look up at the stars again,
look at the campfire.

00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:13.399
Chief die. What on Earth does
chief die have to do with the fence?

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:16.416
"Chief die.

00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:18.854
First we destroy, yeah?
Then we reflect.

00:14:18.854 --> 00:14:22.708
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:26.656
And I burst out in tears, because
my father had only just died

00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.490
prior to this journey,

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.161
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.120
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact
that I'm probably standing here today

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.233
because of him.

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:41.259
These people taught me that we are only
who we are because of our parents

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:43.535
and our grandparents
and our forefathers

00:14:43.535 --> 00:14:45.346
going on and on and on before that,

00:14:45.346 --> 00:14:49.432
and I, no matter how romantic
or how idealistic I am on this journey,

00:14:49.432 --> 00:14:51.789
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.738
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

00:14:54.738 --> 00:14:57.519
So what's this all about?

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.776
Well, there's an image
I'd like to show you,

00:14:59.776 --> 00:15:03.505
quite a special image, and it wasn't
essentially the image I wanted to choose.

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:07.303
I was sitting there the other day,
and I have to finish on a strong image.

00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:11.162
And somebody said, "You have to show
them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."

00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:13.830
I was like, yeah, but that's not
my favorite picture.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.528
She went, "No no no no no no no.
It's an amazing picture.

00:15:16.528 --> 00:15:17.581
You're in his eyes."

00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:21.120
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes?
It's a picture of the Nenets."

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.709
She said, "No, look, look closely,
you're in his eyes."

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:27.871
And when you look closely at this picture,
there is a reflection of me in his eyes,

00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:31.260
so I think perhaps he has my soul,
and I'm in his soul,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.438
and whilst these pictures look at you,
I ask you to look at them.

00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:37.126
You may not be reflected in his eyes,

00:15:37.126 --> 00:15:40.502
but there is something extraordinarily
important about these people.

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:44.570
I don't ultimately have the answers,
as I've just shared with you,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.818
but you must do.
There must be something there.

00:15:46.818 --> 00:15:50.440
So if you can briefly reflect
on what I was discussing

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.641
about beauty and about belonging
and about our ancestors and our roots,

00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:59.123
and I need you all
to stand for me, please.

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:01.068
(Laughter)

00:16:01.068 --> 00:16:03.368
Now you have no excuse.
It's almost lunchtime,

00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:05.902
and this is not a standing ovation,
so don't worry,

00:16:05.902 --> 00:16:07.784
I'm not fishing for compliments.

00:16:07.784 --> 00:16:10.384
But you were given a compliment
a few minutes ago.

00:16:10.384 --> 00:16:12.711
Now I want you to stand tall.

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.895
I want you to breathe in.
This is what I say.

00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:17.236
I'm not going to get
on my knees for two weeks.

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:19.324
I'm not going to ask you
to carry a goat,

00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:21.345
and I know you don't have any camels.

00:16:21.345 --> 00:16:23.219
Photography's extraordinarily powerful.

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:25.407
It's this language which
we now all understand.

00:16:25.407 --> 00:16:27.264
We truly do all understand it,

00:16:27.264 --> 00:16:29.749
and we have this global
digital fireplace, don't we,

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:31.720
but I want to share you with the world,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.185
because you are also a tribe.

00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:36.493
You are the TED tribe, yeah?
But you have to remember that compliment.

00:16:36.493 --> 00:16:39.734
You have to stand tall,
breathe in through your nose,

00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:41.702
and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?

00:16:41.702 --> 00:16:44.646
I need to do a panoramic shot,
so it's going to take a minute,

00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:46.227
so you have to concentrate, okay?

00:16:46.227 --> 00:16:49.496
Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing.
Shh, breathe through your nose.

00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:50.950
I'm going to photograph.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.682
(Clicks)
