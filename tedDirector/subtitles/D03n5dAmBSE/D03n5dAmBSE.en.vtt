00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
By the end of this year,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that actively use social networking sites.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The one thing that all of them have in common

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
is that they're going to die.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
I think it has some really profound implications

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
that are worth exploring.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
What first got me thinking about this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
who was a science and technology journalist

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
who died of cancer.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that went out shortly after he died.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and this is my last post to my blog.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
from the punishments of my cancer,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
the first part of the process

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
of turning this from an active website to an archive."

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Now, while as a journalist,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Miller's archive may have been better written

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and more carefully curated than most,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
the fact of the matter is that all of us today

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
are creating an archive

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
that's something completely different

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
than anything that's been created

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
by any previous generation.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Consider a few stats for a moment.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Right now there are 48 hours of video

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And the average Facebook user

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
is creating 90 pieces of content each month.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
at best they may have created

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
some photos or home videos,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
years after we're gone.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
for technologists.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
so what I'd like to do briefly

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
is paint a picture

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
of what the present and the future are going to look like.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Now we're already seeing some services

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that are designed to let us decide

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
after we die.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
One of them actually, fittingly enough,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
found me when I checked into a deli

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
at a restaurant in New York

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
on foursquare.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Death: Adam?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
AO: Yeah.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
even at the Organic.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
AO: Who is this?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Death: Go to ifidie.net

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
before it's too late.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
(Laughter)

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
So what that service does, quite simply,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
is let you create a message or a video

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that can be posted to Facebook after you die.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Another service right now

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
is called 1,000 Memories.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
complete with photos and videos and stories

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
that they can post after you die.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
who, back in March,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I think as machines' ability

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to understand human language and process vast amounts of data

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
continues to improve,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
it's going to become possible

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to analyze an entire life's worth of content --

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
that we're producing in such massive numbers.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And I think as that happens,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
it's going to become possible for our digital personas

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and technology's ability to make sense of it all.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
One service called My Next Tweet

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to make some predictions as to what you might say next.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Well right now, as you can see,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
the results can be somewhat comical.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
You can imagine what something like this might look like

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
five, 10 or 20 years from now

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
as our technical capabilities improve.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Taking it a step further,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
MIT's media lab is working on robots

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that can interact more like humans.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
But what if those robots were able to interact

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
based on the unique characteristics of a specific person

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that person produces in their lifetime?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Finally, think back to this famous scene

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
from election night 2008

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
back in the United States,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
where CNN beamed a live hologram

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
for an interview with Anderson Cooper.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
What if we were able to use that same type of technology

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.260
to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
interacting in a very lifelike way

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
based on all the content they created while they were alive?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
I think that's going to become completely possible

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
as the amount of data we're producing

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and technology's ability to understand it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
both expand exponentially.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
is if we want that to become our reality --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and if so,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Thank you very much.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
(Applause)
