00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:18.051
I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.616
to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.968
and that was mainly because my mother has never believed

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:26.645
in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.200
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.341
I was literally waiting by the mailbox

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.029
to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone,

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.417
which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:41.762
but I was just looking for some sort of scribble,

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:44.393
some unkempt cursive from my mother.

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:46.798
And so when I moved to New York City after college

00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:49.758
and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.510
I did the only thing I could think of at the time.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.522
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.935
for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:01.778
dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:05.980
in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.035
I blogged about those letters and the days

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.009
when they were necessary, and I posed

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.672
a kind of crazy promise to the Internet:

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.058
that if you asked me for a hand-written letter,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.379
I would write you one, no questions asked.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.455
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak --

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:25.146
a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:29.066
in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.712
who barely even knew her own coffee order,

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:34.258
to write them a love letter and give them a reason

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:36.587
to wait by the mailbox.

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:39.411
Well, today I fuel a global organization

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.087
that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,

00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:44.717
fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media

00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:48.207
like never before to write and mail strangers letters

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:51.064
when they need them most, but most of all,

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:54.360
fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.600
filled with the scriptings of ordinary people,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.301
strangers writing letters to other strangers not because

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.092
they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:07.704
but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:09.218
But, you know, the thing that always gets me

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:12.754
about these letters is that most of them have been written

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:17.458
by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:21.163
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.

00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:23.032
They're the ones from my generation,

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.898
the ones of us that have grown up into a world

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:28.981
where everything is paperless, and where some

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.043
of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:34.401
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,

00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.691
and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.363
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.192
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:46.598
which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.

00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:48.907
If you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.740
And a man just stared at me, and he was like,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.229
"Well, why don't you use the Internet?"

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.702
And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist,

00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:01.468
nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:04.149
And so I could tell you about a woman

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.059
whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.605
and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,

00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:13.065
and so she tucks love letters throughout the house

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:15.193
as a way to say, "Come back to me.

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:16.751
Find me when you can."

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.673
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters

00:03:19.673 --> 00:03:22.932
around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:25.985
her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.120
onto the quad and finds love letters hanging

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.233
from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:35.266
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life,

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:38.405
uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:39.758
to friends and family.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:42.328
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:45.545
just like this one tucked beneath his pillow,

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:48.864
scripted by strangers who were there for him when.

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:51.229
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.075
that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair

00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:57.680
and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.073
all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing,

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.611
the doodles in the margins.

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.745
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down,

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.412
pull out a piece of paper and think about someone

00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:11.058
the whole way through, with an intention that is so much

00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:14.288
harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:17.815
is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:19.250
that is an art form

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.425
that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster,"

00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:25.297
no matter how many social networks we might join.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:28.142
We still clutch close these letters to our chest,

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:30.776
to the words that speak louder than loud,

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:33.133
when we turn pages into palettes to say the things

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.699
that we have needed to say,

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.387
the words that we have needed to write, to sisters

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:40.909
and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.475
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:47.722
(Applause)
