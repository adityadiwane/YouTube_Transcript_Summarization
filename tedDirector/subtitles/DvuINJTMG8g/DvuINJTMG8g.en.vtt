00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.720
(Music)

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.776
I went down

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.120
to St. James Infirmary

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.400
To see my baby there

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.080
She was lying on a long wooden table

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.440
So cold, so still, so fair

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.400
I went up to see the doctor

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.000
"She's very low," he said

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.760
I went back to see my baby

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.295
Good God

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.840
she's lying there dead

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.400
I went down to old Joe's bar room

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.800
On the corner of the square

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.016
They were serving drinks as per usual

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.800
And the usual crowd was there

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.040
To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.880
His eyes were bloodshot red

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.880
He turned to the crowd around him

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.600
And these are the words he said

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.520
"Let her go, let her go, God bless her

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.160
Wherever she may be

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.080
She can search
this whole wide world all over

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.760
But she'll never find another man like me

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.416
She can search
this whole wide world all over

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.360
And she'll never find

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.959
another man

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.320
like me

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.400
When I die, please God, bury me

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.640
In my ten-dollar Stetson hat

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.696
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece
on my watch chain

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.040
So my friends know I died standing pat

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.120
Get six gamblers to carry my coffin

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.336
And six choir girls to sing me a song

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.696
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.080
To raise hell as I go along

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.520
Now that's the end of my story

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.200
Let's have another round of booze

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.600
And if anyone should ask you

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.096
Just tell them I got

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.240
the St. James Infirmary

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.760
blues

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.800
(Applause)
