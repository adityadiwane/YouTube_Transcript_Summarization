00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.635
Well, as many of you know,

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.041
the results of the recent
election were as follows:

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.596
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.516
won a landslide victory

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.620
with 52 percent of the overall vote.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.596
Jill Stein, the Green candidate,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.220
came a distant second, with 19 percent.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.356
Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.660
was hot on her heels with 14 percent,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.916
and the remainder of the vote
were shared between abstainers

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.980
and Gary Johnson,
the Libertarian candidate.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.650
(Laughter)

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.100
Now, what parallel universe
do you suppose I live in?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.596
Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.420
I live in the world,
and that is how the world voted.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.620
So let me take you back
and explain what I mean by that.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.836
In June this year,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.020
I launched something
called the Global Vote.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.700
And the Global Vote
does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.116
For the first time in history,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.876
it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
vote in the elections
of other people's countries.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.146
Now, why would you do that?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.556
What's the point?

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.916
Well, let me show you what it looks like.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.340
You go to a website,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.906
rather a beautiful website,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.476
and then you select an election.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.540
Here's a bunch that we've already covered.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.916
We do about one a month, or thereabouts.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.756
So you can see Bulgaria,
the United States of America,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.276
Secretary-General of the United Nations,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.236
the Brexit referendum at the end there.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.036
You select the election
that you're interested in,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.316
and you pick the candidates.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.276
These are the candidates
from the recent presidential election

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.396
in the tiny island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.796
199,000 inhabitants,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.201
off the coast of West Africa.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.836
And then you can look at the brief summary
of each of those candidates

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.356
which I dearly hope is very neutral,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.196
very informative and very succinct.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.540
And when you've found
the one you like, you vote.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.996
These were the candidates

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.876
in the recent Icelandic
presidential election,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.186
and that's the way it goes.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.460
So why on earth would you want to vote
in another country's election?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.636
Well, the reason
that you wouldn't want to do it,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.876
let me reassure you,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.796
is in order to interfere in the democratic
processes of another country.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.476
That's not the purpose at all.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.916
In fact, you can't,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.396
because usually what I do
is I release the results

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.956
after the electorate in each
individual country has already voted,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.796
so there's no way that we could
interfere in that process.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.196
But more importantly,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.796
I'm not particularly interested

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.076
in the domestic issues
of individual countries.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.660
That's not what we're voting on.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.436
So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton
proposed to do for the Americans

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.476
is frankly none of our business.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.516
That's something that only
the Americans can vote on.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.076
No, in the global vote,
you're only considering one aspect of it,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.300
which is what are those leaders
going to do for the rest of us?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.956
And that's so very important
because we live,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.396
as no doubt you're sick
of hearing people tell you,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.660
in a globalized, hyperconnected,
massively interdependent world

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.436
where the political decisions
of people in other countries

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.676
can and will have an impact on our lives

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.940
no matter who we are,
no matter where we live.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.116
Like the wings of the butterfly

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.436
beating on one side of the Pacific

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.996
that can apparently create
a hurricane on the other side,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.676
so it is with the world
that we live in today

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.396
and the world of politics.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.620
There is no longer a dividing line between
domestic and international affairs.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.156
Any country, no matter how small,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.236
even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.796
could produce the next Nelson Mandela

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.020
or the next Stalin.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.436
They could pollute the atmosphere
and the oceans, which belong to all of us,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.380
or they could be responsible
and they could help all of us.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.516
And yet, the system is so strange

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.236
because the system hasn't caught up
with this globalized reality.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.476
Only a small number of people
are allowed to vote for those leaders,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.556
even though their impact is gigantic

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.780
and almost universal.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.276
What number was it?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.836
140 million Americans voted

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.116
for the next president
of the United States,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.075
and yet, as all of us knows,
in a few weeks time,

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.716
somebody is going to hand over
the nuclear launch codes

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.940
to Donald J. Trump.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.356
Now, if that isn't having
a potential impact on all of us,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.580
I don't know what is.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.060
Similarly, the election
for the referendum on the Brexit vote,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.436
a small number of millions
of British people voted on that,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.156
but the outcome of the vote,
whichever way it went,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.876
would have had a significant impact

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.316
on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions
of people around the world.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.220
And yet, only a tiny number could vote.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.260
What kind of democracy is that?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.156
Huge decisions that affect all of us

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.036
being decided by relatively
very small numbers of people.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.396
And I don't know about you,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.580
but I don't think
that sounds very democratic.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.956
So I'm trying to clear it up.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.436
But as I say,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.316
we don't ask about domestic questions.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.396
In fact, I only ever ask two questions
of all of the candidates.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.916
I send them the same
two questions every single time.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.356
I say, one,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.516
if you get elected, what are you
going to do for the rest of us,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.956
for the remainder of the seven billion
who live on this planet?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.916
Second question:

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.156
What is your vision
for your country's future in the world?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.740
What role do you see it playing?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.500
Every candidate,
I send them those questions.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.276
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.076
I reckon if you're standing

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.476
to become the next president
of the United States,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.876
you're probably pretty tied up
most of the time,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.956
so I'm not altogether surprised
that they don't all answer, but many do.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.476
More every time.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.556
And some of them do much more than answer.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.716
Some of them answer in the most
enthusiastic and most exciting way

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.956
you could imagine.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.476
I just want to say a word here
for Saviour Chishimba,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.916
who was one of the candidates

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.196
in the recent Zambian
presidential election.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.756
His answers to those two questions
were basically an 18-page dissertation

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.436
on his view of Zambia's
potential role in the world

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.476
and in the international community.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.940
I posted it on the website
so anybody could read it.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.060
Now, Saviour won the global vote,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.660
but he didn't win the Zambian election.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.516
So I found myself wondering,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.476
what am I going to do
with this extraordinary group of people?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.356
I've got some wonderful people here
who won the global vote.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.076
We always get it wrong, by the way.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.316
The one that we elect

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.220
is never the person who's elected
by the domestic electorate.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.380
That may be partly because
we always seem to go for the woman.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.356
But I think it may also be a sign

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.956
that the domestic electorate
is still thinking very nationally.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.116
They're still thinking very inwardly.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.636
They're still asking themselves:
What's in it for me? ...

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.756
instead of what
they should be asking today,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.540
which is, what's in it for we?

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.036
But there you go.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.196
So suggestions, please, not right now,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.220
but send me an email if you've got an idea

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:14.520
about what we can do
with this amazing team of glorious losers.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.596
(Laughter)

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.076
We've got Saviour Chishimba,
who I mentioned before.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.476
We've got Halla Tómasdóttir,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.396
who was the runner up
in the Icelandic presidential election.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.116
Many of you may have seen
her amazing talk at TEDWomen

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.356
just a few weeks ago

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.956
where she spoke about the need
for more women to get into politics.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.500
We've got Maria das Neves
from São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.956
We've got Hillary Clinton.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.036
I don't know if she's available.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.260
We've got Jill Stein.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.156
And we covered also the election

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.660
for the next Secretary-General
of the United Nations.

00:07:45.285 --> 00:07:47.476
We've got the ex-prime minister
of New Zealand,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.596
who would be a wonderful
member of the team.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.116
So I think maybe those people,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.796
the glorious loser's club,
could travel around the world

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.196
wherever there's an election

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.596
and remind people
of the necessity in our modern age

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.236
of thinking a little bit outwards

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.451
and thinking of
the international consequences.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.156
So what comes next for the global vote?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.956
Well, obviously,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.436
the Donald and Hillary show
is a bit of a difficult one to follow,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.396
but there are some other
really important elections coming up.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.236
In fact, they seem to be multiplying.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.396
There's something going on,
I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.660
And the next row of elections
are all critically important.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.596
In just a few day's time

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.676
we've got the rerun
of the Austrian presidential election,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.476
with the prospect of Norbert Hofer

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.476
becoming what is commonly described

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.980
as the first far-right head of state
in Europe since the Second World War.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.516
Next year we've got Germany,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.756
we've got France,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.916
we've got presidential elections in Iran

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.140
and a dozen others.

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:46.876
It doesn't get less important.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.499
It gets more and more important.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.996
Clearly, the global vote
is not a stand-alone project.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.499
It's not just there on its own.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.836
It has some background.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.876
It's part of a project
which I launched back in 2014,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.460
which I call the Good Country.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.820
The idea of the Good Country
is basically very simple.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.116
It's my simple diagnosis
of what's wrong with the world

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.340
and how we can fix it.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.036
What's wrong with the world
I've already hinted at.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.796
Basically, we face
an enormous and growing number

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.996
of gigantic, existential
global challenges:

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.676
climate change, human rights abuses,

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.900
mass migration, terrorism,
economic chaos, weapons proliferation.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.076
All of these problems
which threaten to wipe us out

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.236
are by their very nature
globalized problems.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.660
No individual country has the capability
of tackling them on its own.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.316
And so very obviously

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.956
we have to cooperate
and we have to collaborate as nations

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.838
if we're going to solve these problems.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.740
It's so obvious, and yet we don't.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.580
We don't do it nearly often enough.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.036
Most of the time,
countries still persist in behaving

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.716
as if they were warring, selfish tribes
battling against each other,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.476
much as they have done
since the nation-state was invented

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.076
hundreds of years ago.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.236
And this has got to change.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.596
This is not a change in political systems
or a change in ideology.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.556
This is a change in culture.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.580
We, all of us, have to understand

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.476
that thinking inwards is not the solution
to the world's problems.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.476
We have to learn how to cooperate
and collaborate a great deal more

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.900
and compete just a tiny bit less.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.396
Otherwise things
are going to carry on getting bad

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.620
and they're going to get much worse,
much sooner than we anticipate.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.476
This change will only happen

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.236
if we ordinary people

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.076
tell our politicians
that things have changed.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.636
We have to tell them
that the culture has changed.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.236
We have to tell them
that they've got a new mandate.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.156
The old mandate
was very simple and very single:

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.356
if you're in a position
of power or authority,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.996
you're responsible for your own people
and your own tiny slice of territory,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.236
and that's it.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.956
And if in order to do
the best thing for your own people,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.036
you screw over everybody else
on the planet, that's even better.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.796
That's considered to be a bit macho.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.196
Today, I think everybody
in a position of power and responsibility

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.836
has got a dual mandate,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.836
which says if you're in a position
of power and responsibility,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.716
you're responsible for your own people

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.980
and for every single man, woman,
child and animal on the planet.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.476
You're responsible
for your own slice of territory

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.196
and for every single square mile
of the earth's surface

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.596
and the atmosphere above it.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.956
And if you don't like that responsibility,
you should not be in power.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.036
That for me is the rule of the modern age,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.436
and that's the message that we've got
to get across to our politicians,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.756
and show them that that's the way
things are done these days.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.460
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.476
I don't have a problem, actually,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.436
with Donald Trump's credo
of "America first."

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.876
It seems to me that that's
a pretty banal statement

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.076
of what politicians have always done
and probably should always do.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.540
Of course they're elected to represent
the interests of their own people.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.276
But what I find so boring
and so old-fashioned

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.036
and so unimaginative
about his take on that

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.580
is that America first
means everyone else last,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.276
that making America great again
means making everybody else small again,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.500
and it's just not true.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.356
In my job as a policy advisor
over the last 20 years or so,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.996
I've seen so many hundreds
of examples of policies

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.556
that harmonize the international
and the domestic needs,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.556
and they make better policy.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.156
I'm not asking nations
to be altruistic or self-sacrificing.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.516
That would be ridiculous.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.940
No nation would ever do that.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.476
I'm asking them to wake up and understand
that we need a new form of governance,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.700
which is possible

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.276
and which harmonizes those two needs,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.340
those good for our own people
and those good for everybody else.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.556
Since the US election and since Brexit

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.956
it's become more and more obvious to me

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.596
that those old distinctions
of left wing and right wing

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.916
no longer make sense.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.580
They really don't fit the pattern.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.876
What does seem to matter today

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.516
is very simple,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.716
whether your view of the world is

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.436
that you take comfort
from looking inwards and backwards,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.180
or whether, like me, you find hope
in looking forwards and outwards.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.556
That's the new politics.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.220
That's the new division that is
splitting the world right down the middle.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.516
Now, that may sound judgmental,
but it's not meant to be.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.476
I don't at all misunderstand

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.620
why so many people find their comfort
in looking inwards and backwards.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.876
When times are difficult,
when you're short of money,

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.996
when you're feeling
insecure and vulnerable,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.516
it's almost a natural
human tendency to turn inwards,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.556
to think of your own needs

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.676
and to discard everybody else's,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.436
and perhaps to start to imagine
that the past was somehow better

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.860
than the present or the future
could ever be.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.996
But I happen to believe
that that's a dead end.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.276
History shows us that it's a dead end.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.436
When people turn inwards
and turn backwards,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.236
human progress becomes reversed

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.820
and things get worse for everybody
very quickly indeed.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.956
If you're like me

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.676
and you believe in forwards and outwards,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.396
and you believe that the best thing
about humanity is its diversity,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.196
and the best thing about globalization

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.516
is the way that it stirs up
that diversity, that cultural mixture

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.556
to make something more creative,
more exciting, more productive

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.516
than there's ever been before
in human history,

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.060
then, my friends,
we've got a job on our hands,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.876
because the inwards and backwards brigade

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.436
are uniting as never before,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.396
and that creed of inwards and backwards,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.980
that fear, that anxiety,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.676
playing on the simplest instincts,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.236
is sweeping across the world.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.196
Those of us who believe,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.956
as I believe, in forwards and outwards,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.860
we have to get ourselves organized,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.540
because time is running out
very, very quickly.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.276
Thank you.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.620
(Applause)
