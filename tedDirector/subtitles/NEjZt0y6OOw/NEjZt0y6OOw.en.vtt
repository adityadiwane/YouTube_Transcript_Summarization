00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:28.515
(Music: "The Sound of Silence,"
Simon &amp; Garfunkel)

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.976
Hello voice mail, my old friend.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.663
(Laughter)

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:36.544
I've called for tech support again.

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:40.173
I ignored my boss's warning.

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:43.513
I called on a Monday morning.

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:49.655
Now it's evening, and my dinner
first grew cold, and then grew mold.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.953
I'm still on hold.

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:57.561
I'm listening to the sounds of silence.

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:00.642
I don't think you understand.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.492
I think your phone lines are unmanned.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:07.788
I punched every touch tone I was told,

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:10.975
but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.976
It's not enough your software
crashed my Mac,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.537
and it constantly hangs and bombs --

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:20.121
it erased my ROMs!

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:24.486
Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:28.642
In my dreams I fantasize

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.241
of wreaking vengeance on you guys.

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:35.740
Say your motorcycle crashes.

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:39.071
Blood comes gushing from your gashes.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:45.678
With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1
and you pray for a trained MD.

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:47.322
But you get me.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:48.789
(Laughter)

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:53.011
And you listen to the sounds of silence.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:55.924
(Music)

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.146
(Applause)

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.321
Thank you.

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:00.693
Good evening and welcome to:

00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:03.705
"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used
to Be a Broadway Accompanist."

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.867
(Laughter)

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.406
When I was offered the Times
column six years ago,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.638
the deal was like this:

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:13.041
you'll be sent the coolest, hottest,
slickest new gadgets.

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.976
Every week, it'll arrive at your door.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.653
You get to try them out,
play with them, evaluate them

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:20.749
until the novelty wears out,
before you have to send them back,

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.100
and you'll get paid for it.

00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:24.622
You can think about it, if you want.

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:29.271
So, I've always been a technology nut,
and I absolutely love it.

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:32.232
The job, though, came with one
small downside, and that is,

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:36.976
they intended to publish my email address
at the end of every column.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.055
And what I've noticed is -- first of all,
you get an incredible amount of email.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.814
If you ever are feeling lonely,

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:46.218
get a New York Times column,

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:49.376
because you will get hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of emails.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.976
And the email I'm getting a lot
today is about frustration.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.349
People are feeling like things --

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.683
Ok, I just had an alarm
come up on my screen.

00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.096
Lucky you can't see it.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.619
People are feeling overwhelmed.

00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:04.263
They're feeling like
it's too much technology, too fast.

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:05.976
It may be good technology,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.988
but I feel like there's not enough
of a support structure.

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:10.594
There's not enough help.

00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:13.064
There's not enough thought
put into the design of it

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:15.018
to make it easy and enjoyable to use.

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:19.030
One time I wrote a column about my efforts
to reach Dell Technical Support,

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:23.143
and within 12 hours,
there were 700 messages

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.358
from readers on the feedback boards
on the Times website,

00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:28.274
from users saying,

00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:30.712
""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:33.122
I call it "software rage."

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.345
And man, let me tell you,

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.792
whoever figures out how to make money
off of this frustration will --

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:41.097
Oh, how did that
get up there? Just kidding.

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.269
(Laughter)

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:45.172
Ok, so why is the problem accelerating?

00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:47.161
And part of the problem is, ironically,

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.280
because the industry
has put so much thought

00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:51.257
into making things easier to use.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:52.882
I'll show you what I mean.

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:57.341
This is what the computer
interface used to look like, DOS.

00:03:57.365 --> 00:04:00.199
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.779
This is the original Mac operating system.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.914
Reagan was President.
Madonna was still a brunette.

00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:07.667
And the entire operating system --

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.851
this is the good part -- the entire
operating system fit in 211 k.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:15.977
You couldn't put
the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.613
(Laughter)

00:04:17.637 --> 00:04:21.440
So the irony is, that as these
things became easier to use,

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:25.320
a less technical, broader audience
was coming into contact

00:04:25.344 --> 00:04:27.289
with this equipment for the first time.

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:32.978
I once had the distinct privilege
of sitting in on the Apple call center

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.162
for a day.

00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.976
The guy had a duplicate headset
for me to listen to.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.526
And the calls that --
you know how they say,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.280
"Your call may be recorded
for quality assurance?"

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:44.573
Uh-uh.

00:04:44.597 --> 00:04:45.976
Your call may be recorded

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.668
so that they can collect
the funniest dumb user stories

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:50.183
and pass them around on a CD.

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:51.247
(Laughter)

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:52.976
Which they do.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.592
(Laughter)

00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:55.838
And I have a copy.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.885
(Laughter)

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.003
It's in your gift bag. No, no.

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:01.198
With your voices on it!

00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:06.381
So, some of the stories are just
so classic, and yet so understandable.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:09.748
A woman called Apple to complain
that her mouse was squeaking.

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:10.994
Making a squeaking noise.

00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:12.188
And the technician said,

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.863
"Well, ma'am, what do you mean
your mouse is squeaking?"

00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:17.530
She says, "All I can tell you
is that it squeaks louder,

00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:20.164
the faster I move it across the screen."

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.259
(Laughter)

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:23.545
And the technician's like,

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.719
"Ma'am, you've got the mouse
up against the screen?"

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.836
She goes, "Well, the message said,
'Click here to continue.'"

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.925
(Laughter)

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.798
Well, if you like that one --
how much time have we got?

00:05:36.822 --> 00:05:39.494
Another one, a guy called --
this is absolutely true --

00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:41.976
his computer had crashed,
and he told the technician

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.194
he couldn't restart it, no matter
how many times he typed "11."

00:05:46.218 --> 00:05:49.368
And the technician said,
"What? Why are you typing 11?"

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:52.976
He said, "The message says,
'Error Type 11.'"

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.375
(Laughter)

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.304
So, we must admit

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:04.232
that some of the blame falls squarely
at the feet of the users.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.976
But why is the technical overload crisis,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.580
the complexity crisis, accelerating now?

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.383
In the hardware world, it's because
we the consumers want

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.591
everything to be smaller,
smaller, smaller.

00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:18.178
So the gadgets are getting
tinier and tinier,

00:06:18.202 --> 00:06:20.805
but our fingers are essentially
staying the same size.

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:22.976
So it gets to be more and more
of a challenge.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.096
Software is subject
to another primal force:

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.709
the mandate to release
more and more versions.

00:06:27.733 --> 00:06:29.329
When you buy a piece of software,

00:06:29.353 --> 00:06:32.241
it's not like buying a vase
or a candy bar, where you own it.

00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:35.633
It's more like joining a club,
where you pay dues every year,

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:36.912
and every year, they say,

00:06:36.936 --> 00:06:40.976
"We've added more features,
and we'll sell it to you for $99."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.976
I know one guy who's spent $4,000
just on Photoshop over the years.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.839
And software companies make
35 percent of their revenue

00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:50.619
from just these software upgrades.

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:53.518
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:57.391
which is that if you improve
a piece of software enough times,

00:06:57.415 --> 00:06:58.910
you eventually ruin it.

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:03.099
I mean, Microsoft Word was last
just a word processor in, you know,

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:04.689
the Eisenhower administration.

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:05.761
(Laughter)

00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:07.148
But what's the alternative?

00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:09.184
Microsoft actually did this experiment.

00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:10.756
They said, "Well, wait a minute.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.328
Everyone complains that
we're adding so many features.

00:07:13.352 --> 00:07:16.151
Let's create a word processor
that's just a word processor:

00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:19.404
Simple, pure; does not do web pages,
is not a database."

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:22.834
And it came out,
and it was called Microsoft Write.

00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.976
And none of you are nodding
in acknowledgment, because it died.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.976
It tanked. No one ever bought it.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.403
I call this the Sport Utility Principle.

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:34.667
People like to surround themselves
with unnecessary power, right?

00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:38.000
They don't need the database
and the website, but they're like,

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:41.976
"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,
you know, I might need that someday."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.558
So the problem is: as you add more
features, where are they going to go?

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:49.722
Where are you going to stick them?
You only have so many design tools.

00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:53.738
You can do buttons, you can do
sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.

00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:56.787
But if you're not careful
about how you choose,

00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:57.976
you wind up with this.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.747
(Laughter)

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.603
This is an un-retouched --
this is not a joke --

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:04.889
un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,

00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:07.747
the copy that you have,
with all the toolbars open.

00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:11.093
You've obviously never
opened all the toolbars,

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:15.859
but all you have to type in
is this little, teeny window down here.

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:18.442
(Laughter)

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:21.911
And we've arrived at the age
of interface matrices,

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:24.077
where there are so many
features and options,

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:26.021
you have to do two dimensions, you know:

00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:27.388
a vertical and a horizontal.

00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:28.569
You guys all complain

00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:31.331
about how Microsoft Word
is always bulleting your lists

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.449
and underlining your links automatically.

00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:36.608
The off switch is in there somewhere.

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:38.211
I'm telling you -- it's there.

00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:41.479
Part of the art of designing
a simple, good interface,

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:44.987
is knowing when to use
which one of these features.

00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:48.536
So, here is the log-off
dialogue box for Windows 2000.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.060
There are only four choices,

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:54.140
so why are they in a pop-up menu?

00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:57.480
It's not like the rest of the screen
is so full of other components

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:59.976
that you need to collapse the choices.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.976
They could have put them all out in view.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.976
Here's Apple's take
on the exact same dialogue box.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.403
(Applause)

00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:09.976
Thank you -- yes, I designed
the dialogue box. No, no.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.615
Already, we can see
that Apple and Microsoft

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.976
have a severely divergent
approach to software design.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:20.132
Microsoft's approach
to simplicity tends to be:

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:22.976
let's break it down;
let's just make it more steps.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.976
There are these "wizards" everywhere.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.239
And you know, there's a new version
of Windows coming out this fall.

00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:31.318
If they continue at this pace,
there's absolutely no telling

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:33.488
where they might wind up.

00:09:33.512 --> 00:09:35.850
[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:37.042
(Laughter)

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:40.356
(Applause)

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.165
"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."

00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:43.404
Ok, I'll bite.

00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:45.976
Let's click "Next" to continue.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.303
(Laughter)

00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:50.174
(Applause)

00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:53.548
From the drop-down menu, choose
the first letter you want to type. Ok.

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:55.905
(Laughter)

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.468
So there is a limit
that we don't want to cross.

00:09:58.492 --> 00:09:59.643
So what is the answer?

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:03.743
How do you pack in all these features
in a simple, intelligent way?

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:06.472
I believe in consistency, when possible,

00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:07.798
real-world equivalents,

00:10:07.822 --> 00:10:11.045
trash can folder, when possible,
label things, mostly.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.245
But I beg of the designers here

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.840
to break all those rules
if they violate the biggest rule of all,

00:10:16.864 --> 00:10:18.053
which is intelligence.

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:19.380
Now what do I mean by that?

00:10:19.404 --> 00:10:21.095
I'm going to give you some examples

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:24.451
where intelligence makes something
not consistent, but it's better.

00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:26.862
If you are buying something on the web,

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:28.767
you're supposed to put in your address,

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:31.625
and you're supposed to choose
what country you're from, ok?

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:33.427
There are 200 countries in the world.

00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:35.959
We like to think of the Internet
as a global village.

00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:37.354
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.

00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:39.982
It's mainly like, the United States,
Europe, and Japan.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.357
So why is "United States" in the "U"s?

00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:43.747
(Laughter)

00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:46.700
You have to scroll, like,
seven screensful to get to it.

00:10:46.724 --> 00:10:49.976
Now, it would be inconsistent
to put "United States" first,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.471
but it would be intelligent.

00:10:51.495 --> 00:10:54.128
This one's been touched on before,

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:57.976
but why in God's name do you
shut down a Windows PC

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.399
by clicking a button called "Start?"

00:11:00.423 --> 00:11:04.491
(Laughter)

00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:07.976
Here's another pet one of mine:
you have a printer.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.869
Most of the time, you want to print
one copy of your document,

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.145
in page order, on that printer.

00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:18.429
So why in God's name do you see
this every time you print?

00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:21.262
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.

00:11:21.286 --> 00:11:22.849
(Laughter)

00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:26.641
And one of the buttons at the bottom,
you'll notice, is not "Print."

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:30.976
(Laughter)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.270
(Applause)

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:38.223
Now, I'm not saying that Apple
is the only company who has embraced

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:40.803
the cult of simplicity.

00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:43.807
Palm is also, especially in the old days,
wonderful about this.

00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:47.189
I actually got to speak to Palm
when they were flying high in the '90s,

00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:49.417
and after the talk,
I met one of the employees.

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:52.622
He says, "Nice talk." And I said,
"Thank you. What do you do here?"

00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:55.287
He said, "I'm a tap counter."
I'm like, "You're a what?"

00:11:55.311 --> 00:11:57.343
He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins,
the CEO, says,

00:11:57.367 --> 00:12:01.576
'If any task on the Palm Pilot
takes more than three taps of the stylus,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.598
it's too long,
and it has to be redesigned.'

00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:05.976
So I'm the tap counter."

00:12:06.414 --> 00:12:08.176
So, I'm going to show you an example

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.822
of a company that does not
have a tap counter.

00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:12.109
(Laughter)

00:12:12.133 --> 00:12:13.704
This is Microsoft Word.

00:12:13.728 --> 00:12:17.862
Ok, when you want to create
a new blank document in Word --

00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:19.038
it could happen.

00:12:19.062 --> 00:12:24.410
(Laughter)

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:27.893
You go up to the "File" menu
and you choose "New."

00:12:27.917 --> 00:12:30.116
Now, what happens when you choose "New?"

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.169
Do you get a new blank document?

00:12:32.193 --> 00:12:33.384
You do not.

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:38.099
On the opposite side of the monitor,
a task bar appears,

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:41.885
and somewhere in those links --
by the way, not at the top --

00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:46.353
somewhere in those links is a button
that makes you a new document.

00:12:46.377 --> 00:12:49.370
Ok, so that is a company
not counting taps.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:53.198
You know, I don't want to just stand
here and make fun of Microsoft ...

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:54.524
Yes, I do.

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:55.976
(Laughter)

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.595
(Applause)

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:00.993
The Bill Gates song!

00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:02.445
(Piano music)

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.904
I've been a geek forever

00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:08.168
and I wrote the very first DOS.

00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:13.703
I put my software and IBM together;

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:16.976
I got profit and they got the loss.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.678
(Laughter)

00:13:19.702 --> 00:13:24.320
I write the code
that makes the whole world run.

00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:28.757
I'm getting royalties from everyone.

00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:33.407
Sometimes it's garbage,
but the press is snowed.

00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:36.000
You buy the box; I'll sell the code.

00:13:39.113 --> 00:13:43.976
Every software company
is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.132
You can't keep a good idea
down these days.

00:13:48.156 --> 00:13:50.335
Even Windows is a hack.

00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:52.685
We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:55.417
So it's big, so it's slow.
You've got nowhere to go.

00:13:55.441 --> 00:13:57.976
I'm not doing this for praise.

00:13:58.642 --> 00:14:02.928
I write the code
that fits the world today.

00:14:03.483 --> 00:14:07.189
Big mediocrity in every way.

00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:11.976
We've entered planet domination mode.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.522
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.

00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:23.000
I am Bill Gates and I write the code.

00:14:25.173 --> 00:14:32.114
(Applause)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.702
But actually, I believe
there are really two Microsofts.

00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:38.805
There's the old one, responsible
for Windows and Office.

00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:42.843
They're dying to throw the whole thing
out and start fresh, but they can't.

00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:46.567
They're locked in, because so many add-ons
and other company stuff

00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.212
locks into the old 1982 chassis.

00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:50.826
But there's also a new Microsoft,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.341
that's really doing good,
simple interface designs.

00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:55.921
I liked the Media Center PC.

00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:57.701
I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.

00:14:57.725 --> 00:15:00.678
The Wireless Watch
flopped miserably in the market,

00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:03.750
but it wasn't because it wasn't
simply and beautifully designed.

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:05.020
But let's put it this way:

00:15:05.044 --> 00:15:07.535
would you pay $10 a month to have a watch

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.817
that has to be recharged
every night like your cell phone,

00:15:10.841 --> 00:15:13.380
and stops working
when you leave your area code?

00:15:13.404 --> 00:15:16.002
(Laughter)

00:15:16.026 --> 00:15:18.527
So, the signs might indicate

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:21.388
that the complexity crunch
is only going to get worse.

00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:23.065
So is there any hope?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.788
The screens are getting smaller,
people are illuminating,

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:27.209
putting manuals in the boxes,

00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:29.976
things are coming out at a faster pace.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.393
It's funny -- when Steve Jobs
came back to Apple in 1997,

00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:36.242
after 12 years away,
it was the MacWorld Expo --

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:39.408
he came to the stage
in that black turtleneck and jeans,

00:15:39.432 --> 00:15:40.584
and he sort of did this.

00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:42.976
The crowd went wild,
but I had just seen --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.926
I'm like, where have I seen this before?

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.759
I had just seen the movie "Evita" --

00:15:46.783 --> 00:15:49.868
(Laughter)

00:15:49.892 --> 00:15:51.050
with Madonna,

00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:52.822
and I'm like, you know what?

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:55.943
I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.

00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:56.975
(Music)

00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:00.015
It won't be easy.
You'll think I'm strange.

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:01.183
(Laughter)

00:16:01.207 --> 00:16:03.516
When I try to explain why I'm back,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.631
after telling the press
Apple's future is black.

00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:09.250
You won't believe me.

00:16:09.274 --> 00:16:13.976
All that you see is a kid in his teens
who started out in a garage

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.976
with only a buddy named Woz.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.552
(Laughter)

00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:20.309
You try rhyming with garage!

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:22.775
(Laughter)

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:25.674
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:27.020
(Laughter)

00:16:27.044 --> 00:16:29.976
The truth is, I never left you.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.535
I know the ropes now,
know what the tricks are.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:36.976
I made a fortune over at Pixar.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.039
(Laughter)

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.714
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.

00:16:41.182 --> 00:16:44.495
I've still got the drive and vision.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:47.971
I still wear sandals in any weather.

00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:49.976
It's just that these days,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.976
they're Gucci leather.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.976
(Laughter)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.908
(Applause)

00:17:01.258 --> 00:17:02.416
Thank you.

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:07.523
So Steve Jobs had always believed
in simplicity and elegance and beauty.

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:09.444
And the truth is,

00:17:09.468 --> 00:17:11.596
for years I was a little depressed,

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.893
because Americans
obviously did not value it,

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:16.194
because the Mac had
three percent market share,

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:18.075
Windows had 95 percent market share --

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.976
people did not think it was worth
putting a price on it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.791
So I was a little depressed.

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:24.372
And then I heard Al Gore's talk,

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:26.935
and I realized I didn't know
the meaning of depressed.

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:27.976
(Laughter)

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.737
But it turns out I was wrong, right?

00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:31.494
Because the iPod came out,

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:34.136
and it violated every bit
of common wisdom.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.136
Other products cost less;
other products had more features,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.897
they had voice recorders
and FM transmitters.

00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:43.143
The other products were backed
by Microsoft, with an open standard,

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:44.881
not Apple's propriety standard.

00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:47.477
But the iPod won --
this is the one they wanted.

00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:49.764
The lesson was: simplicity sells.

00:17:49.788 --> 00:17:52.662
And there are signs that the industry
is getting the message.

00:17:52.686 --> 00:17:56.277
This is a little company that's done
very well with simplicity and elegance.

00:17:56.301 --> 00:17:58.040
The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.

00:17:58.064 --> 00:17:59.762
I've got just a couple examples.

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:03.462
Physically, a really cool,
elegant thinking coming along lately.

00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:05.439
When you have a digital camera,

00:18:05.463 --> 00:18:08.706
how do you get the pictures
back to your computer?

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.072
Well, you either haul around a USB cable,

00:18:11.096 --> 00:18:13.252
or you buy a card reader
and haul that around.

00:18:13.276 --> 00:18:14.863
Either one, you're going to lose.

00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:17.346
What I do is, I take out the memory card,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.715
and I fold it in half,
revealing USB contacts.

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:25.397
I just stick it in the computer,
offload the pictures,

00:18:25.421 --> 00:18:26.960
put it right back in the camera.

00:18:26.984 --> 00:18:28.784
I never have to lose anything.

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:30.345
Here's another example.

00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:33.439
Chris, you're the source of all power.
Will you be my power plug?

00:18:33.463 --> 00:18:36.203
Chris Anderson: Oh yeah.
DP: Hold that and don't let go.

00:18:36.227 --> 00:18:38.648
You might've seen this,
this is Apple's new laptop.

00:18:38.672 --> 00:18:40.696
This the power cord.
It hooks on like this.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.117
And I'm sure every one of you has done
this at some point in your lives,

00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:45.316
or one of your children.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.165
You walk along -- and I'm
about to pull this onto the floor.

00:18:48.189 --> 00:18:49.525
I don't care. It's a loaner.

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:50.732
Here we go. Whoa!

00:18:50.756 --> 00:18:53.825
It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull
the laptop onto the floor.

00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:57.976
(Applause)

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.969
In my very last example --

00:18:59.993 --> 00:19:03.969
I do a lot of my work
using speech recognition software.

00:19:03.993 --> 00:19:06.223
And I'll just --
you have to be kind of quiet

00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:07.850
because the software is nervous.

00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:10.604
Speech recognition
software is really great

00:19:10.628 --> 00:19:13.158
for doing emails very quickly; period.

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:15.821
Like, I get hundreds of them
a day; period.

00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:19.136
And it's not just what I dictate
that it writes down; period.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.350
I also use this feature
called voice macros; period.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.102
Correct "dissuade."

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:30.153
Not "just."

00:19:32.248 --> 00:19:33.930
Ok, this is not an ideal situation,

00:19:33.954 --> 00:19:36.493
because it's getting the echo
from the hall and stuff.

00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:40.753
The point is, I can respond to people
very quickly by saying a short word,

00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:42.849
and having it write out
a much longer thing.

00:19:42.873 --> 00:19:45.239
So if somebody
sends me a fan letter, I'll say,

00:19:45.263 --> 00:19:46.420
"Thanks for that."

00:19:46.444 --> 00:19:48.951
[Thank you so much
for taking the time to write ...]

00:19:48.975 --> 00:19:49.976
(Laughter)

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.976
(Applause)

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.438
And conversely, if somebody
sends me hate mail --

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:59.764
which happens daily --

00:19:59.788 --> 00:20:01.840
I say, "Piss off."

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:05.825
(Laughter)

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:08.321
[I admire your frankness ...]

00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:09.976
(Laughter)

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.353
(Applause)

00:20:15.377 --> 00:20:17.976
So that's my dirty little secret.
Don't tell anyone.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.115
(Laughter)

00:20:19.139 --> 00:20:21.976
So the point is --
this is a really interesting story.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.878
This is version eight of this software,

00:20:23.902 --> 00:20:26.100
and do you know what they put
in version eight?

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:29.186
No new features. It's never
happened before in software!

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.941
The company put no new features.

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:34.580
They just said, "We'll make
this software work right." Right?

00:20:34.604 --> 00:20:37.820
Because for years, people had bought
this software, tried it out --

00:20:37.844 --> 00:20:39.645
95 percent accuracy was all they got,

00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:41.565
which means one in 20 words is wrong --

00:20:41.589 --> 00:20:43.216
and they'd put it in their drawer.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.820
And the company got sick of that,

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:47.680
so they said, "This version,
we're not going to do anything,

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:49.437
but make sure it's darned accurate."

00:20:49.461 --> 00:20:50.810
And so that's what they did.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.422
This cult of doing things right
is starting to spread.

00:20:53.446 --> 00:20:56.942
So, my final advice for those of you
who are consumers of this technology:

00:20:56.966 --> 00:21:00.976
remember, if it doesn't work,
it's not necessarily you, ok?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.334
It could be the design
of the thing you're using.

00:21:03.358 --> 00:21:06.146
Be aware in life
of good design and bad design.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.037
And if you're among the people
who create this stuff:

00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:10.380
Easy is hard.

00:21:10.404 --> 00:21:12.738
Pre-sweat the details for your audience.

00:21:12.762 --> 00:21:13.976
Count the taps.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.943
Remember, the hard part
is not deciding what features to add,

00:21:16.967 --> 00:21:18.736
it's deciding what to leave out.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.957
And best of all, your motivation is:
simplicity sells.

00:21:22.611 --> 00:21:24.278
CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.

00:21:24.302 --> 00:21:25.453
CA: Hear, hear!

00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:27.952
(Applause)
