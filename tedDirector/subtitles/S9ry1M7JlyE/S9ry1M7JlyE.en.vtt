00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:17.224
I'm a potter,

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:21.749
which seems like a fairly humble vocation.

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.629
I know a lot about pots.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.309
I've spent about 15 years making them.

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.339
One of the things that really
excites me in my artistic practice

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.056
and being trained as a potter

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:39.500
is that you very quickly learn
how to make great things out of nothing;

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.283
that I spent a lot of time at my wheel
with mounds of clay trying stuff;

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:49.775
and that the limitations
of my capacity, my ability,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.506
was based on my hands and my imagination;

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.706
that if I wanted to make
a really nice bowl

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.810
and I didn't know how to make a foot yet,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.829
I would have to learn how to make a foot;

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.933
that that process of learning
has been very, very helpful to my life.

00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:06.957
I feel like, as a potter,

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:11.067
you also start to learn
how to shape the world.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.178
There have been times
in my artistic capacity

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:17.041
that I wanted to reflect

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.704
on other really important moments

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:23.814
in the history of the U.S.,
the history of the world

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:25.405
where tough things happened,

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.086
but how do you talk about tough ideas

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:32.196
without separating people
from that content?

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:37.792
Could I use art like these old,
discontinued firehoses from Alabama,

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:43.946
to talk about the complexities of a moment
of civil rights in the '60s?

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:48.797
Is it possible to talk about my father
and I doing labor projects?

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:52.954
My dad was a roofer, construction guy,
he owned small businesses,

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:58.470
and at 80, he was ready to retire
and his tar kettle was my inheritance.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.659
Now, a tar kettle doesn't sound
like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.606
It was stinky and it took up
a lot of space in my studio,

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:11.901
but I asked my dad if he would be willing
to make some art with me,

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.732
if we could reimagine this kind
of nothing material

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:18.217
as something very special.

00:02:18.217 --> 00:02:21.607
And by elevating the material
and my dad's skill,

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:26.625
could we start to think about tar
just like clay, in a new way,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:32.017
shaping it differently,
helping us to imagine what was possible?

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:37.790
After clay, I was then kind of turned on
to lots of different kinds of materials,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.762
and my studio grew a lot
because I thought, well,

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:44.849
it's not really about the material,
it's about our capacity to shape things.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.705
I became more and more interested in ideas

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:52.537
and more and more things that 
were happening just outside my studio.

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:57.096
Just to give you a little bit of context,
I live in Chicago.

00:02:57.104 --> 00:03:00.359
I live on the South Side now.
I'm a West Sider.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.773
For those of you who are not Chicagoans,
that won't mean anything,

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:06.025
but if I didn't mention
that I was a West Sider,

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:10.204
there would be a lot of people
in the city that would be very upset.

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:13.153
The neighborhood that I live in
is Grand Crossing.

00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:16.195
It's a neighborhood
that has seen better days.

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:21.071
It is not a gated community by far.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.205
There is lots of abandonment
in my neighborhood,

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:27.711
and while I was kind of busy
making pots and busy making art

00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:29.662
and having a good art career,

00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:31.807
there was all of this stuff
that was happening

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:33.600
just outside my studio.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.748
All of us know about
failing housing markets

00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:39.580
and the challenges of blight,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.057
and I feel like we talk about it
with some of our cities more than others,

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.991
but I think a lot of our
U.S. cities and beyond

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.011
have the challenge of blight,

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.237
abandoned buildings that people
no longer know what to do anything with.

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:55.093
And so I thought, is there a way
that I could start to think

00:03:55.093 --> 00:04:00.479
about these buildings as an extension
or an expansion of my artistic practice?

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.498
And that if I was thinking
along with other creatives --

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:07.166
architects, engineers,
real estate finance people --

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:10.046
that us together might be able
to kind of think

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:13.715
in more complicated ways
about the reshaping of cities.

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:16.733
And so I bought a building.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:19.473
The building was really affordable.

00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:21.185
We tricked it out.

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.620
We made it as beautiful as we could
to try to just get some activity happening

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.872
on my block.

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:30.310
Once I bought the building
for about 18,000 dollars,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.330
I didn't have any money left.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.509
So I started sweeping the building
as a kind of performance.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.341
This is performance art,
and people would come over,

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:41.897
and I would start sweeping.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.544
Because the broom was free
and sweeping was free.

00:04:44.544 --> 00:04:46.703
It worked out.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.938
(Laughter)

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:54.389
But we would use the building, then,
to stage exhibitions, small dinners,

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.336
and we found that that building
on my block, Dorchester --

00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:01.052
we now referred to the block
as Dorchester projects --

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.535
that in a way that building
became a kind of gathering site

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:06.769
for lots of different kinds of activity.

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:11.222
We turned the building into
what we called now the Archive House.

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:14.403
The Archive House would do
all of these amazing things.

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:17.747
Very significant people
in the city and beyond

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:20.422
would find themselves
in the middle of the hood.

00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:22.790
And that's when I felt like

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.602
maybe there was a relationship
between my history with clay

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.172
and this new thing that was
starting to develop,

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:30.514
that we were slowly starting

00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:34.370
to reshape how people imagined
the South Side of the city.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.622
One house turned into a few houses,

00:05:37.622 --> 00:05:40.084
and we always tried to suggest

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:44.008
that not only is creating
a beautiful vessel important,

00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:47.884
but the contents of what happens
in those buildings is also very important.

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:50.532
So we were not only thinking
about development,

00:05:50.532 --> 00:05:52.854
but we were thinking about the program,

00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:56.360
thinking about the kind of connections
that could happen

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.809
between one house and another,
between one neighbor and another.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.181
This building became what we call
the Listening House,

00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.431
and it has a collection of discarded books

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.102
from the Johnson Publishing Corporation,

00:06:11.102 --> 00:06:15.095
and other books from an old bookstore
that was going out of business.

00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:19.368
I was actually just wanting to activate
these buildings as much as I could

00:06:19.368 --> 00:06:22.688
with whatever and whoever would join me.

00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:26.612
In Chicago, there's
amazing building stock.

00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:30.791
This building, which had been
the former crack house on the block,

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.345
and when the building became abandoned,

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:37.246
it became a great opportunity to really
imagine what else could happen there.

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:41.298
So this space we converted into
what we call Black Cinema House.

00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:45.419
Black Cinema House was an opportunity
in the hood to screen films

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.633
that were important and relevant
to the folk who lived around me,

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:53.348
that if we wanted to show
an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.

00:06:53.348 --> 00:06:56.018
If we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.

00:06:56.018 --> 00:06:57.991
That would be awesome.

00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:00.546
The building we soon outgrew,

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:03.053
and we had to move to a larger space.

00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:07.488
Black Cinema House, which was made
from just a small piece of clay,

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:14.779
had to grow into a much larger
piece of clay, which is now my studio.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.588
What I realized was that
for those of you who are zoning junkies,

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:20.582
that some of the things that I was doing

00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:23.881
in these buildings
that had been left behind,

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:27.713
they were not the uses by which
the buildings were built,

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.941
and that there are city policies that say,

00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:33.260
"Hey, a house that is residential
needs to stay residential."

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.067
But what do you do in neighborhoods when
ain't nobody interested in living there?

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:42.011
That the people who have
the means to leave have already left?

00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:44.498
What do we do with
these abandoned buildings?

00:07:44.498 --> 00:07:47.703
And so I was trying
to wake them up using culture.

00:07:47.703 --> 00:07:50.706
We found that that
was so exciting for folk,

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:55.271
and people were so responsive to the work,
that we had to then find bigger buildings.

00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:57.316
By the time we found bigger buildings,

00:07:57.316 --> 00:08:01.569
there was, in part, the resources 
necessary to think about those things.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:05.901
In this bank that we called the Arts Bank,
it was in pretty bad shape.

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.187
There was about six feet
of standing water.

00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:11.649
It was a difficult project to finance,

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:14.079
because banks weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.641
because people weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.742
because nothing had happened there.

00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:22.724
It was dirt. It was nothing.
It was nowhere.

00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:28.381
And so we just started imagining,
what else could happen in this building?

00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:33.846
(Applause)

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.615
And so now that the rumor
of my block has spread,

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.595
and lots of people are starting to visit,

00:08:38.595 --> 00:08:40.696
we've found that the bank
can now be a center

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:43.908
for exhibition, archives,
music performance,

00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:46.686
and that there are people
who are now interested

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:50.224
in being adjacent to those buildings
because we brought some heat,

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:52.677
that we kind of made a fire.

00:08:52.677 --> 00:08:56.926
One of the archives that we'll have there
is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.

00:08:56.926 --> 00:09:00.525
We've also started to collect
memorabilia from American history,

00:09:00.525 --> 00:09:04.356
from people who live
or have lived in that neighborhood.

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:08.094
Some of these images
are degraded images of black people,

00:09:08.094 --> 00:09:11.368
kind of histories
of very challenging content,

00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:13.829
and where better than a neighborhood

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:18.099
with young people who are constantly
asking themselves about their identity

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.354
to talk about some of the complexities

00:09:20.354 --> 00:09:22.196
of race and class?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.623
In some ways, the bank represents a hub,

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:31.975
that we're trying to create a pretty 
hardcore node of cultural activity,

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:34.842
and that if we could start
to make multiple hubs

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.791
and connect some cool
green stuff around there,

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.740
that the buildings that we've
purchased and rehabbed,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.014
which is now around 60 or 70 units,

00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:49.447
that if we could land
miniature Versailles on top of that,

00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:52.930
and connect these buildings
by a beautiful greenbelt --

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.855
(Applause) --

00:09:55.855 --> 00:09:59.315
that this place where people
never wanted to be

00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:01.776
would become an important destination

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:04.357
for folk from all over
the country and world.

00:10:05.027 --> 00:10:08.812
In some ways, it feels
very much like I'm a potter,

00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:12.225
that we tackle the things
that are at our wheel,

00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:14.488
we try with the skill that we have

00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:19.028
to think about this next bowl
that I want to make.

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:23.927
And it went from a bowl to a singular
house to a block to a neighborhood

00:10:23.927 --> 00:10:26.621
to a cultural district
to thinking about the city,

00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:30.707
and at every point, there were things
that I didn't know that I had to learn.

00:10:30.707 --> 00:10:33.749
I've never learned so much
about zoning law in my life.

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:35.529
I never thought I'd have to.

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:38.486
But as a result of that, I'm finding
that there's not just room

00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:40.227
for my own artistic practice,

00:10:40.227 --> 00:10:42.763
there's room for a lot of other
artistic practices.

00:10:43.803 --> 00:10:45.382
So people started asking us,

00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:47.853
"Well, Theaster, how are you
going to go to scale?"

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:49.988
and, "What's your sustainability plan?"

00:10:49.988 --> 00:10:54.739
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:58.616
And what I found was that
I couldn't export myself,

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.355
that what seems necessary
in cities like Akron, Ohio,

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:04.955
and Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,

00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:08.653
is that there are people in those places
who already believe in those places,

00:11:08.653 --> 00:11:11.579
that are already dying
to make those places beautiful,

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:15.038
and that often, those people
who are passionate about a place

00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:19.450
are disconnected from the resources
necessary to make cool things happen,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.027
or disconnected from
a contingency of people

00:11:22.027 --> 00:11:23.908
that could help make things happen.

00:11:23.908 --> 00:11:28.200
So now, we're starting to give advice
around the country

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.345
on how to start with what you got,

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:33.140
how to start with the things
that are in front of you,

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.517
how to make something out of nothing,

00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:40.045
how to reshape your world
at a wheel or at your block

00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:42.530
or at the scale of the city.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.225
Thank you so much.

00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:50.131
(Applause)

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:55.201
June Cohen: Thank you. So I think
many people watching this

00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:58.406
will be asking themselves
the question you just raised at the end:

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:00.588
How can they do this in their own city?

00:12:00.588 --> 00:12:02.209
You can't export yourself.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.882
Give us a few pages out of your playbook
about what someone who is inspired

00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:08.772
about their city can do
to take on projects like yours?

00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:11.965
Theaster Gates: One of the things
I've found that's really important

00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:16.052
is giving thought to not just
the kind of individual project,

00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.846
like an old house,

00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:21.717
but what's the relationship
between an old house,

00:12:21.717 --> 00:12:24.875
a local school, a small bodega,

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:27.871
and is there some kind of synergy
between those things?

00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.169
Can you get those folk talking?

00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:34.720
I've found that in cases
where neighborhoods have failed,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.903
they still often have a pulse.

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:40.362
How do you identify the pulse
in that place, the passionate people,

00:12:40.362 --> 00:12:43.367
and then how do you get folk
who have been fighting,

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:47.758
slogging for 20 years, reenergized
about the place that they live?

00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:50.219
And so someone has to do that work.

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:54.492
If I were a traditional developer,
I would be talking about buildings alone,

00:12:54.492 --> 00:12:58.439
and then putting
a "For Lease" sign in the window.

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:01.086
I think that you actually
have to curate more than that,

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:03.784
that there's a way in which
you have to be mindful about,

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.840
what are the businesses
that I want to grow here?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.282
And then, are there people
who live in this place

00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:11.302
who want to grow those businesses with me?

00:13:11.302 --> 00:13:14.135
Because I think it's not just
a cultural space or housing;

00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:17.177
there has to be the recreation
of an economic core.

00:13:17.177 --> 00:13:20.845
So thinking about those things
together feels right.

00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:23.651
JC: It's hard to get people
to create the spark again

00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:25.698
when people have been
slogging for 20 years.

00:13:25.698 --> 00:13:28.815
Are there any methods you've found
that have helped break through?

00:13:28.815 --> 00:13:31.782
TG: Yeah, I think that now
there are lots of examples

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:33.616
of folk who are doing amazing work,

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:38.051
but those methods are sometimes like,
when the media is constantly saying

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:41.023
that only violent things
happen in a place,

00:13:41.023 --> 00:13:44.320
then based on your skill set
and the particular context,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.640
what are the things that you can do
in your neighborhood

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.765
to kind of fight some of that?

00:13:49.765 --> 00:13:52.668
So I've found that
if you're a theater person,

00:13:52.668 --> 00:13:54.943
you have outdoor street theater festivals.

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:58.867
In some cases, we don't have
the resources in certain neighborhoods

00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:02.211
to do things that are
a certain kind of splashy,

00:14:02.211 --> 00:14:05.322
but if we can then find ways
of making sure that people

00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:06.854
who are local to a place,

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:10.686
plus people who could be supportive
of the things that are happening locally,

00:14:10.686 --> 00:14:12.450
when those people get together,

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.586
I think really amazing things can happen.

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:16.072
JC: So interesting.

00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:18.394
And how can you make sure
that the projects you're creating

00:14:18.394 --> 00:14:20.159
are actually for the disadvantaged

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:24.199
and not just for the sort of
vegetarian indie movie crowd

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:26.318
that might move in
to take advantage of them.

00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:31.359
TG: Right on. So I think this is where
it starts to get into the thick weeds.

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:33.996
JC: Let's go there.
TG: Right now, Grand Crossing

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:36.993
is 99 percent black, or at least living,

00:14:36.993 --> 00:14:40.313
and we know that maybe
who owns property in a place

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.774
is different from who walks
the streets every day.

00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:45.630
So it's reasonable to say
that Grand Crossing is already

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.485
in the process of being something
different than it is today.

00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:55.080
But are there ways to think about
housing trusts or land trusts

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.518
or a mission-based development

00:14:57.518 --> 00:15:00.281
that starts to protect
some of the space that happens,

00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:04.600
because when you have
7,500 empty lots in a city,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.551
you want something to happen there,

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:11.055
but you need entities that are not
just interested in the development piece,

00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:14.143
but entities that are interested
in the stabilization piece,

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:17.649
and I feel like often the developer piece
is really motivated,

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.016
but the other work of a kind
of neighborhood consciousness,

00:15:21.016 --> 00:15:22.990
that part doesn't live anymore.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.796
So how do you start to grow up
important watchdogs

00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:30.518
that ensure that the resources
that are made available

00:15:30.518 --> 00:15:31.954
to new folk that are coming in

00:15:31.954 --> 00:15:35.346
are also distributed to folk
who have lived in a place for a long time.

00:15:35.346 --> 00:15:37.955
JC: That makes so much sense.
One more question:

00:15:37.955 --> 00:15:42.002
You make such a compelling case for beauty
and the importance of beauty and the arts.

00:15:42.002 --> 00:15:45.280
There would be others who would argue
that funds would be better spent

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.484
on basic services for the disadvantaged.

00:15:48.484 --> 00:15:52.194
How do you combat that viewpoint,
or come against it?

00:15:52.194 --> 00:15:54.694
TG: I believe that beauty 
is a basic service.

00:15:54.694 --> 00:16:00.713
(Applause)

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:06.168
Often what I have found is that
when there are resources

00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:09.628
that have not been made available
to certain under-resourced cities

00:16:09.628 --> 00:16:11.694
or neighborhoods or communities,

00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:16.397
that sometimes culture is the thing
that helps to ignite,

00:16:16.397 --> 00:16:19.037
and that I can't do everything,

00:16:19.037 --> 00:16:22.444
but I think that there's a way in which
if you can start with culture

00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:25.416
and get people kind of
reinvested in their place,

00:16:25.416 --> 00:16:29.689
other kinds of adjacent
amenities start to grow,

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:33.642
and then people can make a demand
that's a poetic demand,

00:16:33.642 --> 00:16:38.883
and the political demands that
are necessary to wake up our cities,

00:16:38.883 --> 00:16:40.646
they also become very poetic.

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.558
JC: It makes perfect sense to me.

00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:45.225
Theaster, thank you so much
for being here with us today.

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:46.476
Thank you. Theaster Gates.

00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:51.491
(Applause)
