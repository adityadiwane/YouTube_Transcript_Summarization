00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.166
Some people think that there's
a TED Talk formula:

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.165
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.591
"Share a childhood story."

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.622
"Divulge a personal secret."

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:23.417
"End with an inspiring call to action."

00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:24.591
No.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.712
That's not how to think of a TED Talk.

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:28.725
In fact, if you overuse those devices,

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.892
you're just going to come across
as clichÃ©d or emotionally manipulative.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:36.796
But there is one thing that all
great TED Talks have in common,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.499
and I would like to share
that thing with you,

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:42.198
because over the past 12 years,
I've had a ringside seat,

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:46.961
listening to many hundreds
of amazing TED speakers, like these.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:49.422
I've helped them prepare
their talks for prime time,

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:50.882
and learned directly from them

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:53.232
their secrets of what
makes for a great talk.

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:56.026
And even though these speakers
and their topics all seem

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.201
completely different,

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.961
they actually do have
one key common ingredient.

00:01:01.318 --> 00:01:02.547
And it's this:

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:05.865
Your number one task as a speaker

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:10.476
is to transfer into your listeners' minds
an extraordinary gift --

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.079
a strange and beautiful object
that we call an idea.

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.369
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:18.544
Here's Haley.

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:20.534
She is about to give a TED Talk

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:22.401
and frankly, she's terrified.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:24.074
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.098
(Applause)

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:32.373
Over the course of 18 minutes,

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:36.361
1,200 people, many of whom
have never seen each other before,

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:40.505
are finding that their brains
are starting to sync with Haley's brain

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:41.967
and with each other.

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.385
They're literally beginning to exhibit
the same brain-wave patterns.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.275
And I don't just mean
they're feeling the same emotions.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.798
There's something even more
startling happening.

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:53.719
Let's take a look inside
Haley's brain for a moment.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.421
There are billions of interconnected
neurons in an impossible tangle.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.252
But look here, right here --

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:03.037
a few million of them
are linked to each other

00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.500
in a way which represents a single idea.

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:10.564
And incredibly, this exact pattern
is being recreated in real time

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.666
inside the minds of everyone listening.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.850
That's right; in just a few minutes,

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:18.237
a pattern involving millions of neurons

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.046
is being teleported into 1,200 minds,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.199
just by people listening to a voice
and watching a face.

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:27.491
But wait -- what is an idea anyway?

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:30.999
Well, you can think of it
as a pattern of information

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:34.411
that helps you understand
and navigate the world.

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:36.411
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:38.435
from the complex and analytical

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.538
to the simple and aesthetic.

00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:43.435
Here are just a few examples
shared from the TED stage.

00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:47.521
Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity
is key to our kids' future.

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:50.476
(Video) Sir Ken Robinson:
My contention is that creativity now

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.601
is as important in education as literacy,

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.115
and we should treat it
with the same status.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.259
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy --
building from bamboo is beautiful.

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.607
(Video) Elora Hardy:
It is growing all around us,

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.791
it's strong, it's elegant,
it's earthquake-resistant.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:09.656
CA: Chimamanda Adichie --
people are more than a single identity.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.782
(Video) Chimamanda Adichie:
The single story creates stereotypes,

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:17.203
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:19.211
but that they are incomplete.

00:03:19.607 --> 00:03:21.821
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:23.196
and not just randomly.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.426
They're carefully linked together.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.355
Collectively they form
an amazingly complex structure

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.553
that is your personal worldview.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.863
It's your brain's operating system.

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:34.759
It's how you navigate the world.

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:38.568
And it is built up out of millions
of individual ideas.

00:03:38.592 --> 00:03:42.061
So, for example, if one little
component of your worldview

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:44.911
is the idea that kittens are adorable,

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:47.330
then when you see this,

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.934
you'll react like this.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.035
But if another component of your worldview

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.322
is the idea that leopards are dangerous,

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.591
then when you see this,

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.876
you'll react a little bit differently.

00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:59.112
So, it's pretty obvious

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:03.049
why the ideas that make up
your worldview are crucial.

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:06.069
You need them to be as reliable
as possible -- a guide,

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:09.881
to the scary but wonderful
real world out there.

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.652
Now, different people's worldviews
can be dramatically different.

00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:15.384
For example,

00:04:15.408 --> 00:04:19.246
how does your worldview react
when you see this image:

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.887
(Video) Dalia Mogahed:
What do you think when you look at me?

00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:27.353
"A woman of faith,"
"an expert," maybe even "a sister"?

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:32.111
Or "oppressed," "brainwashed,"

00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:33.300
"a terrorist"?

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:35.349
CA: Whatever your answer,

00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:38.770
there are millions of people out there
who would react very differently.

00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:40.870
So that's why ideas really matter.

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:44.572
If communicated properly,
they're capable of changing, forever,

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:46.645
how someone thinks about the world,

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.054
and shaping their actions both now
and well into the future.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:55.484
Ideas are the most powerful force
shaping human culture.

00:04:55.508 --> 00:04:56.659
So if you accept

00:04:56.683 --> 00:04:59.413
that your number one task
as a speaker is to build an idea

00:04:59.437 --> 00:05:01.483
inside the minds of your audience,

00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:04.801
here are four guidelines
for how you should go about that task:

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:08.646
One, limit your talk
to just one major idea.

00:05:09.157 --> 00:05:10.990
Ideas are complex things;

00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:14.379
you need to slash back your content
so that you can focus

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:17.156
on the single idea
you're most passionate about,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.814
and give yourself a chance
to explain that one thing properly.

00:05:20.838 --> 00:05:24.591
You have to give context,
share examples, make it vivid.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:25.862
So pick one idea,

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:29.087
and make it the through-line
running through your entire talk,

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:32.589
so that everything you say
links back to it in some way.

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:36.557
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:41.554
Before you can start building things
inside the minds of your audience,

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.983
you have to get their permission
to welcome you in.

00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:45.840
And the main tool to achieve that?

00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:47.524
Curiosity.

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.796
Stir your audience's curiosity.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.041
Use intriguing, provocative questions

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:56.246
to identify why something
doesn't make sense and needs explaining.

00:05:56.698 --> 00:06:00.659
If you can reveal a disconnection
in someone's worldview,

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:04.000
they'll feel the need
to bridge that knowledge gap.

00:06:04.024 --> 00:06:06.063
And once you've sparked that desire,

00:06:06.087 --> 00:06:09.371
it will be so much easier
to start building your idea.

00:06:10.032 --> 00:06:13.405
Three, build your idea, piece by piece,

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.143
out of concepts that your audience
already understands.

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:18.814
You use the power of language

00:06:18.838 --> 00:06:21.767
to weave together
concepts that already exist

00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:23.428
in your listeners' minds --

00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:25.746
but not your language, their language.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.206
You start where they are.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.928
The speakers often forget that many
of the terms and concepts they live with

00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:33.563
are completely unfamiliar
to their audiences.

00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:38.761
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role
in showing how the pieces fit together,

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:42.459
because they reveal
the desired shape of the pattern,

00:06:42.483 --> 00:06:45.991
based on an idea that the listener
already understands.

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.000
For example, when Jennifer Kahn

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:51.673
wanted to explain the incredible
new biotechnology called CRISPR,

00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:53.983
she said, "It's as if, for the first time,

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:57.038
you had a word processor to edit DNA.

00:06:57.062 --> 00:07:01.689
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste
genetic information really easily."

00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:06.443
Now, a vivid explanation like that
delivers a satisfying aha moment

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:08.800
as it snaps into place in our minds.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:12.744
It's important, therefore,
to test your talk on trusted friends,

00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:15.372
and find out which parts
they get confused by.

00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:17.704
Four, here's the final tip:

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.505
Make your idea worth sharing.

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.895
By that I mean, ask yourself the question:

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.737
"Who does this idea benefit?"

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:29.450
And I need you to be honest
with the answer.

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:32.386
If the idea only serves you
or your organization,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.687
then, I'm sorry to say,
it's probably not worth sharing.

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:37.822
The audience will see right through you.

00:07:37.846 --> 00:07:40.528
But if you believe that the idea
has the potential

00:07:40.552 --> 00:07:42.450
to brighten up someone else's day

00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:45.290
or change someone else's
perspective for the better

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:48.178
or inspire someone to do
something differently,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:51.822
then you have the core ingredient
to a truly great talk,

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:54.976
one that can be a gift to them
and to all of us.
