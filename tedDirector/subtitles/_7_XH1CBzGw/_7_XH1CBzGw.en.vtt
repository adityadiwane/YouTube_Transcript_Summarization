00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.340
What is so special about the human brain?

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.552
Why is it that we study other animals

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.673
instead of them studying us?

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.471
What does a human brain have or do

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.204
that no other brain does?

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:26.052
When I became interested
in these questions about 10 years ago,

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:28.994
scientists thought they knew
what different brains were made of.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.723
Though it was based on very little evidence,

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:32.910
many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.635
including the human brain,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:35.935
were made in the same way,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.437
with a number of neurons that was always

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.668
proportional to the size of the brain.

00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:41.744
This means that two brains of the same size,

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:45.292
like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:47.844
should have similar numbers of neurons.

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:49.640
Now, if neurons are the functional

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.543
information processing units of the brain,

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:54.135
then the owners of these two brains

00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:56.864
should have similar cognitive abilities.

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:59.213
And yet, one is a chimp,

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:01.850
and the other is a cow.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.212
Now maybe cows have a really rich

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:06.465
internal mental life and are so smart

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:10.268
that they choose not to let us realize it,

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:11.713
but we eat them.

00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:13.412
I think most people will agree

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:15.413
that chimps are capable of much more complex,

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:18.469
elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.401
So this is a first indication that the

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.434
"all brains are made the same way" scenario

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:24.105
is not quite right.

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:25.451
But let's play along.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.229
If all brains were made the same way

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.141
and you were to compare animals
with brains of different sizes,

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:32.323
larger brains should always have more neurons

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:34.646
than smaller brains,
and the larger the brain,

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:37.668
the more cognitively able its owner should be.

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:39.804
So the largest brain around should also be

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:42.093
the most cognitively able.

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:43.674
And here comes the bad news:

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:46.431
Our brain, not the largest one around.

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:47.986
It seems quite vexing.

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:50.721
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.038
but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,

00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:56.623
and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,

00:01:56.623 --> 00:02:01.361
which is why scientists used to resort to saying

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.518
that our brain must be special

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:06.380
to explain our cognitive abilities.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.326
It must be really extraordinary,

00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:11.303
an exception to the rule.

00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:14.529
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.404
and it could be better, for example,

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:18.515
in that it seems larger than it should be,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.213
with a much larger cerebral cortex
than we should have

00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:22.752
for the size of our bodies.

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:24.404
So that would give us extra cortex

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:27.364
to do more interesting things
than just operating the body.

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.043
That's because the size of the brain

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:31.376
usually follows the size of the body.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.693
So the main reason for saying that

00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:35.780
our brain is larger than it should be

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.552
actually comes from comparing ourselves

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:39.238
to great apes.

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:41.832
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,

00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:44.253
so their brains should also be larger than ours,

00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:46.198
but instead it's the other way around.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:49.133
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.253
The human brain also seems special

00:02:51.253 --> 00:02:53.500
in the amount of energy that it uses.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.249
Although it weighs only two percent of the body,

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.692
it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.155
that your body requires to run per day.

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:05.508
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:07.913
just to keep your brain working.

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.841
So the human brain is larger than it should be,

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.867
it uses much more energy than it should,

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:14.325
so it's special.

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.896
And this is where the story started to bother me.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.567
In biology, we look for rules

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:21.413
that apply to all animals and to life in general,

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:23.263
so why should the rules of evolution

00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:26.905
apply to everybody else but not to us?

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:29.102
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption

00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:30.973
that all brains are made in the same way.

00:03:30.973 --> 00:03:32.572
Maybe two brains of a similar size

00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:35.163
can actually be made of
very different numbers of neurons.

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:36.770
Maybe a very large brain

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.610
does not necessarily have more neurons

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.831
than a more modest-sized brain.

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.840
Maybe the human brain 
actually has the most neurons

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.413
of any brain, regardless of its size,

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:48.507
especially in the cerebral cortex.

00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:50.059
So this to me became

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.788
the important question to answer:

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:54.188
how many neurons does the human brain have,

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:56.710
and how does that compare to other animals?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.133
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:01.244
that we have 100 billion neurons,

00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:03.330
so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.169
if they knew where this number came from.

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.627
But nobody did.

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:08.080
I've been digging through the literature

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.138
for the original reference for that number,

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:11.921
and I could never find it.

00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.660
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.194
the number of neurons in the human brain,

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:18.693
or in any other brain for that matter.

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:22.228
So I came up with my own way
to count cells in the brain,

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.336
and it essentially consists of

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:27.581
dissolving that brain into soup.

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.618
It works like this:

00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:32.745
You take a brain, or parts of that brain,

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:34.489
and you dissolve it in detergent,

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.998
which destroys the cell membranes

00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:38.434
but keeps the cell nuclei intact,

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:41.574
so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei

00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:43.355
that looks like this,

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:44.628
like a clear soup.

00:04:44.628 --> 00:04:46.519
This soup contains all the nuclei

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.573
that once were a mouse brain.

00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:51.603
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.501
you can agitate it and make those nuclei

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:56.472
be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,

00:04:56.472 --> 00:04:58.453
so that now by looking under the microscope

00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:02.536
at just four or five samples
of this homogeneous solution,

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:05.072
you can count nuclei, and therefore tell

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.751
how many cells that brain had.

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:08.376
It's simple, it's straightforward,

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.810
and it's really fast.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.807
So we've used that method to count neurons

00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:14.118
in dozens of different species so far,

00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:15.807
and it turns out that all brains

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:18.389
are not made the same way.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.576
Take rodents and primates, for instance:

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.860
In larger rodent brains, the average size

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.546
of the neuron increases,

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:27.145
so the brain inflates very rapidly

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:30.310
and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.013
But primate brains gain neurons

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:34.472
without the average neuron becoming any larger,

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:35.997
which is a very economical way

00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:37.650
to add neurons to your brain.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.414
The result is that a primate brain

00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:42.581
will always have more neurons than
a rodent brain of the same size,

00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:44.064
and the larger the brain,

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.278
the larger this difference will be.

00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.381
Well, what about our brain then?

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.065
We found that we have, on average,

00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:51.850
86 billion neurons,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.849
16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.930
and if you consider that the cerebral cortex

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.024
is the seat of functions like

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:03.161
awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:06.145
and that 16 billion is the most neurons

00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:08.766
that any cortex has,

00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:10.484
I think this is the simplest explanation

00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:13.626
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:16.847
But just as important is what
the 86 billion neurons mean.

00:06:16.847 --> 00:06:18.376
Because we found that the relationship

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:20.728
between the size of the brain
and its number of neurons

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.355
could be described mathematically,

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.573
we could calculate what a human brain

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:27.247
would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:30.821
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons

00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:33.942
would weigh 36 kilos.

00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:35.575
That's not possible.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:37.481
A brain that huge would be crushed

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.665
by its own weight,

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:40.252
and this impossible brain would go

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:44.023
in the body of 89 tons.

00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:46.157
I don't think it looks like us.

00:06:46.157 --> 00:06:48.710
So this brings us to a very important
conclusion already,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.357
which is that we are not rodents.

00:06:51.357 --> 00:06:54.625
The human brain is not a large rat brain.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:57.253
Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,

00:06:57.253 --> 00:06:59.473
but that's not a fair comparison to make,

00:06:59.473 --> 00:07:01.562
given that we know that we are not rodents.

00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:02.952
We are primates,

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:05.726
so the correct comparison is to other primates.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:06.953
And there, if you do the math,

00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:09.739
you find that a generic primate

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:11.669
with 86 billion neurons

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.672
would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,

00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:16.561
which seems just right,

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.533
in a body of some 66 kilos,

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:21.178
which in my case is exactly right,

00:07:21.178 --> 00:07:23.798
which brings us to a very unsurprising

00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:26.767
but still incredibly important conclusion:

00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:28.108
I am a primate.

00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:30.806
And all of you are primates.

00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:32.706
And so was Darwin.

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:35.646
I love to think that Darwin
would have really appreciated this.

00:07:35.646 --> 00:07:37.613
His brain, like ours,

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:41.124
was made in the image of other primate brains.

00:07:41.124 --> 00:07:43.426
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:46.207
but it is not special in its number of neurons.

00:07:46.207 --> 00:07:48.062
It is just a large primate brain.

00:07:48.062 --> 00:07:51.106
I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought

00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:54.169
that should remind us of our place in nature.

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.813
Why does it cost so much energy, then?

00:07:56.813 --> 00:07:58.260
Well, other people have figured out

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.763
how much energy the human brain

00:07:59.763 --> 00:08:01.170
and that of other species costs,

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.822
and now that we knew how many neurons

00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:05.164
each brain was made of, we could do the math.

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:07.030
And it turns out that both human

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.853
and other brains cost about the same,

00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:13.274
an average of six calories 
per billion neurons per day.

00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:15.413
So the total energetic cost of a brain

00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:17.447
is a simple, linear function

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:19.156
of its number of neurons,

00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:21.339
and it turns out that the human brain

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:25.180
costs just as much energy as you would expect.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.271
So the reason why the human brain

00:08:27.271 --> 00:08:28.943
costs so much energy is simply because

00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:30.926
it has a huge number of neurons,

00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:32.411
and because we are primates

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.910
with many more neurons for a given body size

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.432
than any other animal,

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.972
the relative cost of our brain is large,

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:42.973
but just because we're primates,
not because we're special.

00:08:42.973 --> 00:08:44.163
Last question, then:

00:08:44.163 --> 00:08:47.278
how did we come by this
remarkable number of neurons,

00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.178
and in particular, if great apes

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:50.733
are larger than we are,

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:54.498
why don't they have a larger brain 
than we do, with more neurons?

00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:56.588
When we realized how much expensive it is

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.921
to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.924
maybe there's a simple reason.

00:09:00.924 --> 00:09:02.607
They just can't afford the energy

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:05.557
for both a large body 
and a large number of neurons.

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:06.986
So we did the math.

00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:08.586
We calculated on the one hand

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:10.527
how much energy a primate gets per day

00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:11.877
from eating raw foods,

00:09:11.877 --> 00:09:13.914
and on the other hand, how much energy

00:09:13.914 --> 00:09:15.678
a body of a certain size costs

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:19.065
and how much energy a brain of a
certain number of neurons costs,

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:20.554
and we looked for the combinations

00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:22.965
of body size and number of brain neurons

00:09:22.965 --> 00:09:24.235
that a primate could afford

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.783
if it ate a certain number of hours per day.

00:09:26.783 --> 00:09:28.599
And what we found is that

00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:30.311
because neurons are so expensive,

00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:33.681
there is a tradeoff between
body size and number of neurons.

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.632
So a primate that eats eight hours per day

00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:39.656
can afford at most 53 billion neurons,

00:09:39.656 --> 00:09:41.383
but then its body cannot be any bigger

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:43.337
than 25 kilos.

00:09:43.337 --> 00:09:45.038
To weigh any more than that,

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:46.807
it has to give up neurons.

00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:49.460
So it's either a large body

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.955
or a large number of neurons.

00:09:50.955 --> 00:09:52.320
When you eat like a primate,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.556
you can't afford both.

00:09:54.556 --> 00:09:56.520
One way out of this metabolic limitation

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.921
would be to spend even more hours per day eating,

00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.284
but that gets dangerous,

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:04.003
and past a certain point, it's just not possible.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.540
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.463
afford about 30 billion neurons

00:10:07.463 --> 00:10:10.429
by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:13.545
and that seems to be about as much as they can do.

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:15.336
Nine hours of feeding per day

00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:18.607
seems to be the practical limit for a primate.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:20.398
What about us?

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:21.998
With our 86 billion neurons

00:10:21.998 --> 00:10:25.033
and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,

00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:28.594
we should have to spend over nine hours

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:32.169
per day every single day feeding,

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.208
which is just not feasible.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:36.042
If we ate like a primate,

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:38.295
we should not be here.

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:40.422
How did we get here, then?

00:10:40.422 --> 00:10:43.157
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy

00:10:43.157 --> 00:10:44.880
as it should, and if we can't spend

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.554
every waking hour of the day feeding,

00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:50.465
then the only alternative, really,

00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:52.423
is to somehow get more energy

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:54.376
out of the same foods.

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:58.176
And remarkably, that matches exactly

00:10:58.176 --> 00:11:01.213
what our ancestors are believed to have invented

00:11:01.213 --> 00:11:03.052
one and a half million years ago,

00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:05.834
when they invented cooking.

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:07.804
To cook is to use fire

00:11:07.804 --> 00:11:11.604
to pre-digest foods outside of your body.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.210
Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.773
and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,

00:11:16.773 --> 00:11:18.925
so that allows them to be completely digested

00:11:18.925 --> 00:11:20.361
and absorbed in your gut,

00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:24.016
which makes them yield much more
energy in much less time.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.505
So cooking frees time for us to do

00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:28.567
much more interesting things with our day

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:30.047
and with our neurons

00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:31.952
than just thinking about food,

00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:33.656
looking for food, and gobbling down food

00:11:33.656 --> 00:11:34.881
all day long.

00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.380
So because of cooking, what once was

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.733
a major liability, this large,

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:42.766
dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,

00:11:42.766 --> 00:11:44.802
could now become a major asset,

00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:48.053
now that we could both afford 
the energy for a lot of neurons

00:11:48.056 --> 00:11:50.559
and the time to do interesting things with them.

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:52.533
So I think this explains why the human brain

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:55.773
grew to become so large so fast in evolution,

00:11:55.773 --> 00:11:59.670
all of the while remaining just a primate brain.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.444
With this large brain now affordable by cooking,

00:12:02.444 --> 00:12:05.357
we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.963
agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,

00:12:07.963 --> 00:12:09.588
electricity, refrigerators,

00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:11.195
all of those things that nowadays

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:13.237
allow us to get all the energy we need

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:16.019
for the whole day in a single sitting

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.973
at your favorite fast food joint.

00:12:18.973 --> 00:12:21.410
So what once was a solution

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.109
now became the problem,

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:28.626
and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.

00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:31.182
So what is the human advantage?

00:12:31.182 --> 00:12:32.685
What is it that we have

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:35.220
that no other animal has?

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.568
My answer is that we have the largest number

00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:39.040
of neurons in the cerebral cortex,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.884
and I think that's the simplest explanation

00:12:40.884 --> 00:12:42.897
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:46.124
And what is it that we do that no other animal does,

00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:48.093
and which I believe was fundamental

00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:51.176
to allow us to reach that large,

00:12:51.176 --> 00:12:53.398
largest number of neurons in the cortex?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.613
In two words, we cook.

00:12:55.613 --> 00:12:59.179
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:02.049
And I think that's how we got to become human.

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.509
Studying the human brain changed 
the way I think about food.

00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:06.154
I now look at my kitchen,

00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:07.624
and I bow to it,

00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:09.329
and I thank my ancestors for coming up

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:11.229
with the invention that probably made us humans.

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:13.361
Thank you very much.

00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:19.714
(Applause)
