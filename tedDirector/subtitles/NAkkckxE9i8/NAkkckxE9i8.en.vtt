00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.388
As a singer-songwriter,

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:19.127
people often ask me about my influences
or, as I like to call them,

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.539
my sonic lineages.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.191
And I could easily tell you

00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:26.635
that I was shaped by the jazz
and hip hop that I grew up with,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.970
by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:32.897
or by the 1980s pop
on my childhood radio stations.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.374
But beyond genre,
there is another question:

00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:42.240
how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make?

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:44.600
I believe that everyday soundscape

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:48.065
can be the most unexpected
inspiration for songwriting,

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.604
and to look at this idea
a little bit more closely,

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:52.749
I'm going to talk today
about three things:

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:55.797
nature, language and silence --

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:59.154
or rather, the impossibility
of true silence.

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:02.357
And through this I hope to give you
a sense of a world

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.432
already alive with musical expression,

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:09.437
with each of us serving
as active participants,

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:11.716
whether we know it or not.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:14.954
I'm going to start today with nature,
but before we do that,

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:18.250
let's quickly listen to this snippet
of an opera singer warming up.

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:19.758
Here it is.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
(Singing)

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.060
(Singing ends)

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:39.408
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.352
Gotcha!

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:44.812
That is actually not the sound
of an opera singer warming up.

00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:47.660
That is the sound of a bird

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:49.606
slowed down to a pace

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.352
that the human ear mistakenly
recognizes as its own.

00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:58.816
It was released as part of Peter Szöke's
1987 Hungarian recording

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.222
"The Unknown Music of Birds,"

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.117
where he records many birds
and slows down their pitches

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:06.748
to reveal what's underneath.

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.644
Let's listen to the full-speed recording.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.110
(Bird singing)

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:17.550
Now, let's hear the two of them together

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:19.146
so your brain can juxtapose them.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:25.167
(Bird singing at slow then full speed)

00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:40.338
(Singing ends)

00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:43.254
It's incredible.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:48.126
Perhaps the techniques of opera singing
were inspired by birdsong.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.768
As humans, we intuitively understand birds
to be our musical teachers.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.343
In Ethiopia, birds
are considered an integral part

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.973
of the origin of music itself.

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:02.017
The story goes like this:

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:08.571
1,500 years ago, a young man
was born in the Empire of Aksum,

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.142
a major trading center
of the ancient world.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.066
His name was Yared.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.610
When Yared was seven years old
his father died,

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:21.257
and his mother sent him to go live
with an uncle, who was a priest

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.576
of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.734
one of the oldest churches in the world.

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:30.353
Now, this tradition has an enormous amount
of scholarship and learning,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.389
and Yared had to study and study
and study and study,

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.029
and one day he was studying under a tree,

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:38.580
when three birds came to him.

00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:42.389
One by one, these birds
became his teachers.

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:46.204
They taught him music -- scales, in fact.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.082
And Yared, eventually
recognized as Saint Yared,

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:54.544
used these scales to compose
five volumes of chants and hymns

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.740
for worship and celebration.

00:03:56.764 --> 00:04:00.153
And he used these scales
to compose and to create

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.927
an indigenous musical notation system.

00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:07.268
And these scales evolved
into what is known as kiñit,

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:13.185
the unique, pentatonic, five-note,
modal system that is very much alive

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.433
and thriving and still evolving
in Ethiopia today.

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:21.694
Now, I love this story because
it's true at multiple levels.

00:04:21.718 --> 00:04:24.741
Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.714
and the natural world
can be our musical teacher.

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:31.211
And we have so many examples of this:

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.458
the Pygmies of the Congo
tune their instruments

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:36.082
to the pitches of the birds
in the forest around them.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:39.574
Musician and natural soundscape
expert Bernie Krause describes

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:42.972
how a healthy environment
has animals and insects

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:46.424
taking up low, medium
and high-frequency bands,

00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:49.642
in exactly the same way
as a symphony does.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:54.429
And countless works of music
were inspired by bird and forest song.

00:04:54.972 --> 00:04:59.845
Yes, the natural world
can be our cultural teacher.

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.124
So let's go now to the uniquely
human world of language.

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:08.327
Every language communicates
with pitch to varying degrees,

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.789
whether it's Mandarin Chinese,

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:13.805
where a shift in melodic inflection
gives the same phonetic syllable

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:15.586
an entirely different meaning,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.952
to a language like English,

00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:19.346
where a raised pitch
at the end of a sentence ...

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.388
(Going up in pitch) implies a question?

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.021
(Laughter)

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:24.704
As an Ethiopian-American woman,

00:05:24.728 --> 00:05:27.136
I grew up around the language
of Amharic, Amhariña.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.639
It was my first language,
the language of my parents,

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.220
one of the main languages of Ethiopia.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.910
And there are a million reasons
to fall in love with this language:

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:38.775
its depth of poetics,
its double entendres,

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:41.416
its wax and gold, its humor,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.330
its proverbs that illuminate
the wisdom and follies of life.

00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:50.117
But there's also this melodicism,
a musicality built right in.

00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:52.609
And I find this distilled most clearly

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:55.106
in what I like to call
emphatic language --

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.366
language that's meant
to highlight or underline

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.445
or that springs from surprise.

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:02.443
Take, for example, the word: "indey."

00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:05.306
Now, if there are Ethiopians
in the audience,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.337
they're probably chuckling to themselves,

00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:09.445
because the word means
something like "No!"

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.280
or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.405
It kind of depends on the situation.

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.280
But when I was a kid,
this was my very favorite word,

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:20.404
and I think it's because it has a pitch.

00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:21.932
It has a melody.

00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:24.957
You can almost see the shape
as it springs from someone's mouth.

00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.710
"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.

00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.480
And as a musician and composer,
when I hear that word,

00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:34.573
something like this
is floating through my mind.

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:40.982
(Music and singing "Indey")

00:06:45.832 --> 00:06:47.832
(Music ends)

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.702
Or take, for example, the phrase
for "It is right" or "It is correct" --

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:54.298
"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."

00:06:54.322 --> 00:06:56.955
It's an affirmation, an agreement.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:58.137
"Lickih nehu."

00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.313
When I hear that phrase,

00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:02.834
something like this starts rolling
through my mind.

00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:09.031
(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:13.572
(Music ends)

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.016
And in both of those cases,
what I did was I took the melody

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.499
and the phrasing
of those words and phrases

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:24.089
and I turned them into musical parts
to use in these short compositions.

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.020
And I like to write bass lines,

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:28.095
so they both ended up
kind of as bass lines.

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:32.013
Now, this is based on the work
of Jason Moran and others

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:35.075
who work intimately
with music and language,

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:38.043
but it's also something I've had
in my head since I was a kid,

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:40.098
how musical my parents sounded

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:43.274
when they were speaking
to each other and to us.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.444
It was from them
and from Amhariña that I learned

00:07:46.468 --> 00:07:49.348
that we are awash in musical expression

00:07:49.372 --> 00:07:51.987
with every word,
every sentence that we speak,

00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.763
every word, every sentence
that we receive.

00:07:54.787 --> 00:07:59.046
Perhaps you can hear it
in the words I'm speaking even now.

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:02.652
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States

00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:06.587
and the most seminal work
of 20th century avant-garde composition:

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.735
John Cage's "4:33,"

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.993
written for any instrument
or combination of instruments.

00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:16.471
The musician or musicians are invited
to walk onto the stage

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:19.685
with a stopwatch and open the score,

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:22.640
which was actually purchased
by the Museum of Modern Art --

00:08:22.664 --> 00:08:24.046
the score, that is.

00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:28.149
And this score has not
a single note written

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:30.647
and there is not a single note played

00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:33.403
for four minutes and 33 seconds.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.230
And, at once enraging and enrapturing,

00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:42.142
Cage shows us that even
when there are no strings

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:47.214
being plucked by fingers
or hands hammering piano keys,

00:08:47.238 --> 00:08:49.715
still there is music,
still there is music,

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.801
still there is music.

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:53.953
And what is this music?

00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:57.108
It was that sneeze in the back.

00:08:57.132 --> 00:08:58.678
(Laughter)

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:03.762
It is the everyday soundscape
that arises from the audience themselves:

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:08.056
their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,
their whispers, their sneezes,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.621
the room, the wood
of the floors and the walls

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:13.103
expanding and contracting,
creaking and groaning

00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:14.531
with the heat and the cold,

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.646
the pipes clanking and contributing.

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:22.946
And controversial though it was,
and even controversial though it remains,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.214
Cage's point is that there is no
such thing as true silence.

00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:32.612
Even in the most silent environments,
we still hear and feel the sound

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:34.163
of our own heartbeats.

00:09:34.646 --> 00:09:37.814
The world is alive
with musical expression.

00:09:38.383 --> 00:09:40.590
We are already immersed.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.023
Now, I had my own moment of,
let's say, remixing John Cage

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:47.714
a couple of months ago

00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:50.741
when I was standing
in front of the stove cooking lentils.

00:09:50.765 --> 00:09:53.907
And it was late one night
and it was time to stir,

00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:55.903
so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:58.360
and I placed it onto
the kitchen counter next to me,

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:00.647
and it started to roll back and forth

00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:03.432
making this sound.

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:09.765
(Sound of metal lid
clanking against a counter)

00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:12.079
(Clanking ends)

00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:15.059
And it stopped me cold.

00:10:15.727 --> 00:10:20.950
I thought, "What a weird, cool swing
that cooking pan lid has."

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.784
So when the lentils were ready and eaten,

00:10:26.808 --> 00:10:30.302
I hightailed it to my backyard studio,

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.169
and I made this.

00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:38.187
(Music, including the sound
of the lid, and singing)

00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:51.421
(Music ends)

00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:54.891
Now, John Cage
wasn't instructing musicians

00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:58.610
to mine the soundscape
for sonic textures to turn into music.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.913
He was saying that on its own,

00:11:01.937 --> 00:11:05.398
the environment is musically generative,

00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:09.663
that it is generous, that it is fertile,

00:11:09.687 --> 00:11:11.850
that we are already immersed.

00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:18.778
Musician, music researcher, surgeon
and human hearing expert Charles Limb

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.857
is a professor at Johns Hopkins University

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:23.150
and he studies music and the brain.

00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:26.505
And he has a theory

00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:30.831
that it is possible -- it is possible --

00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:36.003
that the human auditory system
actually evolved to hear music,

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:41.098
because it is so much more complex
than it needs to be for language alone.

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.508
And if that's true,

00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:46.477
it means that we're hard-wired for music,

00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:48.614
that we can find it anywhere,

00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:51.716
that there is no such thing
as a musical desert,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.439
that we are permanently
hanging out at the oasis,

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:57.520
and that is marvelous.

00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:01.328
We can add to the soundtrack,
but it's already playing.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.114
And it doesn't mean don't study music.

00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:08.634
Study music, trace your sonic lineages
and enjoy that exploration.

00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:13.090
But there is a kind of sonic lineage
to which we all belong.

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.890
So the next time you are seeking
percussion inspiration,

00:12:16.914 --> 00:12:20.263
look no further than your tires,
as they roll over the unusual grooves

00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:22.011
of the freeway,

00:12:22.035 --> 00:12:24.213
or the top-right burner of your stove

00:12:24.237 --> 00:12:25.946
and that strange way that it clicks

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.032
as it is preparing to light.

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:30.345
When seeking melodic inspiration,

00:12:30.369 --> 00:12:33.861
look no further than dawn
and dusk avian orchestras

00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:37.113
or to the natural lilt
of emphatic language.

00:12:37.137 --> 00:12:40.136
We are the audience
and we are the composers

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.955
and we take from these pieces

00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:43.130
we are given.

00:12:43.154 --> 00:12:45.022
We make, we make, we make, we make,

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:49.466
knowing that when it comes to nature
or language or soundscape,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.487
there is no end to the inspiration --

00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:54.945
if we are listening.

00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.573
Thank you.

00:12:56.597 --> 00:13:02.371
