00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
especially at the end of these balloon flights

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
around the world I did with Brian Jones.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
When I took this picture,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And on the other side there was a rising sun.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.260
So, you see that on the other side of ice

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
you have the unknown,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
you have the non-obvious,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
you have the non-seen,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
for the people who don't dare

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to go through the ice.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
There are so many people

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
who prefer to suffer in the ice they know

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
instead of taking the risk of going through the ice

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
to see what there is on the other side.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And I think that's one of the main problems of our society.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
but so many other people learn,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that the unknown, the doubts,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
the question marks are dangerous.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And we have to resist to the changes.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
We have to keep everything under control.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Well, the unknown is part of life.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Because in the balloon, like in life,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
we go very well in unforeseen directions.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
We want to go in a direction,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And as long as we fight horizontally,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
against life, against the winds,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
against what's happening to us,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
life is a nightmare.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
How do we steer a balloon?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
By understanding that the atmosphere

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
is made out of several different layers of wind

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
which all have different direction.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
in life, or in the balloon,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
we have to change altitude.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Changing altitude, in life,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that means raising to another psychological, philosophical,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
spiritual level.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But how do we do that?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
In ballooning, or in life,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
how do we change altitude?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
How do we go from the metaphor

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to something more practical that we can really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
use every day?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And I think in life it should be exactly like this.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
very often they believe that pioneers

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
are the ones who have new ideas.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
It's not true.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
because new ideas are so easy to have.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
with a lot of new ideas.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
No, the pioneer is the one who

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Habits, certainties,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.260
convictions, exclamation marks,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
paradigms, dogmas.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And when we are able to do that,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
what happens?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Life is not anymore

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
just one line going in one direction

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
in one dimension. No.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that go in all the possible directions

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in three dimensions.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to explore this vertical axis.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
but in life itself.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Explore this vertical axis, that means

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
explore all the different ways to do,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.260
before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
This is very practical.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
This can be in politics.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
This can be in spirituality.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
This can be in environment,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
in finance, in education of children.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I deeply believe

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
that life is a much greater adventure

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
if we manage to do politics

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
without the trench between the left and the right wing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Because we will throw away these political dogmas.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
if we get rid -- if we throw overboard

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.260
this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And that we can aim for much higher spirituality

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
if we get rid of the religious dogmas.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Well, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
to be invited to talk about it.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
(Laughter)

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Applause)

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and which altitude to take. Sometime we need

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
friends, family members or a psychiatrist.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Well, in balloons we need weather men,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.260
the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
But sometimes it's very paradoxical.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
the weather man asked us, one day, to fly

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
quite low, and very slow.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
around the world at that speed.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I was so proud to have found that jetstream

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
that I called the weather man,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
and I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
We fly twice the speed you predicted."

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
in order to slow down."

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
We don't have enough gas to fly so slow."

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
you will turn left and end up at the North Pole.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Laughter)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And then he asked me --

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
and this is something I will never forget in my life --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
What do you really want? You want to go very fast

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
(Laughter)

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
(Applause)

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And this is why you need weathermen.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
This is why you need people with long-term vision.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And this is precisely what fails

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
in the political visions we have now,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
in the political governments.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
We are burning, as you heard,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
so much energy,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.260
not understanding that such an unsustainable

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
way of life cannot last for long.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So, we went down actually.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
because we had no idea how the little amount of gas

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
we had in the balloon

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And actually this is where the adventure really started.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
When we were flying over the Sahara and India

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
it was nice holidays.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
In the middle of the Pacific,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
you cannot go back.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
That's a crisis.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
That's the moment when you have to wake up

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
from the automatic way of thinking.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
That's the moment when you have to motivate

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
your inner potential,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
your creativity.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
That's when you throw out all the ballast,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
all the certainties,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
in order to adapt to the new situation.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And actually, we changed completely our flight plan.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
We changed completely our strategy.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
But if I show you this picture

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
it's not to tell you how happy we were.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
It's to show you how much gas was left

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
in the last bottles.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.260
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
We landed with 40 kilos.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
When I saw that, I made a promise to myself.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
it would be with no fuel,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
independent from fossil energies,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in order to be safe,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
not to be threatened by the fuel gauge.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I had no idea how it was possible.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
with Chuck Yeager's 61,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
I had really a thought then.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
It allowed to do all those things there.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
But it will not be possible in the future any more.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
It will be prohibited

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
because we'll have to save our natural resources

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
in a few decades from now.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So how can we perpetuate

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
this pioneering spirit

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.260
with something that will be independent from fossil energy?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And this is when the project Solar Impulse

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
really started to

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
turn in my head.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And I think it's a nice metaphor also

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
for the 21st century.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Not to conquer the planet or space,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
not anymore, it has been done,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
but rather to improve the quality of life.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
How can we go through the ice of certainty

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.260
in order to make the most incredible a possible thing?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.260
What is today completely impossible --

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
get rid of our dependency on fossil energy.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
If you tell to people, we want to be independent

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
from fossil energy in our world,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
people will laugh at you, except here,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
where crazy people are invited to speak.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
(Laughter)

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
So, the idea is that if we fly around the world

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
in a solar powered airplane,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
using absolutely no fuel,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
nobody ever could say in the future

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
that it's impossible to do it

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
for cars, for heating systems,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
for computers, and so on and so on.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Well, solar power airplanes are not new.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
They have flown in the past, but without

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
saving capabilities, without batteries.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Which means that they have more proven

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
the limits of renewable energies

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
than the potential of it.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
If we want to show the potential,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
we have to fly day and night.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
That means to load the batteries during the flight,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
in order to spend the night on the batteries,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
and fly the next day again.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
It has been made, already, on remote controlled

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
little airplane models, without pilots.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
But it stays an anecdote

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
because the public couldn't identify to it.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
I think you need a pilot in the plane

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
that can talk to the universities,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
that can talk to students,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
talk to politicians during the flight,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and really make it a human adventure.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
For that, unfortunately,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
four meters wingspan is not enough.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
You need 64 meter wingspan.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.260
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
That's for sure.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
we can produce the same energy

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
than 200 little lightbulbs.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
with an airplane that uses

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
People will tell you it's impossible,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and that's exactly why we try to do it.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
six years ago.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
We have now 70 people in the team working on it.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.260
We have gone through the stages of simulation, design,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
computing, preparing the construction

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
of the first prototype.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
That has been achieved after two years of work.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Cockpit, propeller, engine.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
50 kilos for the entire fuselage.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
This is the complete structure of the airplane.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And one month ago we have unveiled it.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
You cannot imagine how it is for a team

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
who has been working six years on it

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
to show that it's not only a dream and a vision,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
it's a real airplane.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
A real airplane that we could finally present.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And what's the goal now?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.260
The goal is to take off,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
end of this year for the first test,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.260
but mainly next year, spring or summer,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
take off, on our own power,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
without additional help, without being towed,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
climb to 9,000 meters altitude.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
The same time we load the batteries,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.260
we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
we arrive at the beginning of the night.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And there, there will be just one goal, just one:

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
(Laughter)

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And this is exactly the symbol of our world.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
If our airplane is too heavy,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
if the pilot wastes energy,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
we'll never make it through the night.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
wasting our energy resources,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
if we keep on building things that consume so much energy

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.260
that most of the companies now go bankrupt,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
without a major problem.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
I don't think it will transport 200 people

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
in the next years.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
the payload was also just sufficient

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.260
for one person and some fuel.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
And 20 years later there were 200 people

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So, we have to start,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
and show the example.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
A little bit like on this picture here.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
This is a painting from Magritte,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
in the museum in Holland that I love so much.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
It's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
This is not an airplane.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
This is a symbol of what we can achieve

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
when we believe in the impossible,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
when we have a team,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
when we have pioneering spirit,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
and especially when we understand

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
that all the certainties we have

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
should be thrown overboard.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
What pleases me very much

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
around the world with no fuel

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
in order to have our message been understood.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
invited by politicians, invited in energy forums,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in order to show that it's not anymore

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
completely stupid

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
to think about getting rid of the dependency

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
on fossil energies.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
So, through speeches like this one today,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
through interviews, through meetings,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.260
our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
The success will not come

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
if we "just," quote, unquote,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
No, the success will come

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
if enough people are motivated

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
to do exactly the same in their daily life,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
save energy, go to renewables.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
we can save between 30 and 50 percent

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.260
of the energy of a country in Europe,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
It leaves 25 or 30 percent for

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.260
oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
This is acceptable.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.260
This is why all the people who believe

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
in this type of spirit

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
are welcome to be on that team.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
to just be informed of what we're doing.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
But much more, to get advices,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
to give your comments, to spread the word

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
that if it's possible in the air,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
of course it's possible in the ground.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.260
And each time we have some ice in the future,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
we have to know that life will be great,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
and the success will be brilliant

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
to go through the obstacle,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.260
So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
Everyone has his goal, has his dreams,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
has his visions.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
The question I leave you with now

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
is which is the ballast

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.260
you would like to throw overboard?

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Which will be the altitude at which

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.260
you would like to fly in your life,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
to get to the success that you wish to have,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
to get to the point that really belongs to you,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
with the potential you have,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
and the one you can really fulfill?

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Because the most renewable energy we have

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
is our own potential, and our own passion.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
in the wings of the future. Thank you.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:41.260
(Applause)
