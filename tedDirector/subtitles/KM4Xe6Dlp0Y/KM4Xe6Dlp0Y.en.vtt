00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.186
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.239
and for the last little while,
I've been a model.

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:26.604
Actually, for 10 years.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.406
And I feel like

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.230
there's an uncomfortable tension
in the room right now

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:35.277
because I should not have worn this dress.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.059
(Laughter)

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.557
So luckily, I brought an outfit change.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:43.206
This is the first outfit change
on the TED stage,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.252
so you guys are pretty lucky
to witness it, I think.

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:49.193
If some of the women were
really horrified when I came out,

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:52.360
you don't have to tell me now,
but I'll find out later on Twitter.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:55.604
(Laughter)

00:00:57.575 --> 00:00:59.433
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:02.511
to be able to transform
what you think of me

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.174
in a very brief 10 seconds.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.943
Not everybody gets to do that.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.494
These heels are very uncomfortable,
so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.020
The worst part is putting
this sweater over my head,

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.093
because that's when
you'll all laugh at me,

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:21.225
so don't do anything
while it's over my head.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:24.022
All right.

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:28.950
So, why did I do that?

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:30.180
That was awkward.

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:32.132
(Laughter)

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.267
Well --

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.657
(Laughter)

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:39.372
Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.324
Image is powerful,

00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:46.749
but also, image is superficial.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:52.715
I just totally transformed
what you thought of me, in six seconds.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:54.554
And in this picture,

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:57.125
I had actually never had
a boyfriend in real life.

00:01:57.903 --> 00:01:59.696
I was totally uncomfortable,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.198
and the photographer
was telling me to arch my back

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.917
and put my hand in that guy's hair.

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:08.249
And of course, barring surgery,

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:11.690
or the fake tan that I got
two days ago for work,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:15.451
there's very little that we can do
to transform how we look,

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:18.907
and how we look, though it is
superficial and immutable,

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:21.241
has a huge impact on our lives.

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:27.898
So today, for me, being
fearless means being honest.

00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:30.783
And I am on this stage
because I am a model.

00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:34.510
I am on this stage because
I am a pretty, white woman,

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:37.275
and in my industry,
we call that a sexy girl.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.146
I'm going to answer the questions
that people always ask me,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.468
but with an honest twist.

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:44.370
So the first question is,
how do you become a model?

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:46.403
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:47.585
but that means nothing.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.690
The real way that I became a model

00:02:50.714 --> 00:02:54.177
is I won a genetic lottery,
and I am the recipient of a legacy,

00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:56.297
and maybe you're wondering
what is a legacy.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.043
Well, for the past few centuries

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:04.561
we have defined beauty
not just as health and youth

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:08.347
and symmetry that we're biologically
programmed to admire,

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.883
but also as tall, slender figures,

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:15.130
and femininity and white skin.

00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:17.202
And this is a legacy
that was built for me,

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.676
and it's a legacy
that I've been cashing out on.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.730
And I know there are
people in the audience

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:23.446
who are skeptical at this point,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.947
and maybe there are
some fashionistas who are like,

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.490
"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:31.657
And first, I commend you on your model
knowledge. Very impressive.

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.313
(Laughter)

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:36.866
But unfortunately,
I have to inform you that in 2007,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.376
a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.002
counted all the models on the runway,
every single one that was hired,

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:46.130
and of the 677 models that were hired,

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:49.647
only 27, or less than four percent,
were non-white.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.830
The next question people always ask is,

00:03:52.854 --> 00:03:54.479
"Can I be a model when I grow up?"

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:58.137
And the first answer is, "I don't know,
they don't put me in charge of that."

00:03:58.161 --> 00:03:59.554
But the second answer,

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:02.332
and what I really want to say
to these little girls is,

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:04.346
"Why? You know? You can be anything.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.616
You could be the President
of the United States,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.417
or the inventor of the next Internet,

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.399
or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:13.090
which would be awesome,
because you'd be the first one."

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:15.276
(Laughter)

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.634
If, after this amazing list,
they still are like,

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:19.563
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:21.201
well, then I say, "Be my boss."

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.091
Because I'm not in charge of anything,

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:25.642
and you could be the editor in chief
of American Vogue

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.802
or the CEO of H&amp;M,
or the next Steven Meisel.

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.672
Saying that you want to be
a model when you grow up

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:34.030
is akin to saying that you want to win
the Powerball when you grow up.

00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:37.474
It's out of your control,
and it's awesome,

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:38.900
and it's not a career path.

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:43.543
I will demonstrate for you now
10 years of accumulated model knowledge,

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.472
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:48.198
it can just be distilled right now.

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:51.282
So, if the photographer is right there,

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:53.363
the light is right there, like a nice HMI,

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:55.534
and the client says,
"We want a walking shot,"

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:59.242
this leg goes first, nice and long,
this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.184
the head is at three quarters,
and you just go back and forth,

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.208
just do that, and then you look back
at your imaginary friends,

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:06.951
300, 400, 500 times.

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:08.655
(Laughter)

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:10.466
It will look something like this.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.677
(Laughter)

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.629
Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:18.204
That was -- I don't know
what happened there.

00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:20.335
Unfortunately,
after you've gone to school,

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:22.689
and you have a résumé
and you've done a few jobs,

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:24.205
you can't say anything anymore,

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.276
so if you say you want to be
the President of the United States,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.706
but your résumé reads,
"Underwear Model: 10 years,"

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.136
people give you a funny look.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.748
The next question is,
"Do they retouch all the photos?"

00:05:33.772 --> 00:05:36.153
And yeah, they pretty much
retouch all the photos,

00:05:36.177 --> 00:05:38.786
but that is only a small component
of what's happening.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.984
This picture is the very first
picture that I ever took,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.817
and it's also the very first time
that I had worn a bikini,

00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:46.621
and I didn't even have my period yet.

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:49.772
I know we're getting personal,
but I was a young girl.

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:53.046
This is what I looked like with my grandma
just a few months earlier.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.452
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.

00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:57.820
My friend got to come.

00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:01.092
Here's me at a slumber party
a few days before I shot French Vogue.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.553
Here's me on the soccer team
and in V Magazine.

00:06:06.047 --> 00:06:07.483
And here's me today.

00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:09.543
And I hope what you're seeing

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.741
is that these pictures
are not pictures of me.

00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:13.179
They are constructions,

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:16.107
and they are constructions
by a group of professionals,

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.227
by hairstylists and makeup artists
and photographers and stylists

00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.443
and all of their assistants
and pre-production and post-production,

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:23.475
and they build this.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:24.569
That's not me.

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.990
Okay, so the next question
people always ask me is,

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:28.340
"Do you get free stuff?"

00:06:28.364 --> 00:06:29.410
(Laughter)

00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:32.681
I do have too many 8-inch heels
which I never get to wear,

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.300
except for earlier,

00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:37.785
but the free stuff that I get
is the free stuff that I get in real life,

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:40.039
and that's what we don't like
to talk about.

00:06:40.063 --> 00:06:41.330
I grew up in Cambridge,

00:06:41.354 --> 00:06:43.926
and one time I went into a store
and I forgot my money

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.058
and they gave me the dress for free.

00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:48.578
When I was a teenager,
I was driving with my friend

00:06:48.602 --> 00:06:51.269
who was an awful driver
and she ran a red and of course,

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:52.482
we got pulled over,

00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:56.313
and all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"
and we were on our way.

00:06:57.623 --> 00:07:00.805
And I got these free things
because of how I look,

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.624
not who I am, and there are
people paying a cost

00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:05.866
for how they look and not who they are.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.510
I live in New York, and last year,

00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:11.313
of the 140,000 teenagers
that were stopped and frisked,

00:07:11.337 --> 00:07:15.352
86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.

00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:19.838
And there are only 177,000
young black and Latino men in New York,

00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:22.577
so for them, it's not a question
of, "Will I get stopped?"

00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:25.659
but "How many times will I get stopped?
When will I get stopped?"

00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:27.255
When I was researching this talk,

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:30.434
I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
in the United States,

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:33.121
53% don't like their bodies,

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:36.114
and that number goes to 78%
by the time that they're 17.

00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:40.139
So, the last question people ask me is,

00:07:40.163 --> 00:07:41.763
"What is it like to be a model?"

00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:44.170
And I think the answer
that they're looking for is,

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:47.114
"If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,

00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:49.911
you will be so happy and fabulous."

00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:51.470
And when we're backstage,

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:54.017
we give an answer
that maybe makes it seem like that.

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:57.521
We say, "It's really amazing to travel,
and it's amazing to get to work

00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:00.145
with creative, inspired,
passionate people."

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:03.312
And those things are true,
but they're only one half of the story,

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:05.914
because the thing
that we never say on camera,

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:08.010
that I have never said on camera, is,

00:08:08.034 --> 00:08:09.406
"I am insecure."

00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:14.566
And I'm insecure because I have to think
about what I look like every day.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.832
And if you ever are wondering,

00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:22.786
"If I have thinner thighs
and shinier hair, will I be happier?"

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.715
you just need to meet a group of models,

00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:28.665
because they have the thinnest thighs,
the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:32.132
and they're the most physically
insecure women probably on the planet.

00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:33.538
When I was writing this talk,

00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:36.531
I found it very difficult
to strike an honest balance,

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:37.989
because on the one hand,

00:08:38.013 --> 00:08:40.425
I felt very uncomfortable
to come out here and say,

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:44.044
"Look I've received all these benefits
from a deck stacked in my favor,"

00:08:44.068 --> 00:08:47.259
and it also felt really uncomfortable
to follow that up with,

00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:49.647
"and it doesn't always make me happy."

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:55.546
But mostly it was difficult to unpack
a legacy of gender and racial oppression

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.678
when I am one
of the biggest beneficiaries.

00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:01.539
But I'm also happy
and honored to be up here

00:09:01.563 --> 00:09:04.775
and I think that it's great
that I got to come

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.472
before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
and I'd had more agency in my career,

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:11.970
because maybe then I wouldn't tell
the story of how I got my first job,

00:09:11.994 --> 00:09:14.867
or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
of how I paid for college,

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.564
which seems so important right now.

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:19.232
If there's a takeaway to this talk,

00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:22.859
I hope it's that we all feel
more comfortable acknowledging

00:09:22.883 --> 00:09:26.826
the power of image
in our perceived successes

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.726
and our perceived failures.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.102
Thank you.

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.230
