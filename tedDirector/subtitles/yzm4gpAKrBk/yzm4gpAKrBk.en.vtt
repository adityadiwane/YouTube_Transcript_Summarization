00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.464
I want you to imagine this for a moment.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:21.359
Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.217
living in the same neighborhood,

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:26.512
from the same educational background, similar occupation,

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:29.280
and they both turn up at their local accident emergency

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.096
complaining of acute chest pain.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:35.220
Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.031
but Rajiv is sent home.

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:40.541
What might explain the difference in the experience

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.793
of these two nearly identical men?

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:47.280
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.379
The difference in the quality of medical care

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.240
received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.155
why they live shorter lives

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.738
than people without mental illness.

00:00:56.738 --> 00:00:59.408
Even in the best-resourced countries in the world,

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:04.178
this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:06.103
In the developing countries of the world, this gap

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.728
is even larger.

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:11.587
But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:14.948
as well. The most obvious example is suicide.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.603
It might surprise some of you here, as it did me,

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:20.540
when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.105
of the leading causes of death in young people

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:24.753
in all countries in the world,

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:28.145
including the poorest countries of the world.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.979
But beyond the impact of a health condition

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.349
on life expectancy, we're also concerned

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.043
about the quality of life lived.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:38.292
Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.665
of a health condition both on life expectancy

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:43.823
as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use

00:01:43.823 --> 00:01:45.209
a metric called the DALY,

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.496
which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.017
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:54.839
about mental illness from a global perspective.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.103
We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:02.691
amongst the leading causes of disability around the world.

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.426
Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:08.398
of disability, alongside conditions such as

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:11.750
diarrhea and pneumonia in children.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.854
When you put all the mental illnesses together,

00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:16.116
they account for roughly 15 percent

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:19.322
of the total global burden of disease.

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:23.833
Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:29.278
to people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:31.990
let us consider the absolute numbers.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.049
The World Health Organization estimates

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.154
that there are nearly four to five hundred million people

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:39.337
living on our tiny planet

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:40.998
who are affected by a mental illness.

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:42.717
Now some of you here

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:45.315
look a bit astonished by that number,

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:47.808
but consider for a moment the incredible diversity

00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:50.962
of mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.643
in childhood, through to depression and anxiety,

00:02:53.643 --> 00:02:55.924
substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:57.560
all the way through to dementia in old age,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.514
and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:03.866
present here today can think of at least one person,

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:07.188
at least one person, who's affected by mental illness

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:11.619
in our most intimate social networks.

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.824
I see some nodding heads there.

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:17.794
But beyond the staggering numbers,

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:20.803
what's truly important from a global health point of view,

00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:23.348
what's truly worrying from a global health point of view,

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:26.516
is that the vast majority of these affected individuals

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:28.525
do not receive the care

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.991
that we know can transform their lives, and remember,

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:34.052
we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.504
medicines, psychological interventions,

00:03:36.504 --> 00:03:39.992
and social interventions, can make a vast difference.

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:42.243
And yet, even in the best-resourced countries,

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:45.178
for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent

00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:48.295
of affected people don't receive these interventions.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.612
In the sorts of countries I work in,

00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:52.762
that so-called treatment gap

00:03:52.762 --> 00:03:57.649
approaches an astonishing 90 percent.

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.861
It isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak

00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:03.292
to anyone affected by a mental illness,

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:06.104
the chances are that you will hear stories

00:04:06.104 --> 00:04:10.154
of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:13.103
in nearly every sector of their lives.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:15.813
But perhaps most heartbreaking of all

00:04:15.813 --> 00:04:18.502
are the stories of the abuse

00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:21.034
of even the most basic human rights,

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:23.891
such as the young woman shown in this image here

00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.955
that are played out every day,

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:29.899
sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.734
for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:36.762
It's this injustice that has really driven my mission

00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.154
to try to do a little bit to transform the lives

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.900
of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.749
critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.535
between the knowledge we have that can transform lives,

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:50.977
the knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually

00:04:50.977 --> 00:04:54.399
use that knowledge in the everyday world.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.558
And an especially important challenge that I've had to face

00:04:57.558 --> 00:05:00.483
is the great shortage of mental health professionals,

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:02.155
such as psychiatrists and psychologists,

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:04.943
particularly in the developing world.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:07.628
Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:11.047
I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay

00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:13.275
of my mother and all my family members who

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:14.978
kind of thought neurosurgery would be

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:18.147
a more respectable option for their brilliant son.

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:20.881
Any case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,

00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.176
and found myself training in Britain in some of

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.551
the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.

00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:29.094
I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:32.345
but most importantly, highly trained, specialized

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:34.536
mental health professionals.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.508
Soon after my training, I found myself working

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:38.951
first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted

00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:41.811
by an altogether new reality.

00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:45.157
This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.522
mental health professionals at all.

00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:49.556
In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:52.616
a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:54.742
in Harare city, leaving only a couple

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:57.135
to address the mental health care needs

00:05:57.135 --> 00:06:00.803
of nine million people living in the countryside.

00:06:00.803 --> 00:06:04.420
In India, I found the situation was not a lot better.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.843
To give you a perspective, if I had to translate

00:06:06.843 --> 00:06:09.051
the proportion of psychiatrists in the population

00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.433
that one might see in Britain to India,

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:17.042
one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:20.073
In reality, take a guess.

00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:22.638
The actual number is about 3,000,

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:25.102
about two percent of that number.

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:27.599
It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.660
the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.599
one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.131
mental health professionals to provide mental health care

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:38.591
in countries like India and Zimbabwe.

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:41.244
I had to think out of the box about some other model

00:06:41.244 --> 00:06:42.867
of care.

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:45.980
It was then that I came across these books,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.223
and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting

00:06:49.223 --> 00:06:51.291
in global health.

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.567
The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.581
when you're short of specialized health care professionals,

00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:59.630
use whoever is available in the community,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.567
train them to provide a range of health care interventions,

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:05.435
and in these books I read inspiring examples,

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.371
for example of how ordinary people had been trained

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:09.724
to deliver babies,

00:07:09.724 --> 00:07:13.355
diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:16.106
And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:18.330
to deliver such complex health care interventions,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.403
then perhaps they could also do the same

00:07:20.403 --> 00:07:22.395
with mental health care.

00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:25.264
Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you

00:07:25.264 --> 00:07:28.376
that there have been many experiments in task shifting

00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:31.147
in mental health care across the developing world

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:33.210
over the past decade, and I want to share with you

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.907
the findings of three particular such experiments,

00:07:35.907 --> 00:07:37.994
all three of which focused on depression,

00:07:37.994 --> 00:07:40.429
the most common of all mental illnesses.

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:43.771
In rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,

00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:47.615
using villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:49.970
interpersonal psychotherapy for depression

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.642
and, using a randomized control design,

00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:54.887
showed that 90 percent of the people receiving

00:07:54.887 --> 00:07:56.847
this intervention recovered as compared

00:07:56.847 --> 00:08:00.388
to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:04.528
Similarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,

00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:06.868
Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed

00:08:06.868 --> 00:08:09.603
that lady health visitors, who are community maternal

00:08:09.603 --> 00:08:12.392
health workers in Pakistan's health care system,

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:14.609
could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers

00:08:14.609 --> 00:08:17.117
who were depressed, again showing dramatic differences

00:08:17.117 --> 00:08:19.964
in the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers

00:08:19.964 --> 00:08:22.529
recovered as compared to about 45 percent

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.813
in the comparison villages.

00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:27.899
And in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:30.427
that lay counselors drawn from local communities

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.111
could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions

00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:35.693
for depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent

00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:37.776
recovery rates as compared to 50 percent

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:40.982
in the comparison primary health centers.

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:42.951
Now, if I had to draw together all these different

00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:45.483
experiments in task shifting, and there have of course

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.857
been many other examples, and try and identify

00:08:47.857 --> 00:08:49.875
what are the key lessons we can learn that makes

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.953
for a successful task shifting operation,

00:08:52.953 --> 00:08:56.809
I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.

00:08:56.809 --> 00:09:01.043
What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."

00:09:01.043 --> 00:09:03.258
It seems to me that there are five key lessons

00:09:03.258 --> 00:09:05.857
that I've shown on this slide that are critically important

00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:08.040
for effective task shifting.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.066
The first is that we need to simplify the message

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.450
that we're using, stripping away all the jargon

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.771
that medicine has invented around itself.

00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.728
We need to unpack complex health care interventions

00:09:19.728 --> 00:09:21.956
into smaller components that can be more easily

00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:24.611
transferred to less-trained individuals.

00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:27.178
We need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,

00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:29.404
but close to people's homes, and we need to deliver

00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:32.176
health care using whoever is available and affordable

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:34.557
in our local communities.

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.437
And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists

00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:39.505
who are available to perform roles

00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:42.983
such as capacity-building and supervision.

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.315
Now for me, task shifting is an idea

00:09:45.315 --> 00:09:48.274
with truly global significance,

00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:50.807
because even though it has arisen out of the

00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:54.305
situation of the lack of resources that you find

00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:57.264
in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance

00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.145
for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?

00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:03.665
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world,

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:06.140
the health care costs in the [developed] world,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.717
are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:12.137
of those costs are human resource costs.

00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:14.623
But equally important is because health care has become

00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:18.460
so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.215
and removed from local communities.

00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:24.937
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:26.583
though, isn't that it simply makes health care

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:29.741
more accessible and affordable but that

00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:32.297
it is also fundamentally empowering.

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:35.929
It empowers ordinary people to be more effective

00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:38.752
in caring for the health of others in their community,

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:40.241
and in doing so, to become better guardians

00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:43.523
of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting

00:10:43.523 --> 00:10:46.210
is the ultimate example of the democratization

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.459
of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:54.910
Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.883
at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.

00:10:57.883 --> 00:10:59.488
Well, I think all of you can guess

00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:03.203
that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.

00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:05.868
Still, today, armed with that knowledge

00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:08.524
that ordinary people in the community

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:11.687
can be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,

00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:14.959
can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:18.840
perhaps that promise is within reach now.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.484
Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,

00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:24.270
we will need to involve all

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.929
in that particular journey,

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:28.875
and in the case of mental health, in particular we would

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:31.778
need to involve people who are affected by mental illness

00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.232
and their caregivers.

00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:35.768
It is for this reason that, some years ago,

00:11:35.768 --> 00:11:37.686
the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded

00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:41.709
as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:44.516
like myself and people affected by mental illness

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:47.228
could stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.714
and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness

00:11:49.714 --> 00:11:52.931
to receive the care that we know can transform their lives,

00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:55.940
and to live a life with dignity.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.457
And in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet

00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:02.283
in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,

00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:05.037
spare a thought for that person you thought about

00:12:05.037 --> 00:12:07.614
who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about

00:12:07.614 --> 00:12:09.202
who have mental illness,

00:12:09.202 --> 00:12:13.006
and dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:17.070
