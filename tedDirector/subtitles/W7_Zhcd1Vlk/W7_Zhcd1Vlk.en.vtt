00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
You know, I am so bad at tech

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
that my daughter -- who is now 41 --

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
when she was five, was overheard by me

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
to say to a friend of hers,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
If it doesn't bleed when you cut it,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
my daddy doesn't understand it.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160
(Laughter)

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
So, the assignment I've been given 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
may be an insuperable obstacle for me,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
but I'm certainly going to try.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
What have I heard

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
during these last four days?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
This is my third visit to TED.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
was a regular TED two years ago.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
and what that is is an interweaving

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and an interlarding, an intermixing,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
of a sense of social responsibility

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
in so many of the talks --

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
global responsibility, in fact,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
appealing to enlightened self-interest,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
One of the most impressive things

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
about what some, perhaps 10,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
of the speakers have been talking about

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
It's: This is what I have done

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
because I'm excited by it,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
It's the old concept, the real Greek concept,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
of philanthropy in its original sense:

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
And the only explanation I can have

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And this gives me enormous hope.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And hope, of course, is the topic

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
that I'm supposed to be speaking about,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
And when I did, I thought,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
none of which really hits you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
between the eyes as being the appropriate one.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And, of course, that makes sense,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
it's not a concrete word.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And that's the way it is with definitions of words.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
and Joe Schmo does it one way

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
and Will Blow does it another way,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
They all come down to the idea of an expectation

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
of something good that is due to happen.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And you know what I found out?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
The Indo-European root of the word hope

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
is a stem, K-E-U --

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.160
we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy --

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
But what it means in the original Indo-European

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
is a change in direction, going in a different way.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
And I find that very interesting and very provocative,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
is the sense of going in different directions:

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
directions that are specific and unique to problems.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
There are different paradigms.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
You've heard that word several times in the last four days,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
So, when we think of hope now,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
we have to think of looking in other directions

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
than we have been looking.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
that has always appealed to me, and it was one by VÃ¡clav Havel

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,"

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
in which he says that hope

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
does not consist of the expectation that things will

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
come out exactly right,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
but the expectation that they will make sense

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
regardless of how they come out.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
I can't tell you how reassured I was

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
by the very last sentence

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I wasn't sure I heard it right,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care. 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
He said, "I think so."

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.160
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.160
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
I don't mean anything supernatural --

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
certainly not coming from this skeptic.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
What I mean is this ability

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
that each of us has

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.160
to be something greater than herself or himself;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
On an elemental level, we have all felt

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
that spirituality at the time of childbirth.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
Some of you have felt it in laboratories;

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
some of you have felt it at the workbench.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
We feel it at concerts.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And I think that it's going to be, in time,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
And if there's anything that has permeated this room,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
it is precisely that.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
I'm intrigued by

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
a concept that was brought to life

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
in the early part of the 19th century --

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.160
actually, in the second decade of the 19th century --

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
by a 27-year-old poet

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
whose name was Percy Shelley.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Now, we all think that Shelley

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
many of us tend to forget that he wrote

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
some perfectly wonderful essays, too,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
and the most well-remembered essay

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
is one called "A Defence of Poetry."

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.160
but somewhere on the second page

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
he begins talking about the notion

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
that he calls "moral imagination."

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
And here's what he says, roughly translated:

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
A man -- generic man --

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
a man, to be greatly good,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
must imagine clearly.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
He must see himself and the world

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
through the eyes of another,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
and of many others.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.160
See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
What is it that is expected of us

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
by the billions of people

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
so appropriately called

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
despair and disparity?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.160
What is it that they have every right

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
to ask of us?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Well, you know precisely what it is.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
There's a great deal of argument

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160
about whether we, as the great nation that we are,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
should be the policeman of the world,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
the world's constabulary,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
but there should be virtually no argument

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.160
about whether we should be the world's healer.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
There has certainly been no argument about that

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.160
in this room in the past four days.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
So, if we are to be the world's healer,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
every disadvantaged person in this world --

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.160
including in the United States -- becomes our patient.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
becomes our patient.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.160
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:11.160
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.160
and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen --

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.160
we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.160
it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient --

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.160
the world, and the disadvantaged of the world --

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.160
that patient deserves our compassion.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.160
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
is our moral imagination

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
and our identification with each individual

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
who lives in that world,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
not to think of them as a huge forest,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
but as individual trees.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get --

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
can get in the way.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
(Laughter)

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
So, here we are.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
We are, should be,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
morally committed to

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.160
being the healer of the world.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And we have had examples over and over and over again --

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.160
you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes --

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.160
of people who have not only had that commitment,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
but had the charisma, the brilliance --

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God --

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
of their quest,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
and who no doubt will continue to succeed,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
Now, if we're talking

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
about medicine,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
and we're talking about healing,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Pogo's been quoted;

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
I would like to quote one of my own household gods.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
I suspect he never really said this,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
because we don't know what Hippocrates really said,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
said the following,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160
and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.160
and the book is called "Precepts."

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
And I'll read you what it is.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Remember, I have been talking about,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
essentially philanthropy:

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.160
the love of humankind, the individual humankind

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
and the individual humankind 

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
that can bring that kind of love

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
translated into action,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160
And here he is, 2,400 years ago:

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.160
"Where there is love of humankind,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
there is love of healing."

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
We have seen that here today

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
with the sense,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
with the sensitivity --

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
and in the last three days,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
Thank you very much.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
(Applause)
