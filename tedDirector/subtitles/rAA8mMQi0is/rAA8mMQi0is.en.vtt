00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
The moment I say "school,"

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
so many memories come back to me.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It's like after every exam,
when I walk out,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
How did you do?"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I would say with a great smile,
"I will definitely pass."

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And I didn't understand why,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.022
in the other hand, when you say
the truth, they hated you.

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.260
So it went on like that,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and I didn't know where
else to find myself.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So I remember those nights

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
I used to go to sleep

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
with asking help from [the] Unknown

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
because, for some reason,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.356
I couldn't believe
what my father and mother

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.260
hanged in the Puja room as a god,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
because my friend's family

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
had something else as a god.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.594
So I thought, "I guess
I'll pray to [the] Unknown

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:05.260
and ask help,"

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and started getting help from everywhere,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
each and every corner
of my life at that time.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.499
My brothers started giving me
a few tips about drawing and painting.

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:17.260
Then, when I was in eighth standard

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
around 13 years old,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I started working in a part-time job

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
in one of the signboard
artists called Putu.

00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:30.260
And then school also
started supporting me.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
"Oh, he's bad at studies,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
but let him send
to the drawing competitions."

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So it was good to survive
with that little tool

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that I found to find
my own place in school.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And one of those competitions,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I just won a small,
little transistor Philips radio.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And I didn't have the patience to wait

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
until I reached home.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.308
So I just switched
on in the train, loudly.

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:55.260
If you travel in Indian trains,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
you can see people listening to radio

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and, you know, even from their mobiles.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So at that time -- and I was 13 --

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and I was listening to just radio,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and someone happened to sit next to me,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
like these three people are sitting here.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
You know, like just adjacent to me.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.594
He just started asking, "Where did
you buy the radio? How much is it?"

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:16.260
I said, "It's a prize
from [an] art competition."

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And he said, "Oh, I teach
at a college of arts.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I think

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
you should study in a school of art.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
You just quit school and come there."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
So, why I'm telling you this,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
you know, maybe, you know,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.832
whoever is sitting next to you can
change your whole life -- it's possible.

00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:35.856
It is that we need we need
to be open and fine-tuned.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So that's what made me enter

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
[the] college of arts after three attempts

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and just continue to inquire

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
what I really want to do
with art work, or art

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and finally I'm here in front of you.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
When I look back, you know,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
on what happened between that time

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and now here --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the last 10/15 years --

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
I can see that most of the works

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
revolve around three subjects,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
but it was not intentional.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And I just start out with a trace
because I was thinking,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
"What really makes us?" -- you know,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
it's actually [the] past,
what makes a person.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So I was thinking,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
but when you look at the past,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
the way to understand the past

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
is only by the traces available,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
because we cannot go back [to] the past.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It can be ruins, or it can be music,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
or it can be painting or drawing
or writing, whatever it is.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
But it is just a kind
of trace of that time.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And that fascinated me,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to explore that territory.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So I was working on the line,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
but instead of working about traces,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
I started capturing traces.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So here are some of the works
I would like to show you.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
So this is called "Self In Progress."

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
It's just a trace of being in this body.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So here, what happened then,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is that this sculpture

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
is nothing but a trace of myself.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
It's almost like a 3D photograph.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
So there is an element of performance,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and there is an element of sculpture,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.594
and there is an element of feeling
one's self, so close to one's self.

00:04:18.618 --> 00:04:21.260
So it's almost like fossils
for the future.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And then moved slowly

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
to explore the other possibilities
of capturing traces.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
So this is what I was talking
about, while molding,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
it's such a great experience,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
because we have freedom of like walking,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
or moving my hand or,
moving around in the space,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
but the moment this becomes solid,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
when you cannot move even an inch,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.927
because this is plaster of Paris, so
the moment you pour it it's like liquid;

00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.951
but after 20 minutes,
it's almost like a hard stone.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So this is capturing
the trace of a thumbprint

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
because, knowingly or unknowingly,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
whatever we do, you know,
we leave our traces here.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
thumbprint, footprint,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
or whatever traces we leave as humans."

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
This is the trace of fire,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
this is the trace of sun.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.451
Because when I was capturing
traces, you know,

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:20.260
this thought comes to me always:

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is it, only when the object touches
the thing and it leaves the trace,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
or is there other ways to capture it?"

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So this work is nothing but like --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
because of the focal length of the lens,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
it just shows what is on the other side.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.356
So I just put the paper
on the focal length,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.260
which was an etching print,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
then I got the portrait
of [the] sun from sunlight.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
What I did here, I just put
like 10 feet [of] paper

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
then put a coconut rope,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and just burnt it.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.308
So it took about 24
hours to get this line.

00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.308
So wherever the fire is eating the paper,

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:56.260
that's what becomes the work --

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
detail.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Even though we have traces

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
when we try to understand them,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
the perception and context

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
play a major role to understand it.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
So do we really understand what it is,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
or are we trying to get

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
what we think it is?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.356
Then move towards questioning
the perception

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.260
because, even though there are traces,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.308
when you try to understand them,
you know you play a major role.

00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:28.260
So like let's say even a simple act.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
How many of you saw
a cow crossing in India

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.499
while you were coming
from Bangalore to Mysore?

00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:36.260
Can you just raise the hand?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
If you just ask an opinion

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
of how, everyone can interpret it.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.451
she'll simply say, "To
get to the other side."

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:48.260
Why the cow was crossing
the road, you know.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
The answer can be so
different if Potter said it.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
He would say, "For the greater good."

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Martin Luther King would say,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
"I imagine a world where
all cows will be free

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
to cross the road,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
without having their motives
called into question."

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
(Laughter)

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
the same cow walking around the street.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
He would definitely say,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
"God came down from heaven,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and he said unto the cow,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
'Thou shalt cross the road.'

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And cow crossed the road,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and there was much
rejoicing as a holy cow."

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
(Laughter)

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Freud would say,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
"The fact that you're at all concerned

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
reveals your underlying
sexual insecurity."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
(Laughter)

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
If we ask Einstein,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
he would say, "Whether
the cow crossed the road,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
or the road moved underneath the cow,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
depends on your frame of reference."

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
(Laughter)

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Or Buddha --

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
if he saw the same cow, he would say,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
"Asking this question denies
your own nature [as a] cow."

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
(Laughter)

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
So, what we see

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
is just what we think often,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and most of the time,
we don't see what it is.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
It just all depends on one's perception.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And context, what is really context?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
You know, I could just show you
this little piece of paper.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Because I always think meaning
doesn't really exist.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.022
The meaning of what we create
in this world doesn't exist.

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:26.260
It's just created by the mind.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
If you look at this piece of paper,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
this is the breadth

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and this is called length.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
This is how we've been taught in school.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
But if you tear it in the middle --

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
now, I didn't touch this breadth,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
but still, the meaning of this changes.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So what we conceive as a meaning

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
is always not there;

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
it's on the other side,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
even when we say dark, light,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
good, bad, tall, short --

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
It's just that being a human,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
the way we train to perceive the reality

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
creates this meaning.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So this work from this period

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
is mostly like --

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.689
you know, this is a work
called "Light Makes Dark."

00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:13.260
It's just captured through from the lamp.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.499
So the lamp is not just giving
a light, it's also giving a darkness.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:19.523
So this is a work of art,
which is just trying to explore that.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
This is called "Limit Out."

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
This shows how limited our eye
or hearing sense or touch --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
do we really see?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This is an exact negative.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
It's about six inches deep in the wall,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but it just appears
like it's coming out of the wall.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
You know the wall is almost like --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.499
this is the first skin,
and this is the second,

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:43.785
and there's a third,
and each creates a meaning.

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:46.260
And we're just pulling
the wall off the gallery.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Again, "Inward Out."

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
It's a full-figure cast from myself.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
It's about eight inches deep.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
When I was doing that, I always wondered
since I've worked with creators --

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and now you know, I've moved
to questioning the perception --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
it just makes me feel like:

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is there anything behind,
are there any traces up there,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
which as a human, we don't see them?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Is there any way to capture the thought

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
into visual art?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
I couldn't find it.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
But a solution arrived

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
after being quiet and not working
for about six, seven months,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
in the restroom,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
when I was changing the air freshener

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that goes from solid substance to vapor.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
It's called Odonil.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
This is the work I made
out of that material.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.927
The process to get to make
the sculpture was interesting,

00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:46.260
because I wrote to Balsara,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
who produces that air
freshener called Odonil,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist.
This is my catalogue.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
They never wrote back to me.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Then I thought, "I will go
to the Small Scale Industries

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Facilitating Unit and ask help."

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
So I told them, "I'd like to start
an air freshener company."

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
They said, "Of course.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
This is the fee for the project report,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.784
and we will give you
all the details," and they gave.

00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:12.260
Finally, I went back to them and said,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.403
"It's not for starting the company,
it's just to make my own work.

00:11:15.427 --> 00:11:17.260
Please come for the show."

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
And they did.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And this work is in the Devi
Art Foundation in Delhi.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
In India, nobody really
talks about works of art;

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
they always talk
about the appreciation of art.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
You buy this for 3,000 rupees,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
it'll become 30,000 in two months.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
This is the craft that was going on,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
but there are a few collectors

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
who also collect art which can depreciate.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And this was collected by Anupam --

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.165
which is like, finally in the end,
he will not have anything,

00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:45.189
because it will evaporate.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
So this is after a few weeks,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
this is after a few months.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
It's just all about questioning
the preconceptions.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So if someone says, "Oh,
I see the portrait,"

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.451
it may not be the portrait
after a few months.

00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:01.260
And if they say it's solid,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
it will not be solid, it will evaporate.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And if they say they don't get it,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
that's also not true,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
because it's in the air.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.499
It's in the same gallery
or in the same museum.

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.260
So they inhaled it,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
but they are not aware of it.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
While I was doing that work,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
my mom and my dad,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
they were looking at it and they said,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
"Why do you deal with negative
subjects all the time?"

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And I was like, "What do you mean?"

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
"Light makes dark and now
evaporating self.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
Don't you think it remained
something about death," they said.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
"this is tucked in some small solid,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
but the moment it evaporates,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
it's merged with the whole."

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Can you make something from nothing

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
as a sculptor?"

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Because we can create

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
a sculpture

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
by gathering dust together,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
or we can break the sculpture
and get the dust,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
but there is nowhere that we can
bring dust into the universe."

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
So, I did this work for her.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
It's called "Emerging Angel."

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
This is the first day --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
it just gives the appearance

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
that one is becoming the other.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
So, the same sculpture

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
after a few days.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
This is after 15/20 days.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
Through that small little slit

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
between the glass box and the wood,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.308
the air goes underneath the sculpture
and creates the other one.

00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:32.260
This gave me a greater faith.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
That evaporating sculpture
gave me a greater faith

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.308
that maybe there
is many more possibilities

00:13:37.332 --> 00:13:39.260
to capture [the] invisible.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So what you see now

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
is called "Shadow Foreshadow."

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And what I'd like to tell you

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
is we don't see shadow,
and we don't see light too;

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
we see the source of the light.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.403
We see where it's bouncing,
but we don't see [them] as they exist.

00:13:54.427 --> 00:13:57.260
You know, that's why the night
sky, we see the sky as dark,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
but it's filled with light all the time.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
The same thing in the darkroom.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
The little dust particle
will again, reflect the light,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
and we realize the existence of light.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
we don't see gravity,
we don't see electricity.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
So, I just started doing this work

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
to inquire further

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
about how to sculpt

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
the space between this object and there.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.594
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm
seeing this and I'm seeing that --

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.260
but how to sculpt this, you know?

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
If we sculpt this, this
has two reference points.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
The skin of this is also
representing this.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
And skin at the other end
also represents the floor.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
I did this as an experiment

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
of casting the shadow.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So this is a corrugated
box and its shadow.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Then the second one --

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
the moment you bring any invisible
into the visible world

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
it will have all the characteristics
of the visible existence.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
So that produced a shadow.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Then, again, that becomes an object.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Again, throwing light, then the third one.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So what you see is nothing but shadow

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
of a shadow of a shadow.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
And then again, at that point,
there is no shadow.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
You can see the detail.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
This is called "Gravity."

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
It's called "Breath." It's just
two holes on the gallery wall.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
It's a false wall, which contains

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
like 110 cubic feet.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
So that hole actually

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
makes the air come out and go in.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
So where it's happening, we can see,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.594
but what is happening
will remain invisible only.

00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:48.594
This is from the show called
"Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:50.260
This is called "Kaayam."

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Detail.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And what I'd like to tell you,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
our senses are so limited --

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
we cannot hear everything,
we cannot see everything.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
but if the breeze is a little more
faster, then I can feel it.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
So all of our construction of reality

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
is through these limited senses.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
So my request was like,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
is there any way to use all this

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
as just a symbol or a sign?

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And to really get to the point,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
we should move beyond, you know,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.499
go to the other side
of the wall, like illogic,

00:16:27.523 --> 00:16:29.260
like are invisible.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
Because when we see someone
walks, we see the footprint.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
But if we're just cutting that footprint
from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
you will miss the point

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
because the actual journey happens
between those footprints,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.546
and the footprints are nothing
but passing time.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.260
Thank you.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
(Applause)
