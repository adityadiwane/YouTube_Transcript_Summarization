00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:18.229
So let me ask for a show of hands.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.421
How many people here are over the age of 48?

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.302
Well, there do seem to be a few.

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:27.477
Well, congratulations,

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:31.347
because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:34.445
you are now in excess of the average life span

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.232
of somebody who was born in 1900.

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:40.766
But look what happened in the course of that century.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.428
If you follow that curve,

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:45.042
you'll see that it starts way down there.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.511
There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.933
And here we are at 2010,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.989
average life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.885
and we are not done yet.

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.220
Now, that's the good news.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.061
But there's still a lot of work to do.

00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:59.695
So, for instance, if you ask,

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.421
how many diseases do we now know

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:04.480
the exact molecular basis?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.038
Turns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,

00:01:08.038 --> 00:01:10.274
because most of those molecular discoveries

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.939
have just happened in the last little while.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.235
It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.342
but how many of those 4,000 diseases

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:20.690
now have treatments available?

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.578
Only about 250.

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:25.336
So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:27.916
You would think this wouldn't be too hard,

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:29.442
that we would simply have the ability

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.468
to take this fundamental information that we're learning

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:35.613
about how it is that basic biology teaches us

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.515
about the causes of disease

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.541
and build a bridge across this yawning gap

00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.921
between what we've learned about basic science

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:44.416
and its application,

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.673
a bridge that would look maybe something like this,

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:51.285
where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:54.253
to get from one side to the other.

00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:56.853
Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?

00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:58.998
Unfortunately, it's not.

00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.589
In reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:04.253
to its application is more like this.

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:06.168
There are no shiny bridges.

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.820
You sort of place your bets.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.781
Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.305
and a sailboat and a tugboat

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.033
and you set them off on their way,

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.697
and the rains come and the lightning flashes,

00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:17.211
and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water

00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.232
and the swimmer gets into trouble,

00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:20.816
and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:24.028
and the sailboat capsized,

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.729
and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.369
and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.358
Well, what does this really look like?

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.412
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:35.413
What's a drug? A drug is made up

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.738
of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,

00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:39.989
oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.212
all cobbled together in a shape,

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:44.589
and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.902
that particular drug is going to hit its target.

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:50.125
Is it going to land where it's supposed to?

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:53.281
So look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you.

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.668
Now what you need to do, if you're trying to develop

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:57.125
a new treatment for autism

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.344
or Alzheimer's disease or cancer

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.136
is to find the right shape in that mix

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:04.053
that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.

00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:07.220
And when you look at what happens to that pipeline,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.721
you start out maybe with thousands,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.363
tens of thousands of compounds.

00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:12.512
You weed down through various steps

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:13.895
that cause many of these to fail.

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:17.235
Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:20.277
and if all goes well, 14 years after you started,

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:22.288
you will get one approval.

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:24.318
And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:26.462
for that one success.

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:29.766
So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:30.974
and say, "How can we do better?"

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:33.651
And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:35.464
How can we make this go faster?

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:38.529
How can we make it more successful?

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:39.870
Well, let me tell you about a few examples

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.126
where this has actually worked.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:45.077
One that has just happened in the last few months

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:48.787
is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.

00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:50.441
But it's taken a long time to get there.

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:55.043
Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:57.371
by my group working with another group in Toronto,

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.506
discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.134
on chromosome 7.

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.172
That picture you see there?

00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:05.275
Here it is. That's the same kid.

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:08.619
That's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:09.898
because this is the year,

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.336
and it's also the year where Danny got married,

00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:15.393
where we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:19.130
of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.068
based upon all this molecular understanding.

00:04:21.068 --> 00:04:22.492
That's the good news.

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:26.121
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:28.330
and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.665
for that next generation to help him.

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:33.860
But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.553
How do we go faster?

00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:38.251
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.915
and a very important technology that we depend on

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:43.211
for all of this is the human genome,

00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.799
the ability to be able to look at a chromosome,

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:48.469
to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.419
and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.500
the A's, C's, G's and T's

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.771
that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,

00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:58.285
and the cost of doing this,

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:00.940
which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.853
has in the course of the last 10 years

00:05:02.853 --> 00:05:05.252
fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point

00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:09.259
where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.058
and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.

00:05:13.058 --> 00:05:14.384
Well, that's exciting.

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:18.194
How does that play out in terms of application to a disease?

00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:20.474
I want to tell you about another disorder.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:22.786
This one is a disorder which is quite rare.

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:25.554
It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:28.859
and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:32.642
Only about one in every four million kids has this disease,

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:36.002
and in a simple way, what happens is,

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.703
because of a mutation in a particular gene,

00:05:38.703 --> 00:05:41.370
a protein is made that's toxic to the cell

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.667
and it causes these individuals to age

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.251
at about seven times the normal rate.

00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:49.394
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.

00:05:49.394 --> 00:05:52.529
The normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.418
would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,

00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:59.297
which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries

00:05:59.297 --> 00:06:01.052
and it looks kind of like that.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:02.916
A progeria cell, on the other hand,

00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:06.018
because of this toxic protein called progerin,

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:08.302
has these lumps and bumps in it.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:11.317
So what we would like to do after discovering this

00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:13.169
back in 2003

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.387
is to come up with a way to try to correct that.

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:19.475
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:21.474
it was possible to pick

00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:24.091
one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful

00:06:24.091 --> 00:06:25.552
and try it out.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.127
In an experiment done in cell culture

00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:30.169
and shown here in a cartoon,

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.863
if you take that particular compound

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:36.119
and you add it to that cell that has progeria,

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.340
and you watch to see what happened,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.302
in just 72 hours, that cell becomes,

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:43.570
for all purposes that we can determine,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.412
almost like a normal cell.

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:49.753
Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?

00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:53.138
This has led, in the space of only four years

00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:56.639
from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.836
to a test of that very compound.

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.799
And the kids that you see here

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:03.361
all volunteered to be part of this,

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:04.822
28 of them,

00:07:04.822 --> 00:07:07.917
and you can see as soon as the picture comes up

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:11.299
that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:12.718
all afflicted by this disease,

00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:14.967
all looking quite similar to each other.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.641
And instead of telling you more about it,

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:20.627
I'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,

00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.060
who's here this morning, to come up on the stage

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.280
and tell us about his experience

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.190
as a child affected with progeria.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.248
Sam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,

00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:33.369
both physicians, are here with us this morning as well.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.907
Sam, please have a seat.

00:07:35.907 --> 00:07:43.227
(Applause)

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:45.405
So Sam, why don't you tell these folks

00:07:45.405 --> 00:07:48.780
what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.588
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:56.552
I cannot play sports or do physical activities,

00:07:56.552 --> 00:07:59.756
but I have been able to take interest in things

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:02.735
that progeria, luckily, does not limit.

00:08:02.735 --> 00:08:05.292
But when there is something that I really do want to do

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:08.309
that progeria gets in the way of, like marching band

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:11.735
or umpiring, we always find a way to do it,

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:15.252
and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:16.962
(Applause)

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:18.998
Francis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.095
here in the auditorium and others listening to this?

00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:24.692
What would you say to them both about research on progeria

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:26.578
and maybe about other conditions as well?

00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:29.724
SB: Well, research on progeria has come so far

00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:31.966
in less than 15 years,

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:36.335
and that just shows the drive that researchers can have

00:08:36.335 --> 00:08:39.753
to get this far, and it really means a lot

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:43.004
to myself and other kids with progeria,

00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:45.828
and it shows that if that drive exists,

00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:48.429
anybody can cure any disease,

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:52.376
and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:56.133
and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:59.140
that Francis was talking about.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.269
FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:07.404
to be here, and he is — (Applause) --

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:12.220
He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.553
in his school in Boston.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.754
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:19.407
SB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.

00:09:19.407 --> 00:09:31.225
(Applause)

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:33.932
So I just want to say a couple more things

00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:37.064
about that particular story, and then try to generalize

00:09:37.064 --> 00:09:39.560
how could we have stories of success

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.073
all over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,

00:09:43.073 --> 00:09:45.592
these 4,000 that are waiting for answers.

00:09:45.592 --> 00:09:47.464
You might have noticed that the drug

00:09:47.464 --> 00:09:50.233
that is now in clinical trial for progeria

00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:51.997
is not a drug that was designed for that.

00:09:51.997 --> 00:09:54.859
It's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:58.589
to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:00.749
This is a drug that was developed for cancer.

00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:02.914
Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:05.237
but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:08.129
to work for progeria, and that's what's happened.

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:11.357
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?

00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:15.153
Could we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there

00:10:15.153 --> 00:10:16.991
that have drugs in their freezers

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.193
that are known to be safe in humans

00:10:19.193 --> 00:10:21.485
but have never actually succeeded in terms

00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:24.341
of being effective for the treatments they were tried for?

00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:26.725
Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways --

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:29.804
some of those could be repositioned or repurposed,

00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:32.203
or whatever word you want to use, for new applications,

00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:35.172
basically teaching old drugs new tricks.

00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:37.859
That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:40.905
We have many discussions now between NIH and companies

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:43.029
about doing this that are looking very promising.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:45.643
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.

00:10:45.643 --> 00:10:48.682
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:51.035
about how this has led to major advances.

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:53.242
The first drug for HIV/AIDS

00:10:53.242 --> 00:10:54.971
was not developed for HIV/AIDS.

00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:57.489
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.490
It didn't work very well for cancer, but became

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.606
the first successful antiretroviral,

00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:04.178
and you can see from the table there are others as well.

00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:07.822
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:10.046
Well, we have to come up with a partnership

00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:12.906
between academia, government, the private sector,

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:15.359
and patient organizations to make that so.

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:17.009
At NIH, we have started this new

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:20.209
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:23.824
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.

00:11:23.824 --> 00:11:25.265
Let me tell you another thing we could do.

00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:28.184
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:30.555
to see if it's effective and safe

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:32.656
without having to put patients at risk,

00:11:32.656 --> 00:11:35.209
because that first time you're never quite sure?

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:37.360
How do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.605
before we give them to people? We test them on animals.

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:43.247
And it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,

00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:44.937
and it's time-consuming.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:47.800
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.032
You probably know, if you've been paying attention

00:11:50.032 --> 00:11:51.332
to some of the science literature

00:11:51.332 --> 00:11:52.988
that you can now take a skin cell

00:11:52.988 --> 00:11:55.869
and encourage it to become a liver cell

00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:58.944
or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.

00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:02.096
So what if you used those cells as your test

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:05.041
for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?

00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:09.272
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip.

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:12.793
This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:15.968
and what they have done here, if we can run the little video,

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:18.104
is to take cells from an individual,

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:21.213
turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,

00:12:21.213 --> 00:12:23.018
and determine what would happen

00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:26.095
if you added to this various drug compounds

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:28.560
to see if they are toxic or safe.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.831
You can see this chip even breathes.

00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:33.448
It has an air channel. It has a blood channel.

00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:35.151
And it has cells in between

00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:37.589
that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.361
Are those cells happy or not?

00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:42.392
You can do this same kind of chip technology

00:12:42.392 --> 00:12:44.601
for kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,

00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:47.065
all the places where you want to see whether a drug

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:49.346
is going to be a problem, for the liver.

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:52.394
And ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,

00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:54.608
we could even see this moving to the point

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:58.049
where the ability to develop and test medicines

00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:01.235
will be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is

00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:04.736
the individualizing of the process of developing drugs

00:13:04.736 --> 00:13:06.984
and testing their safety.

00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:08.636
So let me sum up.

00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:10.896
We are in a remarkable moment here.

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:12.999
For me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.600
there has never been a time where there was more excitement

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.185
about the potential that lies in front of us.

00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:19.977
We have made all these discoveries

00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:22.342
pouring out of laboratories across the world.

00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:25.704
What do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:29.259
This is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:31.230
The payoff is enormous, both in terms of health

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.110
and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.411
Second, we need new kinds of partnerships

00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:38.632
between academia and government and the private sector

00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:41.979
and patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:45.559
in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:48.795
And third, and maybe most important, we need talent.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:50.936
We need the best and the brightest

00:13:50.936 --> 00:13:53.793
from many different disciplines to come and join this effort --

00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:56.239
all ages, all different groups --

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:58.326
because this is the time, folks.

00:13:58.326 --> 00:14:01.951
This is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:04.413
and we have the chance to take that

00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:06.903
and turn it into something which will, in fact,

00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:09.233
knock out disease. That's my goal.

00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:11.117
I hope that's your goal.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:13.797
I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets

00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:15.806
and the surfers and the bankers

00:14:15.806 --> 00:14:18.084
and all the other people who join this stage

00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:19.834
and think about what we're trying to do here

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:20.999
and why it matters.

00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:23.769
It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.

00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:26.887
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.

00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:28.330
Thank you all very much.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.161
(Applause)
