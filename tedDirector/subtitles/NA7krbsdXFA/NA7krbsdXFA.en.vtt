00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.643
What I'd like to do
is talk to you a little bit about fear

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.356
and the cost of fear

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.654
and the age of fear
from which we are now emerging.

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:26.047
I would like you to feel comfortable
with my doing that

00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:31.364
by letting you know that I know something
about fear and anxiety.

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:33.575
I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.083
(Laughter)

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:37.975
I could worry before I could walk.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:39.505
(Laughter)

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.971
Please, applaud that.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.383
(Applause)

00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:45.726
Thank you.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:51.639
But I also grew up in a time
where there was something to fear.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.176
We were brought out in the hall
when I was a little kid

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.650
and taught how to put
our coats over our heads

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:03.427
to protect us from global
thermonuclear war.

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:08.066
Now even my seven-year-old brain
knew that wasn't going to work.

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.337
But I also knew

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:15.085
that global thermonuclear war
was something to be concerned with.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.270
And yet, despite the fact
that we lived for 50 years

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:21.657
with the threat of such a war,

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.662
the response of our government
and of our society

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.566
was to do wonderful things.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.218
We created the space program
in response to that.

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:34.339
We built our highway system
in response to that.

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:37.910
We created the Internet
in response to that.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:42.127
So sometimes fear can produce
a constructive response.

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:46.169
But sometimes it can produce
an un-constructive response.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.975
On September 11, 2001,

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.510
19 guys took over four airplanes

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:56.822
and flew them into a couple of buildings.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.127
They exacted a horrible toll.

00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:04.151
It is not for us to minimize
what that toll was.

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:11.948
But the response that we had
was clearly disproportionate --

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:16.850
disproportionate to the point
of verging on the unhinged.

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:20.776
We rearranged the national security
apparatus of the United States

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.640
and of many governments

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:27.382
to address a threat that,
at the time that those attacks took place,

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:28.709
was quite limited.

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:32.164
In fact, according to our
intelligence services,

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:35.556
on September 11, 2001,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.809
there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:41.904
There were just a few thousand terrorists.

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:45.471
They posed an existential threat

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:46.664
to no one.

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:52.137
But we rearranged our entire
national security apparatus

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:56.242
in the most sweeping way
since the end of the Second World War.

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:58.416
We launched two wars.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.773
We spent trillions of dollars.

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:02.974
We suspended our values.

00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:04.849
We violated international law.

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.105
We embraced torture.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.802
We embraced the idea

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:10.897
that if these 19 guys could do this,
anybody could do it.

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:14.241
And therefore,
for the first time in history,

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:17.213
we were seeing everybody as a threat.

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:19.089
And what was the result of that?

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:23.121
Surveillance programs that listened in
on the emails and phone calls

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.310
of entire countries --

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:27.740
hundreds of millions of people --

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:30.787
setting aside whether
those countries were our allies,

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:33.259
setting aside what our interests were.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.013
I would argue that 15 years later,

00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:40.430
since today there are more terrorists,

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:43.996
more terrorist attacks,
more terrorist casualties --

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.360
this by the count
of the U.S. State Department --

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:50.453
since today the region
from which those attacks emanate

00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:54.166
is more unstable
than at any time in its history,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.870
since the Flood, perhaps,

00:03:57.894 --> 00:04:01.657
we have not succeeded in our response.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:04.213
Now you have to ask,
where did we go wrong?

00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:06.687
What did we do?
What was the mistake that was made?

00:04:06.711 --> 00:04:10.840
And you might say, well look,
Washington is a dysfunctional place.

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:12.558
There are political food fights.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:16.145
We've turned our discourse
into a cage match.

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.451
And that's true.

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.453
But there are bigger problems,
believe it or not, than that dysfunction,

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:23.345
even though I would argue

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:28.020
that dysfunction that makes it impossible
to get anything done

00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.725
in the richest and most powerful
country in the world

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:37.398
is far more dangerous than anything
that a group like ISIS could do,

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:41.046
because it stops us in our tracks
and it keeps us from progress.

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:43.655
But there are other problems.

00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:45.291
And the other problems

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:48.871
came from the fact that in Washington
and in many capitals right now,

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:50.686
we're in a creativity crisis.

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:53.755
In Washington, in think tanks,

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.897
where people are supposed to be
thinking of new ideas,

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.987
you don't get bold new ideas,

00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:01.878
because if you offer up a bold new idea,

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.754
not only are you attacked on Twitter,

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:07.129
but you will not get confirmed
in a government job.

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:12.382
Because we are reactive to the heightened
venom of the political debate,

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:15.516
you get governments that have
an us-versus-them mentality,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.937
tiny groups of people making decisions.

00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:21.243
When you sit in a room with a small group
of people making decisions,

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:22.426
what do you get?

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.090
You get groupthink.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:25.703
Everybody has the same worldview,

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:28.993
and any view from outside of the group
is seen as a threat.

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:30.596
That's a danger.

00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:35.519
You also have processes
that become reactive to news cycles.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:39.836
And so the parts of the U.S. government
that do foresight, that look forward,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.015
that do strategy --

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.802
the parts in other governments
that do this -- can't do it,

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:45.984
because they're reacting
to the news cycle.

00:05:46.383 --> 00:05:48.287
And so we're not looking ahead.

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.109
On 9/11, we had a crisis
because we were looking the wrong way.

00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:55.954
Today we have a crisis because,
because of 9/11,

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:58.629
we are still looking
in the wrong direction,

00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:04.501
and we know because we see
transformational trends on the horizon

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:09.377
that are far more important
than what we saw on 9/11;

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.203
far more important than the threat
posed by these terrorists;

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:16.477
far more important even
than the instability that we've got

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:20.752
in some areas of the world
that are racked by instability today.

00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:25.821
In fact, the things that we are seeing
in those parts of the world

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:28.459
may be symptoms.

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:32.361
They may be a reaction to bigger trends.

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:37.089
And if we are treating the symptom
and ignoring the bigger trend,

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:40.177
then we've got far bigger
problems to deal with.

00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:42.912
And so what are those trends?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.287
Well, to a group like you,

00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:46.802
the trends are apparent.

00:06:48.444 --> 00:06:53.699
We are living at a moment
in which the very fabric of human society

00:06:53.723 --> 00:06:55.512
is being rewoven.

00:06:57.057 --> 00:07:00.277
If you saw the cover of The Economist
a couple of days ago --

00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:03.847
it said that 80 percent
of the people on the planet,

00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.804
by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:11.417
They would have a small computer
connected to the Internet in their pocket.

00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:16.333
In most of Africa, the cell phone
penetration rate is 80 percent.

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:20.413
We passed the point last October

00:07:20.437 --> 00:07:24.408
when there were more
mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,

00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:26.548
out in the world than there were people.

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:33.062
We are within years
of a profound moment in our history,

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:38.443
when effectively every single
human being on the planet

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:43.075
is going to be part of a man-made
system for the first time,

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.140
able to touch anyone else --

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.526
touch them for good, touch them for ill.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:53.825
And the changes associated with that
are changing the very nature

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.450
of every aspect of governance
and life on the planet

00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:00.920
in ways that our leaders
ought to be thinking about,

00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:03.424
when they're thinking about
these immediate threats.

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.590
On the security side,

00:08:05.614 --> 00:08:11.118
we've come out of a Cold War in which
it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,

00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:12.676
and so we didn't,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.517
to a period that I call
Cool War, cyber war,

00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:21.592
where the costs of conflict are actually
so low, that we may never stop.

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:24.863
We may enter a period of constant warfare,

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:29.298
and we know this because
we've been in it for several years.

00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:34.873
And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines
to guide us in this regard.

00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.346
We don't have the basic ideas formulated.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.910
If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:43.049
do have the ability to respond
with a kinetic attack?

00:08:43.787 --> 00:08:44.994
We don't know.

00:08:45.573 --> 00:08:49.658
If somebody launches a cyber attack,
how do we deter them?

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:51.869
When China launched
a series of cyber attacks,

00:08:51.893 --> 00:08:53.420
what did the U.S. government do?

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:57.429
It said, we're going to indict
a few of these Chinese guys,

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.195
who are never coming to America.

00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:03.846
They're never going to be anywhere near
a law enforcement officer

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.875
who's going to take them into custody.

00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:09.142
It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent.

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:13.476
Special forces operators
out there in the field today

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.371
discover that small groups
of insurgents with cell phones

00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:23.666
have access to satellite imagery
that once only superpowers had.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.857
In fact, if you've got a cell phone,

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:29.197
you've got access to power
that a superpower didn't have,

00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.376
and would have highly
classified 10 years ago.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.291
In my cell phone,
I have an app that tells me

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:38.855
where every plane in the world is,
and its altitude, and its speed,

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.701
and what kind of aircraft it is,

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:43.641
and where it's going
and where it's landing.

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.978
They have apps that allow them to know

00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:51.221
what their adversary is about to do.

00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:53.621
They're using these tools in new ways.

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:57.759
When a cafe in Sydney
was taken over by a terrorist,

00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:00.076
he went in with a rifle...

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.343
and an iPad.

00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:04.497
And the weapon was the iPad.

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.298
Because he captured people,
he terrorized them,

00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:11.027
he pointed the iPad at them,

00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:13.723
and then he took the video
and he put it on the Internet,

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.770
and he took over the world's media.

00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:21.329
But it doesn't just affect
the security side.

00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:23.961
The relations between great powers --

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:26.350
we thought we were past the bipolar era.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.133
We thought we were in a unipolar world,

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:31.051
where all the big issues were resolved.

00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:32.792
Remember? It was the end of history.

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:35.425
But we're not.

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:39.837
We're now seeing that our
basic assumptions about the Internet --

00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.922
that it was going to connect us,
weave society together --

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.602
are not necessarily true.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:49.279
In countries like China,
you have the Great Firewall of China.

00:10:49.303 --> 00:10:52.823
You've got countries saying no,
if the Internet happens within our borders

00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:54.422
we control it within our borders.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.306
We control the content.
We are going to control our security.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.096
We are going to manage that Internet.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.933
We are going to say what can be on it.

00:11:00.957 --> 00:11:03.008
We're going to set
a different set of rules.

00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:05.129
Now you might think,
well, that's just China.

00:11:05.153 --> 00:11:06.867
But it's not just China.

00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:10.380
It's China, India, Russia.

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.808
It's Saudi Arabia,
it's Singapore, it's Brazil.

00:11:13.832 --> 00:11:18.346
After the NSA scandal, the Russians,
the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.425
they said, let's create
a new Internet backbone,

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:23.931
because we can't be dependent
on this other one.

00:11:23.955 --> 00:11:25.924
And so all of a sudden, what do you have?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.899
You have a new bipolar world

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.114
in which cyber-internationalism,

00:11:31.138 --> 00:11:32.289
our belief,

00:11:32.313 --> 00:11:35.150
is challenged by cyber-nationalism,

00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:36.439
another belief.

00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:40.764
We are seeing these changes
everywhere we look.

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:43.607
We are seeing the advent of mobile money.

00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:45.928
It's happening in the places
you wouldn't expect.

00:11:45.952 --> 00:11:48.329
It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,

00:11:48.353 --> 00:11:51.622
where millions of people who haven't
had access to financial services

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:54.141
now conduct all those
services on their phones.

00:11:54.702 --> 00:11:59.202
There are 2.5 million people
who don't have financial service access

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:01.242
that are going to get it soon.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.553
A billion of them are going
to have the ability to access it

00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:05.772
on their cell phone soon.

00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:08.649
It's not just going to give them
the ability to bank.

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:11.834
It's going to change
what monetary policy is.

00:12:11.858 --> 00:12:14.494
It's going to change what money is.

00:12:15.262 --> 00:12:17.433
Education is changing in the same way.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.891
Healthcare is changing in the same way.

00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:24.409
How government services are delivered
is changing in the same way.

00:12:25.607 --> 00:12:29.869
And yet, in Washington, we are debating

00:12:29.893 --> 00:12:35.358
whether to call the terrorist group
that has taken over Syria and Iraq

00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:39.542
ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.651
We are trying to determine

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:48.964
how much we want to give
in a negotiation with the Iranians

00:12:48.988 --> 00:12:53.787
on a nuclear deal which deals
with the technologies of 50 years ago,

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:59.169
when in fact, we know that the Iranians
right now are engaged in cyber war with us

00:12:59.193 --> 00:13:05.227
and we're ignoring it, partially
because businesses are not willing

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.369
to talk about the attacks
that are being waged on them.

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:12.208
And that gets us to another breakdown

00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.456
that's crucial,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.191
and another breakdown that couldn't be
more important to a group like this,

00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:20.867
because the growth of America
and real American national security

00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:25.332
and all of the things that drove progress
even during the Cold War,

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:30.107
was a public-private partnership
between science, technology and government

00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:33.639
that began when Thomas Jefferson
sat alone in his laboratory

00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:35.506
inventing new things.

00:13:36.528 --> 00:13:40.338
But it was the canals
and railroads and telegraph;

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.678
it was radar and the Internet.

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:45.413
It was Tang, the breakfast drink --

00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:48.314
probably not the most important
of those developments.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:51.674
But what you had was
a partnership and a dialogue,

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:53.963
and the dialogue has broken down.

00:13:53.987 --> 00:13:56.366
It's broken down because in Washington,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.156
less government is considered more.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.659
It's broken down because there is,
believe it or not,

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:02.523
in Washington, a war on science --

00:14:02.547 --> 00:14:05.586
despite the fact that
in all of human history,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.570
every time anyone has waged
a war on science,

00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:10.195
science has won.

00:14:11.463 --> 00:14:16.390
(Applause)

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:20.908
But we have a government
that doesn't want to listen,

00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:23.091
that doesn't have people
at the highest levels

00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:24.269
that understand this.

00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:25.444
In the nuclear age,

00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:28.635
when there were people
in senior national security jobs,

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.687
they were expected to speak throw-weight.

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:35.023
They were expected to know
the lingo, the vocabulary.

00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:37.846
If you went to the highest level
of the U.S. government now

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.403
and said, "Talk to me about cyber,
about neuroscience,

00:14:40.427 --> 00:14:43.567
about the things that are going
to change the world of tomorrow,"

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.742
you'd get a blank stare.

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:46.687
I know, because when I wrote this book,

00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:49.751
I talked to 150 people,
many from the science and tech side,

00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:52.831
who felt like they were being
shunted off to the kids' table.

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:55.471
Meanwhile, on the tech side,

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.300
we have lots of wonderful people
creating wonderful things,

00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:02.281
but they started in garages
and they didn't need the government

00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:03.978
and they don't want the government.

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:06.769
Many of them have a political view
that's somewhere between

00:15:06.793 --> 00:15:08.687
libertarian and anarchic:

00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:10.072
leave me alone.

00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:13.119
But the world's coming apart.

00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:17.057
All of a sudden, there are going to be
massive regulatory changes

00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:19.999
and massive issues
associated with conflict

00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:24.308
and massive issues associated
with security and privacy.

00:15:24.332 --> 00:15:26.827
And we haven't even gotten
to the next set of issues,

00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:28.815
which are philosophical issues.

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:32.423
If you can't vote,
if you can't have a job,

00:15:32.447 --> 00:15:34.939
if you can't bank,
if you can't get health care,

00:15:34.963 --> 00:15:37.405
if you can't be educated
without Internet access,

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:42.340
is Internet access a fundamental right
that should be written into constitutions?

00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:45.535
If Internet access is a fundamental right,

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:49.717
is electricity access for the 1.2 billion
who don't have access to electricity

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.158
a fundamental right?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.529
These are fundamental issues.
Where are the philosophers?

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.213
Where's the dialogue?

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.106
And that brings me
to the reason that I'm here.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:03.077
I live in Washington. Pity me.

00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:04.871
(Laughter)

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:07.162
The dialogue isn't happening there.

00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:10.327
These big issues
that will change the world,

00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:12.999
change national security,
change economics,

00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:15.906
create hope, create threats,

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.644
can only be resolved
when you bring together

00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:22.049
groups of people who understand
science and technology

00:16:22.073 --> 00:16:23.746
back together with government.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.950
Both sides need each other.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:31.238
And until we recreate that connection,

00:16:31.262 --> 00:16:36.693
until we do what helped America grow
and helped other countries grow,

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:39.787
then we are going to grow
ever more vulnerable.

00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:44.358
The risks associated with 9/11
will not be measured

00:16:44.382 --> 00:16:47.388
in terms of lives lost by terror attacks

00:16:47.412 --> 00:16:51.497
or buildings destroyed
or trillions of dollars spent.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.943
They'll be measured in terms of the costs
of our distraction from critical issues

00:16:56.967 --> 00:17:00.700
and our inability to get together

00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:04.920
scientists, technologists,
government leaders,

00:17:04.944 --> 00:17:10.079
at a moment of transformation
akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,

00:17:10.103 --> 00:17:13.821
akin to the beginning
of the major transformational eras

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:16.334
that have happened on Earth,

00:17:16.358 --> 00:17:20.804
and start coming up with,
if not the right answers,

00:17:20.828 --> 00:17:23.181
then at least the right questions.

00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:25.248
We are not there yet,

00:17:25.272 --> 00:17:28.336
but discussions like this
and groups like you

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.146
are the places where those questions
can be formulated and posed.

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:37.107
And that's why I believe
that groups like TED,

00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:39.724
discussions like this around the planet,

00:17:39.748 --> 00:17:44.458
are the place where the future
of foreign policy, of economic policy,

00:17:44.482 --> 00:17:49.969
of social policy, of philosophy,
will ultimately take place.

00:17:50.394 --> 00:17:52.824
And that's why it's been
a pleasure speaking to you.

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:54.103
Thank you very, very much.

00:17:54.127 --> 00:17:58.993
(Applause)
