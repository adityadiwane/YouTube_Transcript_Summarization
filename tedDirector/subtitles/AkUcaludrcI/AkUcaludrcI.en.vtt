00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.236
Every summer, my family and I
travel across the world,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.116
3,000 miles away

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740
to the culturally diverse
country of India.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.940
Now, India is a country infamous
for its scorching heat and humidity.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.020
For me, the only relief from this heat
is to drink plenty of water.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.236
Now, while in India,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.740
my parents always remind me
to only drink boiled or bottled water,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.476
because unlike here in America,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.700
where I can just turn on a tap
and easily get clean, potable water,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.820
in India, the water is often contaminated.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.156
So my parents have to make sure

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.140
that the water we drink is safe.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.676
However, I soon realized

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.356
that not everyone is fortunate enough

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.820
to enjoy the clean water we did.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.196
Outside my grandparents' house
in the busy streets of India,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.876
I saw people standing in long lines

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.596
under the hot sun

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.900
filling buckets with water from a tap.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.156
I even saw children,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.836
who looked the same age as me,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.236
filling up these clear plastic bottles

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.340
with dirty water
from streams on the roadside.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.396
Watching these kids

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.556
forced to drink water

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.596
that I felt was too dirty to touch

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.780
changed my perspective on the world.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.396
This unacceptable social injustice

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.476
compelled me to want to find a solution

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.460
to our world's clean water problem.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.916
I wanted to know
why these kids lacked water,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.380
a substance that is essential for life.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.076
And I learned that we are facing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.460
a global water crisis.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.356
Now, this may seem surprising,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.476
as 75 percent of our planet
is covered in water,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.556
but only 2.5 percent
of that is freshwater,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.516
and less than one percent
of Earth's freshwater supply

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.500
is available for human consumption.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.276
With rising populations,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.275
industrial development
and economic growth,

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.076
our demand for clean water is increasing,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300
yet our freshwater resources
are rapidly depleting.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.276
According to the
World Health Organization,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.196
660 million people in our world

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.820
lack access to a clean water source.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.076
Lack of access to clean water
is a leading cause of death

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.116
in children under the age of five
in developing countries,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.596
and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.340
die every day from
a water-related disease.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.476
So after returning home
one summer in eighth grade,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.596
I decided that I wanted
to combine my passion

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.756
for solving the global water crisis

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780
with my interest in science.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.396
So I decided that the best thing to do

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.340
would be to convert my garage
into a laboratory.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.956
(Laughter)

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.836
Actually, at first I converted
my kitchen into a laboratory,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.700
but my parents didn't really approve
and kicked me out.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.676
I also read a lot of journal papers
on water-related research,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.556
and I learned that currently
in developing countries,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.996
something called solar disinfection,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.980
or SODIS, is used to purify water.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.636
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles
are filled with contaminated water

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.580
and then exposed to sunlight
for six to eight hours.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.356
The UV radiation from the sun

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.836
destroys the DNA
of these harmful pathogens

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.820
and decontaminates the water.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.436
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use
and energy-efficient,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.756
as it only uses solar energy,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.156
it's really slow,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.940
as it can take up to two days
when it's cloudy.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.876
So in order to make
the SODIS process faster,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.196
this new method called photocatalysis

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.860
has recently been used.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.316
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.556
Let's break it down:

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.236
"photo" means from the sun,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.300
and a catalyst is something
that speeds up a reaction.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.036
So what photocatalysis is doing

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.220
is it's just speeding up
this solar disinfection process.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.556
When sunlight comes in
and strikes a photocatalyst,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.196
like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.636
it creates these
really reactive oxygen species,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.940
like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.636
These reactive oxygen species

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.556
are able to remove bacteria and organics

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.540
and a whole lot of contaminants
from drinking water.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.956
But unfortunately,
there are several disadvantages

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.860
to the way photocatalytic SODIS
is currently deployed.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.596
See, what they do is they take
the clear plastic bottles

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.060
and they coat the inside
with this photocatalytic coating.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.316
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.036
are actually commonly used in sunscreens

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.700
to block UV radiation.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.996
So when they're coated
on the inside of these bottles,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.796
they're actually blocking
some of the UV radiation

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.380
and diminishing the efficiency
of the process.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.516
Also, these photocatalytic coatings

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.396
are not tightly bound
to the plastic bottle,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.340
which means they wash off,
and people end up drinking the catalyst.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.996
While TiO2 is safe and inert,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.756
it's really inefficient
if you keep drinking the catalyst,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.156
because then you have
to continue to replenish it,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.660
even after a few uses.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.516
So my goal was
to overcome the disadvantages

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.556
of these current treatment methods

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.836
and create a safe, sustainable,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.780
cost-effective and eco-friendly
method of purifying water.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.996
What started off as an eighth grade
science fair project

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.420
is now my photocatalytic composite
for water purification.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.900
The composite combines
titanium dioxide with cement.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.636
The cement-like composite can be formed
into several different shapes,

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.340
which results in an extremely
versatile range of deployment methods.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.036
For example, you could create a rod

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.740
that can easily be placed
inside water bottles for individual use

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.900
or you could create a porous filter
that can filter water for families.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.036
You can even coat the inside
of an existing water tank

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.916
to purify larger amounts of water

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.900
for communities
over a longer period of time.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.396
Now, over the course of this,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.876
my journey hasn't really been easy.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.276
You know, I didn't have access
to a sophisticated laboratory.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.796
I was 14 years old when I started,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.156
but I didn't let my age deter me

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.036
in my interest
in pursuing scientific research

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.540
and wanting to solve
the global water crisis.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.436
See, water isn't
just the universal solvent.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.260
Water is a universal human right.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.236
And for that reason,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.436
I'm continuing to work
on this science fair project from 2012

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.636
to bring it from the laboratory
into the real world.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.116
And this summer,
I founded Catalyst for World Water,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.420
a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing
solutions to the global water crisis.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.980
(Applause)

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.036
Alone, a single drop of water
can't do much,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.476
but when many drops come together,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.980
they can sustain life on our planet.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.436
Just as water drops
come together to form oceans,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.996
I believe that we all must come together

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.140
when tackling this global problem.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.116
Thank you.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.140
(Applause)

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.996
Thank you.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.518
(Applause)
