00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want you now to imagine

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a wearable robot

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
that gives you superhuman abilities,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
or another one that takes wheelchair users

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
up standing and walking again.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
We at Berkeley Bionics

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
call these robots exoskeletons.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
These are nothing else

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
than something that you put on in the morning,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and it will give you extra strength,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and it will further enhance your speed,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.260
It is actually the true integration

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
of the man and the machine.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
But not only that --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
it will integrate and network you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to the universe

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
and other devices out there.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
This is just not some blue sky thinking.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
To show you now what we are working on

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
by starting out talking about

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
the American soldier,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and they are being asked to carry more equipment.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
Obviously, this is resulting

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
in some major complications --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
back injuries, 30 percent of them --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
chronic back injuries.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So we thought we would look at this challenge

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and create an exoskeleton

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that would help deal with this issue.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So let me now introduce to you HULC --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
or the Human Universal

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Load Carrier.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
for many hours.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Its flexible design allows for deep squats,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
crawls and high-agility movements.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and then augments my strength and endurance.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
to introduce this device,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
this new exoskeleton this year.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
So this is for real.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Now let's turn our heads

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
towards the wheelchair users,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
something that I'm particularly passionate about.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
There are 68 million people

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This is about one percent of the total population.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And that's actually a conservative estimate.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
We are talking here about, oftentimes,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
hit a wall

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and the wheelchair's the only option.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
But it is also the aging population

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that is multiplying in numbers.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And the only option, pretty much --

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
when it's stroke or other complications --

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
is the wheelchair.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And that is actually for the last 500 years,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
since its very successful introduction, I must say.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So we thought we would start

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
writing a brand new chapter

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
of mobility.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that is worn by Amanda Boxtel

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and as a result of that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
she has not been able to walk

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
for 19 years until now.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
(Applause)

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
(Applause)

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.260
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
It has sensors.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It's completely non-invasive,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
sensors in the crutches

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that send signals back to our onboard computer

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that is sitting here at her back.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
There are battery packs here as well

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
that power motors that are sitting at her hips,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
as well as her knee joints,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that move her forward

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
AB: I was 24 years old

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and at the top of my game

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
when a freak summersault while downhill skiing

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
paralyzed me.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
In a split second,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
I lost all sensation and movement

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
below my pelvis.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Not long afterwards,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
a doctor strode into my hospital room,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and he said, "Amanda,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.260
you'll never walk again."

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And that was 19 yeas ago.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
He robbed

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
every ounce of hope

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
from my being.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Adaptive technology

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
has since enabled me

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
to learn how to downhill ski again,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
to rock climb and even handcycle.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But nothing has been invented

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that enables me to walk,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
until now.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Applause)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Thank you.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.260
(Applause)

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
EB: As you can see,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
we have the technology,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
we have the platforms

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
to sit down and have discussions with you.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
It's in our hands,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and we have all the potential here

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
to change the lives

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
of future generations --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260
not only for the soldiers,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.260
or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
but for everyone.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
AB: Thanks.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:17.260
(Applause)
