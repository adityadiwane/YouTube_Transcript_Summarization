00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.396
When someone mentions Cuba,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.620
what do you think about?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.076
Classic, classic cars?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.420
Perhaps good cigars?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.516
Maybe you think
of a famous baseball player.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.876
What about when somebody
mentions North Korea?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.995
You think about those missile tests,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.916
maybe their notorious leader

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.940
or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.956
(Laughter)

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.316
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.100
is a vision of a country,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.036
an open economy,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.579
whose citizens have access to a wide range
of affordable consumer products.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.676
I'm not here to argue how these countries
got to where they are today.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.396
I simply want to use them
as an example of countries and citizens

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.636
who have been affected,
negatively affected,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.940
by a trade policy that restricts imports

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.300
and protects local industries.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.196
Recently we've heard a number of countries

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.396
talk about restricting imports

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.436
and protecting their local,
domestic industries.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.716
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.980
but what it really is is protectionism.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.740
We heard a lot about this
during the 2016 presidential election.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.876
We heard about it
during the Brexit debates

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.220
and most recently
during the French elections.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.236
In fact, it's been
a really important topic

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.396
being talked about around the world,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.836
and many aspiring political leaders

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.420
are running on platforms
positioning protectionism as a good thing.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.396
Now, I could see why they think
protectionism is good,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.540
because sometimes
it seems like trade is unfair.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.876
Some have blamed trade

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.036
for some of the problems
we've been having here at home in the US.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.436
For years we've been hearing

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.660
about the loss of high-paying
US manufacturing jobs.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.956
Many think that manufacturing
is declining in the US

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.116
because companies are moving
their operations offshore

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.556
to markets with lower-cost labor

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.140
like China, Mexico and Vietnam.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.196
They also think trade agreements
sometimes are unfair,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.916
like NAFTA

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.756
and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.236
because these trade agreements
allow companies

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.500
to reimport those cheaply
produced goods back into the US

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.676
and other countries
from where the jobs were taken.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.796
So it kind of feels like the exporters win

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820
and the importers lose.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.996
Now, the reality is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.940
output in the manufacturing
sector in the US

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.636
is actually growing,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.236
but we are losing jobs.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.500
We're losing lots of them.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.916
In fact, from 2000 to 2010,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.580
5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.940
But they're not being lost
for the reasons you might think.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.780
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.876
didn't lose his jobs at the factory

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.356
to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.596
No.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.900
Mike lost his job to a machine.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.716
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.556
have been eliminated
because we've made improvements

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.140
in our own productivity
through automation.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.236
So that means that one out of 10
lost manufacturing jobs

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.540
was due to offshoring.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.916
Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.156
No.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.516
In fact, automation is spreading
to every production line

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.460
in every country around the world.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.156
But look, I get it:

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.676
if you just lost your job

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.356
and then you read in the newspaper

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.996
that your old company
just struck up a deal with China,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.476
it's easy to think you were just replaced

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.700
in a one-for-one deal.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.876
When I hear stories like this,
I think that what people picture

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.180
is that trade happens
between only two countries.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.356
Manufacturers in one country

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.316
produce products and they export them

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.980
to consumers in other countries,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.836
and it feels like
the manufacturing countries win

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.420
and the importing countries lose.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.860
Well, reality's a little bit different.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.796
I'm a supply chain professional,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.580
and I live and work in Mexico.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.596
And I work in the middle

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.796
of a highly connected network
of manufacturers

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.956
all collaborating from around the world

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.380
to produce many
of the products we use today.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.636
What I see

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.236
from my front-row seat in Mexico City

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.580
actually looks more like this.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.580
And this is a more accurate depiction
of what trade really looks like.

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:48.436
I've had the pleasure of being able to see

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.956
how many different products
are manufactured,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.796
from golf clubs to laptop computers

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.396
to internet servers, automobiles

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.620
and even airplanes.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.100
And believe me, none of it
happens in a straight line.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.546
Let me give you an example.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.596
A few months ago, I was touring
the manufacturing plant

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.596
of a multinational aerospace company

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.900
in QuerÃ©taro, Mexico,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.300
and the VP of logistics points out
a completed tail assembly.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.636
It turns out the tail assemblies
are assembled from panels

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.156
that are manufactured in France,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.396
and they're assembled in Mexico

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.340
using components imported from the US.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.876
When those tail assemblies are done,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.356
they're exported via truck to Canada

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.556
to their primary assembly plant

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.836
where they come together

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.276
with thousands of other parts,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.676
like the wings and the seats

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.596
and the little shades
over the little windows,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.020
all coming in to become
a part of a new airplane.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.500
Think about it.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.596
These new airplanes,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.196
before they even take their first flight,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.676
they have more stamps in their passports

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.940
than Angelina Jolie.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.076
Now, this approach to processing
goes on all around the world

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.596
to manufacture many of the products

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.156
we use every day,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.500
from skin cream to airplanes.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.780
When you go home tonight,
take a look in your house.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.700
You might be surprised to find
a label that looks like this one:

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.100
"Manufactured in the USA
from US and foreign parts."

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.156
Economist Michael Porter

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.140
described what's going on here best.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.396
Many decades ago, he said
that it's most beneficial for a country

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.796
to focus on producing the products
it can produce most efficiently

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.580
and trading for the rest.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.580
So what he's talking about here
is shared production,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.220
and efficiency is the name of the game.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.076
You've probably seen an example of this

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.460
at home or at work.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.356
Let's take a look at an example.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.500
Think about how your house was built

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.740
or your kitchen renovated.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.876
Typically, there's a general contractor

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.116
who is responsible
for coordinating the efforts

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.756
of all the different contractors:

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.420
an architect to draw the plans,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.236
an earth-moving company
to dig the foundation,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.140
a plumber, a carpenter and so on.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.676
So why doesn't the general contractor

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.316
pick just one company

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.556
to do all the work,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.780
like, say, the architect?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.620
Because this is silly.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.876
The general contractor selects experts

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.636
because it takes years

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.396
to learn and master

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.196
how to do each of the tasks it takes
to build a house or renovate a kitchen,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.500
some of them requiring special training.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.076
Think about it:

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.540
Would you want your architect
to install your toilet?

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.556
Of course not.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.420
So let's apply this process
to the corporate world.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.596
Companies today focus on manufacturing

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.956
what they produce best
and most efficiently,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.820
and they trade for everything else.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.196
So this means they rely

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.196
on a global, interconnected,
interdependent network of manufacturers

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.476
to produce these products.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.556
In fact, that network is so interconnected

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.820
it's almost impossible

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.260
to dismantle and produce
products in just one country.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.236
Let's take a look
at the interconnected web

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.916
we saw a few moments ago,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.236
and let's focus on just one strand

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.340
between the US and Mexico.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.276
The Wilson Institute says
that shared production represents

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.380
40 percent of the half a trillion dollars
in trade between the US and Mexico.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.556
That's about 200 billion dollars,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.540
or the same as the GDP for Portugal.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.076
So let's just imagine

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.196
that the US decides to impose

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.940
a 20 percent border tax
on all imports from Mexico.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.876
OK, fine.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.260
But do you think Mexico is just
going to stand by and let that happen?

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.636
No. No way.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.716
So in retaliation,
they impose a similar tax

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.580
on all goods being imported from the US,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.700
and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.476
and 20 percent -- just imagine
that 20 percent duties

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.996
are added to every good,
product, product component

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.716
crossing back and forth across the border,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.076
and you could be looking at more
than a 40 percent increase in duties,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.860
or 80 billion dollars.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.396
Now, don't kid yourself,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.716
these costs are going to be passed along

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.980
to you and to me.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.036
Now, let's think about what impact
that might have on some of the products,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.780
or the prices of the products,
that we buy every day.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.836
So if a 30 percent increase in duties
were actually passed along,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.500
we would be looking at some
pretty important increases in prices.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.260
A Lincoln MKZ would go
from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.940
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.836
would go from 898 dollars
to 1,167 dollars.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.996
And the price of a 16-ounce jar
of CVS skin moisturizer

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.460
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.436
Now, remember, this is only looking
at one strand of the production chain

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.836
between the US and Mexico,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.660
so multiply this out
across all of the strands.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.076
The impact could be considerable.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.756
Now, just think about this:

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.020
even if we were able
to dismantle this network

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.516
and produce products in just one country,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.036
which by the way is easier said than done,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.476
we would still only
be saving or protecting

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.396
one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.460
That's right, because remember,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.876
most of those jobs, 87 percent,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.580
were lost due to improvements
in our own productivity.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.500
And unfortunately,
those jobs, they're gone for good.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.540
So the real question is,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.676
does it make sense for us
to drive up prices

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.220
to the point where many of us can't afford
the basic goods we use every day

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.316
for the purpose of saving a job

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.820
that might be eliminated
in a couple of years anyway?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.876
The reality is that shared production

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.556
allows us to manufacture
higher quality products

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.796
at lower costs.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.020
It's that simple.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.636
It allows us to get more

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.076
out of the limited resources
and expertise we have

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.300
and at the same time
benefit from lower prices.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.436
It's really important to remember

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.276
that for shared production
to be effective,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.716
it relies on efficient cross-border
movement of raw materials,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.700
components and finished products.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.980
So remember this:

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.996
the next time you're hearing somebody
try to sell you on the idea

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.340
that protectionism is a good deal,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.836
it's just not.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.076
Thank you.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.860
(Applause)
