00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.160
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
So he starts out with one line, and then two,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and then four, and then 16, and so on.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
he ends up with an infinite number of lines,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
each of which has an infinite number of points in it.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
And when he came out of the sanitarium,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.160
he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
He was a very religious man.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
He was a mathematician on a mission.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.160
we can use any seed shape we like.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK --

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So these all have the property of self-similarity:

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
the part looks like the whole.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
It's the same pattern at many different scales.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.160
because as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
This made no sense at all,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160
(Laughter)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And that worked for a hundred years.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.160
realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
you get the shapes of nature.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
you get these beautiful natural forms.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet --

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
go ahead and do that now --

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
Your body is covered with fractals.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
So nature has this self-similar structure.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
Nature uses self-organizing systems.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
asking people why they were building fractals,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
which is a great job if you can get it.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160
(Laughter)

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
just to see how it would sort of unfold --

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
and my French is not very good; I said something like,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and we talked about fractals.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
we know all about that."

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
This is a village in southern Zambia.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.160
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
You have a huge ring.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.160
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160
So here's a little fractal model for it.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Here's one house with the sacred altar,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and then here's the village as a whole --

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
and here there's a tiny village only this big.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
Now you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.160
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.160
So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
I came up with this structure here.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.160
Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Now, after I did the simulation,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.160
and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
So, when I got to the village,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
I said, "Can you take me to the square building?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
I think something's going on there."

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields."

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
So here's a Nankani village in Mali.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
and they're stacked recursively.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Now, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And when she dies, they have a ceremony

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.160
where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Once again, infinity is important.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
And that was actually my original hypothesis.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
When I first saw those African fractals,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
I thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
But that turns out not to be true.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160
I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
only the African ones were fractal.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.160
And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.160
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
You can see on the pottery and the baskets.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.160
Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
you can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160
It is not the same pattern at two different scales.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160
Second, you might ask,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.160
"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And three times, the answer is no.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
First of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
and then oppositional movements.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.160
No, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture --

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
and it definitely is not "in the DNA."

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity --

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other --

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
you see very different uses for fractals.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
It's a shared technology in Africa.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
It's not really mathematical knowledge.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.160
Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
So some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
asking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160
and they'd say,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.160
"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
But sometimes, that's not the case.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160
In some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
we now call it an Eulerian path --

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
you can never lift your stylus from the surface

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
and you can never go over the same line twice.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
And with each iteration of that algorithm,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
you learn the iterations of the myth.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
You learn the next level of knowledge.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160
it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
Well, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and would use them strategically.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
So this is very conscious knowledge.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Here's a wonderful fractal.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
And his answer was very interesting.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.160
He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
because they're very quick and they're very cheap.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
It doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw."

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
He said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.160
Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.160
But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
"Now," he said, "we know from experience

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.160
that the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And I measured out the lengths of straw,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160
and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
in the wind engineering handbook.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.160
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.160
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
and this was Bamana sand divination.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
and often the symbols are very well preserved,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:17.160
so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.160
you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
And they did this very rapidly,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
and I couldn't understand where they were getting --

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
they only did the randomness four times --

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
And they wouldn't tell me.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
They said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
and I'll come each day and pay you."

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
They said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160
And finally, out of desperation, I said,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160
And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And of course, I was only interested in the math,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160
"You know, I didn't learn it this way."

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.160
and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.160
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.160
When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
So even plus odd gives you odd.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Odd plus even gives you odd.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.160
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
Now, because it's a binary code,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
you can actually implement this in hardware --

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.160
what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:11.160
In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
divination through the earth.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
Leibniz, the German mathematician,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.160
let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
So all these little PDAs and laptops --

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.160
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.160
but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.160
So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
And you can go to our website,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
the applets are all free; they just run in the browser.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
Anybody in the world can use them.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.160
The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:28.160
recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
so hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.160
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.160
We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
in comparison with a control group that did not have the software.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.160
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.160
that it's not just about singing and dancing.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.160
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
We've also been working in design.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.160
I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.160
for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
it doesn't quite fit.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:39.160
David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
in which he's used some of these fractal structures.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.160
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.160
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Actually, the reason that Google was such a success

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.160
It's in ecological sustainability.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
the ethical power of democracy.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
It's also in some bad things.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.160
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
you haven't opened your eyes enough.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
the traditional African methods for doing self-organization.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
These are robust algorithms.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship --

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.160
that are gentle, that are egalitarian.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.160
So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.160
we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160
Thank you.
