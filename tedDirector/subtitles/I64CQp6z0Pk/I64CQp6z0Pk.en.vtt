00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.391
So, I have a feature on my website where every week

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.391
people submit hypothetical questions

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:18.979
for me to answer,

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:21.360
and I try to answer them using math, science

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.820
and comics.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.228
So for example, one person asked,

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:26.922
what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.328
pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:32.280
So I did some calculations.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.547
Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:36.021
the air will flow around the object,

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:37.950
but in this case, the ball would be going so fast

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.401
that the air molecules wouldn't have time

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.020
to move out of the way.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.007
The ball would smash right into and through them,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:45.668
and the collisions with these air molecules

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:47.333
would knock away the nitrogen,

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.291
carbon and hydrogen from the ball,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.128
fragmenting it off into tiny particles,

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:53.612
and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.140
in the air around it.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.305
This would result in a flood of x-rays

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.056
that would spread out in a bubble

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.482
along with exotic particles,

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:03.602
plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:07.144
and that would move away from the pitcher's mound

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.629
slightly faster than the ball.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:12.311
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.214
the home plate is far enough away

00:01:14.214 --> 00:01:16.120
that light hasn't had time to reach it,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.571
which means the batter

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.335
still sees the pitcher about to throw

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:22.352
and has no idea that anything is wrong.

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.624
(Laughter)

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:27.050
Now, after 70 nanoseconds,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.504
the ball will reach home plate,

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:31.241
or at least the cloud of expanding plasma

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.370
that used to be the ball,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.135
and it will engulf the bat and the batter

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:40.596
and the plate and the catcher and the umpire

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.401
and start disintegrating them all

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.567
as it also starts to carry them backward

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:50.031
through the backstop, which
also starts to disintegrate.

00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.801
So if you were watching this whole thing

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:53.108
from a hill,

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:56.481
ideally, far away,

00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:57.936
what you'd see is a bright flash of light

00:01:57.936 --> 00:01:59.442
that would fade over a few seconds,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.570
followed by a blast wave spreading out,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.030
shredding trees and houses

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.149
as it moves away from the stadium,

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.081
and then eventually a mushroom cloud

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:12.842
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:13.998
So the Major League Baseball rules

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:16.102
are a little bit hazy,

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:20.987
but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,

00:02:20.987 --> 00:02:22.596
I think that in this situation,

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.049
the batter would be considered hit by pitch

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.683
and would be eligible to take first base,

00:02:27.683 --> 00:02:30.886
if it still existed.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.682
So this is the kind of question I answer,

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:34.821
and I get people writing in with

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.695
a lot of other strange questions.

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:39.242
I've had someone write and say,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.161
scientifically speaking, what is the best

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.231
and fastest way to hide a body?

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.453
Can you do this one soon?

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:47.313
And I had someone write in,

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:49.328
I've had people write in about,

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.532
can you prove whether or not you can find love again

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:53.204
after your heart's broken?

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:54.979
And I've had people send in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.970
what are clearly homework questions

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.113
they're trying to get me to do for them.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.018
But one week, a couple months ago,

00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:06.679
I got a question that was actually about Google.

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.645
If all digital data in the world
were stored on punch cards,

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:12.324
how big would Google's data warehouse be?

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.046
Now, Google's pretty secretive
about their operations,

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:18.422
so no one really knows how much data Google has,

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:20.937
and in fact, no one really knows
how many data centers Google has,

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:23.428
except people at Google itself.

00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:24.662
And I've tried, I've met them a few times,

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:29.885
tried asking them, and they
aren't revealing anything.

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:32.420
So I decided to try to figure this out myself.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.579
There are a few things that I looked at here.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.485
I started with money.

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:38.627
Google has to reveal how much they spend,

00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:40.617
in general, and that lets you put some caps

00:03:40.617 --> 00:03:44.403
on how many data centers could they be building,

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:46.703
because a big data center costs
a certain amount of money.

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:49.135
And you can also then put a cap on

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:51.466
how much of the world hard
drive market are they taking up,

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.418
which turns out, it's pretty sizable.

00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:55.355
I read a calculation at one point,

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:56.820
I think Google has a drive failure

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.074
about every minute or two,

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:01.424
and they just throw out the hard drive

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:02.810
and swap in a new one.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.010
So they go through a huge number of them.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.121
And so by looking at money,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.970
you can get an idea of how
many of these centers they have.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.830
You can also look at power.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.727
You can look at how much electricity they need,

00:04:14.727 --> 00:04:16.534
because you need a certain amount
of electricity to run the servers,

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:18.573
and Google is more efficient than most,

00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:21.670
but they still have some basic requirements,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.586
and that lets you put a limit

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:25.533
on the number of servers that they have.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:29.724
You can also look at square footage and see

00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:31.000
of the data centers that you know,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.353
how big are they?

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:33.275
How much room is that?

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.635
How many server racks could you fit in there?

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.338
And for some data centers,

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:39.327
you might get two of these pieces of information.

00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:41.023
You know how much they spent,

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:43.380
and they also, say, because they had to contract

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.799
with the local government

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:46.479
to get the power provided,

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.136
you might know what they made a deal to buy,

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:50.890
so you know how much power it takes.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.184
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:54.713
and figure out for a data center

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:56.349
where you don't have that information,

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.441
you can figure out,

00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:59.628
but maybe you only have one of those,

00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:01.307
you know the square footage,
then you could figure out

00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:03.630
well, maybe the power is proportional.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.950
And you can do this same thing
with a lot of different quantities,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.026
you know, with guesses about
the total amount of storage,

00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:10.619
the number of servers, the
number of drives per server,

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.666
and in each case using what you know

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.193
to come up with a model that narrows down

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.323
your guesses for the things that you don't know.

00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:20.588
It's sort of circling around the
number you're trying to get.

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:23.143
And this is a lot of fun.

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:25.325
The math is not all that advanced,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.460
and really it's like nothing more than

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.472
solving a sudoku puzzle.

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:35.781
So what I did, I went through all of this information,

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:37.540
spent a day or two researching.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.579
And there are some things I didn't look at.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:42.622
You could always look at the Google

00:05:42.622 --> 00:05:44.439
recruitment messages that they post.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.377
That gives you an idea of where they have people.

00:05:46.377 --> 00:05:47.988
Sometimes, when people visit a data center,

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:49.833
they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.323
and they aren't supposed to,

00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:54.136
but you can learn things about
their hardware that way.

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:56.689
And in fact, you can just
look at pizza delivery drivers.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.344
Turns out, they know where all
the Google data centers are,

00:05:59.344 --> 00:06:02.220
at least the ones that have people in them.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.405
But I came up with my estimate,

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:06.269
which I felt pretty good about,

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:09.518
that was about 10 exabytes of data

00:06:09.518 --> 00:06:11.940
across all of Google's operations,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.372
and then another maybe five exabytes or so

00:06:15.372 --> 00:06:17.417
of offline storage in tape drives,

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:18.992
which it turns out Google is

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:21.502
about the world's largest consumer of.

00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:25.063
So I came up with this estimate, and this is

00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:26.306
a staggering amount of data.

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:29.180
It's quite a bit more than any other organization

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.927
in the world has, as far as we know.

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:32.673
There's a couple of other contenders,

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:35.017
especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.

00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:36.446
But using some of these same methods,

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.469
we can look at the NSA's data centers,

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.951
and figure out, you know, we
don't know what's going on there,

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:43.041
but it's pretty clear that their operation

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.638
is not the size of Google's.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.377
Adding all of this up, I came up with

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:48.273
the other thing that we can answer, which is,

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:50.258
how many punch cards would this take?

00:06:50.258 --> 00:06:53.216
And so a punch card can hold

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.207
about 80 characters,

00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:58.980
and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.254
and you put them in, say,

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.206
my home region of New England,

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:04.546
it would cover the entire region

00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:08.020
up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.463
which is about three times deeper

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.862
than the glaciers during the last ice age

00:07:11.862 --> 00:07:14.030
about 20,000 years ago.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.453
So this is impractical, but I think

00:07:16.453 --> 00:07:19.404
that's about the best answer I could come up with.

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.542
And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:25.232
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,

00:07:25.232 --> 00:07:26.863
because of course they've been so secretive,

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.267
they didn't answer of my questions,

00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:29.774
and so I just put it up and said,

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:31.297
well, I guess we'll never know.

00:07:31.297 --> 00:07:33.321
But then a little while later

00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:35.770
I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.212
saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:42.013
So I go and get it, open it up,

00:07:42.013 --> 00:07:44.540
and it's punch cards. (Laughter)

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.622
Google-branded punch cards.

00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:50.870
And on these punch cards,
there are a bunch of holes,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.171
and I said, thank you, thank you,

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.690
okay, so what's on here?

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.320
So I get some software and start reading it,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.320
and scan them, and it turns out

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.689
it's a puzzle.

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:00.327
There's a bunch of code,

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:01.581
and I get some friends to help,

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:04.133
and we crack the code, and then
inside that is another code,

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:05.428
and then there are some equations,

00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:06.599
and then we solve those equations,

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:10.070
and then finally out pops a message from Google

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.259
which is their official answer to my article,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.711
and it said, "No comment."

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:21.885
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:29.509
And I love calculating these kinds of things,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.224
and it's not that I love doing the math.

00:08:31.224 --> 00:08:32.789
I do a lot of math,

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.865
but I don't really like math for its own sake.

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:37.815
What I love is that it lets you take

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:39.215
some things that you know,

00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:43.993
and just by moving symbols
around on a piece of paper,

00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:45.690
find out something that you didn't know

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.870
that's very surprising.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.546
And I have a lot of stupid questions,

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.349
and I love that math gives the power

00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:54.106
to answer them sometimes.

00:08:54.106 --> 00:08:55.633
And sometimes not.

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:58.557
This is a question I got from a reader,

00:08:58.557 --> 00:08:59.730
an anonymous reader,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.775
and the subject line just said, "Urgent,"

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.704
and this was the entire email:

00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:06.466
"If people had wheels and could fly,

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:09.162
how would we differentiate them from airplanes?"

00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:11.837
Urgent. (Laughter)

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:15.190
And I think there are some questions

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.860
that math just cannot answer.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.331
Thank you.

00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:24.681
(Applause)
