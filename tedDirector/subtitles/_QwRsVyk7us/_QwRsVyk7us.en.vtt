00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.158
I have a friend in Portugal

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:20.582
whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:23.734
and a washing machine so he could transport his family.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.278
He did it because he couldn't afford a car,

00:00:26.278 --> 00:00:29.182
but also because he knew how to build one.

00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:32.318
There was a time when we understood how things worked

00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:36.150
and how they were made, so we could build and repair them,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.277
or at the very least

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:40.757
make informed decisions about what to buy.

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:43.149
Many of these do-it-yourself practices

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.358
were lost in the second half of the 20th century.

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.030
But now, the maker community and the open-source model

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.178
are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:56.373
and what they're made of back into our lives,

00:00:56.373 --> 00:00:59.397
and I believe we need to take them to the next level,

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:02.365
to the components things are made of.

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:04.517
For the most part, we still know

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:08.039
what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.068
and how they are produced.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:14.131
But now we have these amazing, futuristic composites --

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.334
plastics that change shape,

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.686
paints that conduct electricity,

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:23.102
pigments that change color, fabrics that light up.

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:26.473
Let me show you some examples.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.145
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.088
instead of using the traditional

00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.686
printed circuit boards or wires.

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:40.075
In the case of this little example I'm holding,

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:43.956
we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:46.671
by turning on this little light.

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.766
Conductive ink has been used by artists,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.141
but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:57.636
to use it in laser printers and pens.

00:01:57.636 --> 00:01:59.966
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.762
with colorless light-diffusing particles.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:05.379
What this means is that, while regular acrylic

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.727
only diffuses light around the edges,

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.997
this one illuminates across the entire surface

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.910
when I turn on the lights around it.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.212
Two of the known applications for this material

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:21.325
include interior design and multi-touch systems.

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:23.326
And thermochromic pigments

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:25.939
change color at a given temperature.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.725
So I'm going to place this on a hot plate

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:32.230
that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.076
and you can see what happens.

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.836
So one of the principle applications for this material

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:44.078
is, amongst other things, in baby bottles,

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:49.432
so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:52.188
So these are just a few of what are commonly known

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.097
as smart materials.

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:57.037
In a few years, they will be in many of the objects

00:02:57.037 --> 00:03:00.396
and technologies we use on a daily basis.

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:04.610
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.979
but we can have walls that change color

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.741
depending on temperature,

00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.635
keyboards that roll up,

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:15.067
and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:17.572
So I'm a social scientist by training,

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:21.429
so why am I here today talking about smart materials?

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.142
Well first of all, because I am a maker.

00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:26.548
I'm curious about how things work

00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:28.175
and how they are made,

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.483
but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:34.304
of the components that make up our world,

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:36.784
and right now, we don't know enough about

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.473
these high-tech composites our future will be made of.

00:03:40.473 --> 00:03:43.998
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.

00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:48.038
There's barely any information available on how to use them,

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:51.935
and very little is said about how they are produced.

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:54.602
So for now, they exist mostly in this realm

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:57.314
of trade secrets and patents

00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:01.426
only universities and corporations have access to.

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.275
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:07.492
started a project we called Open Materials.

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:09.299
It's a website where we,

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.811
and anyone else who wants to join us,

00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:14.867
share experiments, publish information,

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:18.067
encourage others to contribute whenever they can,

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:22.076
and aggregate resources such as research papers

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:25.416
and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:28.038
We would like it to become a large,

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:30.576
collectively generated database

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:34.869
of do-it-yourself information on smart materials.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.089
But why should we care

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:40.852
how smart materials work and what they are made of?

00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:45.030
First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.382
and what we don't understand and use

00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:49.590
ends up shaping us.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.342
The objects we use, the clothes we wear,

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:55.906
the houses we live in, all have a profound impact

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:59.489
on our behavior, health and quality of life.

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:02.630
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.989
we should know and understand them.

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.333
Secondly, and just as important,

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.693
innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.

00:05:11.693 --> 00:05:15.078
So many times, amateurs, not experts,

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.397
have been the inventors and improvers

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:19.877
of things ranging from mountain bikes

00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:23.189
to semiconductors, personal computers,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.128
airplanes.

00:05:26.128 --> 00:05:30.157
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:32.653
and requires expensive equipment.

00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:34.821
But that's not always the case.

00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:38.409
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.009
when they published a paper on a simpler method

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.429
for making conductive ink.

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:45.341
Jordan Bunker, who had had

00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:48.301
no experience with chemistry until then,

00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:51.088
read this paper and reproduced the experiment

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:55.477
at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:57.069
and tools.

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.670
He used a toaster oven,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.636
and he even made his own vortex mixer,

00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:05.671
based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.

00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:08.423
Jordan then published his results online,

00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:11.911
including all the things he had tried and didn't work,

00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:15.055
so others could study and reproduce it.

00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:17.727
So Jordan's main form of innovation

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:21.606
was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab

00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:23.108
at the university

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:26.295
and recreate it in a garage in Chicago

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:30.556
using only cheap materials and tools he made himself.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.829
And now that he published this work,

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:34.553
others can pick up where he left

00:06:34.553 --> 00:06:39.097
and devise even simpler processes and improvements.

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:41.313
Another example I'd like to mention

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:44.978
is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:47.858
Her project's goal is to highlight

00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:50.330
the expressive qualities of materials

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.354
while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.

00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:57.794
Electronics kits are very powerful

00:06:57.794 --> 00:07:00.346
in that they teach us how things work,

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:03.322
but the constraints inherent in their design

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:05.482
influence the way we learn.

00:07:05.482 --> 00:07:07.970
So Hannah's approach, on the other hand,

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.186
is to formulate a series of techniques

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:13.885
for creating unusual objects

00:07:13.885 --> 00:07:16.690
that free us from pre-designed constraints

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.101
by teaching us about the materials themselves.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:22.834
So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,

00:07:22.834 --> 00:07:24.804
this is one of my favorites.

00:07:24.804 --> 00:07:28.221
["Paper speakers"]

00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.499
What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:35.941
with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:37.594
and a magnet.

00:07:37.594 --> 00:07:45.243
(Music: "Happy Together")

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:52.027
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,

00:07:52.027 --> 00:07:54.810
Hannah created a series of paper speakers

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.213
out of a wide range of materials

00:07:57.213 --> 00:08:01.488
from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.

00:08:01.488 --> 00:08:04.224
Just like Jordan and so many other makers,

00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:05.851
Hannah published her recipes

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:10.985
and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:14.189
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:15.996
of material science

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:20.198
in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.754
So Hannah's artisanal work,

00:08:22.754 --> 00:08:25.002
and the fact that she shared her findings,

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:28.822
opens the doors to a series of new possibilities

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:34.262
that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:37.167
So the interesting thing about makers

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:40.210
is that we create out of passion and curiosity,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.289
and we are not afraid to fail.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.177
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,

00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:49.166
and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.598
or even better ways to do things.

00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:55.366
So the more people experiment with materials,

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:58.842
the more researchers are willing to share their research,

00:08:58.842 --> 00:09:01.282
and manufacturers their knowledge,

00:09:01.282 --> 00:09:04.122
the better chances we have to create technologies

00:09:04.122 --> 00:09:07.060
that truly serve us all.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.553
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have

00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:13.264
when, in the early 1970s, he wrote,

00:09:13.264 --> 00:09:16.262
"You must understand computers now."

00:09:16.262 --> 00:09:20.116
Back then, computers were these large mainframes

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:22.246
only scientists cared about,

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:24.966
and no one dreamed of even having one at home.

00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:27.942
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.982
"You must understand smart materials now."

00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:34.718
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge

00:09:34.718 --> 00:09:36.982
about emerging technologies

00:09:36.982 --> 00:09:39.379
is the best way to ensure that we have a say

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.542
in the making of our future.

00:09:41.542 --> 00:09:44.013
Thank you.

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:48.013
(Applause)
