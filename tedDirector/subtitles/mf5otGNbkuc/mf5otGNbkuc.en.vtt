00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.151
I want to start with a game. Okay?

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:18.570
And to win this game,

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:21.483
all you have to do is see
the reality that's in front of you

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.499
as it really is, all right?

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.110
So we have two panels here,
of colored dots.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.331
And one of those dots
is the same in the two panels.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.578
And you have to tell me which one.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.050
Now, I narrowed it down

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:41.745
to the gray one, the green one,
and, say, the orange one.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.832
So by a show of hands,
we'll start with the easiest one.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:47.570
Show of hands: how many people
think it's the gray one?

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:50.136
Really? Okay.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.134
How many people think it's the green one?

00:00:54.737 --> 00:00:57.171
And how many people
think it's the orange one?

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:00.920
Pretty even split.

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:04.750
Let's find out what the reality is.

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:06.594
Here is the orange one.

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:09.309
(Laughter)

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.484
Here is the green one.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.373
And here is the gray one.

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:20.136
(Laughter)

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.959
So for all of you who saw that,
you're complete realists.

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:24.601
All right?

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.136
(Laughter)

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.931
So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.757
Because nearly every living system

00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:33.689
has evolved the ability
to detect light in one way or another.

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:35.554
So for us, seeing color

00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.888
is one of the simplest things
the brain does.

00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:40.713
And yet, even at this
most fundamental level,

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.356
context is everything.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.561
What I'm going to talk about
is not that context is everything,

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.610
but why context is everything.

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.850
Because it's answering that question

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:54.418
that tells us not only
why we see what we do,

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.136
but who we are as individuals,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.041
and who we are as a society.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.712
But first, we have to ask
another question,

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:03.244
which is, "What is color for?"

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:05.483
And instead of telling you,
I'll just show you.

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:08.136
What you see here is a jungle scene,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.944
and you see the surfaces
according to the amount of light

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:12.633
that those surfaces reflect.

00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:17.040
Now, can any of you see the predator
that's about to jump out at you?

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:20.088
And if you haven't seen it yet,
you're dead, right?

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:21.113
(Laughter)

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:23.475
Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.968
Now let's see the surfaces

00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:27.846
according to the quality of light
that they reflect.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.411
And now you see it.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.754
So, color enables us to see

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.204
the similarities and differences
between surfaces,

00:02:35.228 --> 00:02:38.274
according to the full spectrum
of light that they reflect.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:39.759
But what you've just done

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.823
is in many respects
mathematically impossible.

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:44.094
Why?

00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:45.548
Because, as Berkeley tells us,

00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:48.135
we have no direct access
to our physical world,

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.136
other than through our senses.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.975
And the light that falls onto our eyes

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.261
is determined by multiple
things in the world,

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:56.136
not only the color of objects,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.136
but also the color of their illumination,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.969
and the color of the space
between us and those objects.

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:03.246
You vary any one of those parameters,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.792
and you'll change the color
of the light that falls onto your eye.

00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:09.492
This is a huge problem,

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:12.485
because it means that the same image

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.030
could have an infinite number
of possible real-world sources.

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:17.395
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.252
Imagine that this
is the back of your eye, okay?

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:22.776
And these are two projections
from the world.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.263
They're identical in every single way.

00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:29.319
Identical in shape,
size, spectral content.

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.112
They are the same,
as far as your eye is concerned.

00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:37.252
And yet they come
from completely different sources.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.881
The one on the right
comes from a yellow surface,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:45.310
in shadow, oriented facing the left,

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:48.206
viewed through a pinkish medium.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.474
The one on the left comes
from an orange surface,

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.681
under direct light, facing to the right,

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:55.689
viewed through sort of a bluish medium.

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.888
Completely different meanings,

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:01.189
giving rise to the exact same
retinal information.

00:04:01.213 --> 00:04:04.530
And yet it's only the retinal
information that we get.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.522
So how on Earth do we even see?

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:11.753
So if you remember anything
in this next 18 minutes,

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:13.023
remember this:

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:14.989
that the light that falls onto your eye,

00:04:15.013 --> 00:04:17.436
sensory information, is meaningless,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.578
because it could mean literally anything.

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:23.703
And what's true for sensory information
is true for information generally.

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:25.760
There's no inherent
meaning in information.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:28.197
It's what we do with that
information that matters.

00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:32.618
So, how do we see?
Well, we see by learning to see.

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:36.181
The brain evolved the mechanisms
for finding patterns,

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:38.245
finding relationships in information,

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:42.467
and associating those relationships
with a behavioral meaning,

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.356
a significance, by interacting
with the world.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.135
We're very aware of this

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.988
in the form of more cognitive
attributes, like language.

00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:52.045
I'm going to give you some letter strings,

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.562
and I want you to read them
out for me, if you can.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.251
Audience: "Can you read this?"

00:04:57.092 --> 00:04:59.136
"You are not reading this."

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.036
"What are you reading?"

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.444
Beau Lotto: "What are you reading?"
Half the letters are missing, right?

00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:05.777
There's no a priori reason

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.293
why an "H" has to go
between that "W" and "A."

00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:09.872
But you put one there. Why?

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:12.252
Because in the statistics
of your past experience,

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:13.970
it would have been useful to do so.

00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:15.435
So you do so again.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.136
And yet you don't put a letter
after that first "T."

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.024
Why? Because it wouldn't have been
useful in the past.

00:05:21.048 --> 00:05:23.136
So you don't do it again.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.029
So, let me show you how quickly
our brains can redefine normality,

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:29.783
even at the simplest thing
the brain does, which is color.

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:32.441
So if I could have
the lights down up here.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:36.264
I want you to first notice that those
two desert scenes are physically the same.

00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:38.465
One is simply the flipping of the other.

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:42.554
Now I want you to look at that dot

00:05:42.578 --> 00:05:45.135
between the green and the red.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.136
And I want you to stare at that dot.
Don't look anywhere else.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.366
We're going to look
at it for about 30 seconds,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.832
which is a bit of a killer
in an 18-minute talk.

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:54.149
(Laughter)

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.767
But I really want you to learn.

00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:58.092
And I'll tell you -- don't look
anywhere else --

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:00.171
I'll tell you what's
happening in your head.

00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:01.462
Your brain is learning,

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.214
and it's learning
that the right side of its visual field

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:05.531
is under red illumination;

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:08.482
the left side of its visual field
is under green illumination.

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:11.392
That's what it's learning. Okay?

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:16.095
Now, when I tell you, I want you to look
at the dot between the two desert scenes.

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.134
So why don't you do that now?

00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:21.518
(Laughter)

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:23.445
Can I have the lights up again?

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.935
I take it from your response
they don't look the same anymore, right?

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.136
(Applause)

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.136
Why? Because your brain
is seeing that same information

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.847
as if the right one is still
under red light,

00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:36.029
and the left one is still
under green light.

00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:37.418
That's your new normal.

00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:39.448
Okay? So, what does this mean for context?

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:41.806
It means I can take two identical squares,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.650
put them in light and dark surrounds,

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.159
and the one on the dark surround
looks lighter than on the light surround.

00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:50.767
What's significant is not simply the light
and dark surrounds that matter.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:54.436
It's what those light and dark surrounds
meant for your behavior in the past.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.857
So I'll show you what I mean.

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.864
Here we have that exact same illusion.

00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.014
We have two identical tiles on the left,

00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:02.324
one in a dark surround,
one in a light surround.

00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:04.427
And the same thing over on the right.

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.302
Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.994
but I'm not going to change
anything within those boxes,

00:07:10.018 --> 00:07:11.169
except their meaning.

00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:13.506
And see what happens to your perception.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.136
Notice that on the left

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.925
the two tiles look nearly
completely opposite:

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.040
one very white and one very dark, right?

00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:24.339
Whereas on the right,
the two tiles look nearly the same.

00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:26.601
And yet there is still one
on a dark surround,

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:27.990
and one on a light surround.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:29.165
Why?

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.136
Because if the tile in that shadow
were in fact in shadow,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.589
and reflecting the same
amount of light to your eye

00:07:35.613 --> 00:07:37.381
as the one outside the shadow,

00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:40.802
it would have to be more reflective
-- just the laws of physics.

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.344
So you see it that way.

00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:45.026
Whereas on the right,
the information is consistent

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.733
with those two tiles
being under the same light.

00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.590
If they're under the same light reflecting
the same amount of light to your eye,

00:07:51.614 --> 00:07:53.399
then they must be equally reflective.

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:54.686
So you see it that way.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.236
Which means we can bring
all this information together

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.308
to create some incredibly
strong illusions.

00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:01.136
This is one I made a few years ago.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.473
And you'll notice you see
a dark brown tile at the top,

00:08:04.497 --> 00:08:06.976
and a bright orange tile at the side.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.730
That is your perceptual reality.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.718
The physical reality
is that those two tiles are the same.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.136
Here you see four gray tiles on your left,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.672
seven gray tiles on the right.

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:21.753
I'm not going to change
those tiles at all,

00:08:21.777 --> 00:08:23.944
but I'm going to reveal
the rest of the scene.

00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:25.926
And see what happens to your perception.

00:08:26.521 --> 00:08:30.030
The four blue tiles on the left are gray.

00:08:30.054 --> 00:08:33.707
The seven yellow tiles
on the right are also gray.

00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:35.612
They are the same. Okay?

00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:37.674
Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:43.812
What's true for color is also true
for complex perceptions of motion.

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.645
So, here we have --

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.933
let's turn this around -- a diamond.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.780
And what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to hold it here,

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:55.650
and I'm going to spin it.

00:08:56.991 --> 00:09:00.135
And for all of you, you'll see it
probably spinning this direction.

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.771
Now I want you to keep looking at it.

00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:05.295
Move your eyes around,
blink, maybe close one eye.

00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:09.136
And suddenly it will flip, and start
spinning the opposite direction.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.332
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?

00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:13.563
Keep blinking.

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:16.172
Every time you blink, it will switch.

00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:18.793
So I can ask you,
which direction is it rotating?

00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:21.587
How do you know?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.410
Your brain doesn't know,
because both are equally likely.

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:26.972
So depending on where it looks,

00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:30.325
it flips between the two possibilities.

00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:32.273
Are we the only ones that see illusions?

00:09:32.297 --> 00:09:34.136
The answer to this question is no.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.879
Even the beautiful bumblebee,

00:09:35.903 --> 00:09:38.777
with its mere one million brain cells,

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:41.816
which is 250 times fewer cells
than you have in one retina,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.668
sees illusions, does
the most complicated things

00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:47.136
that even our most
sophisticated computers can't do.

00:09:47.501 --> 00:09:49.357
So in my lab we work on bumblebees,

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.870
because we can completely
control their experience,

00:09:51.894 --> 00:09:54.427
and see how it alters
the architecture of their brain.

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:56.552
We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.

00:09:56.576 --> 00:09:57.850
Here you have the hive.

00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:00.469
You can see the queen bee,
the large bee in the middle.

00:10:00.493 --> 00:10:02.119
Those are her daughters, the eggs.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.758
They go back and forth between this hive
and the arena, via this tube.

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.589
You'll see one of the bees come out here.

00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:13.707
You see how she has
a little number on her?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.096
There's another one coming out,
she also has a number on her.

00:10:17.585 --> 00:10:19.856
Now, they're not born that way, right?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.895
We pull them out, put them
in the fridge, and they fall asleep.

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:25.212
Then you can superglue
little numbers on them.

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:26.419
(Laughter)

00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:30.136
And now, in this experiment they get
a reward if they go to the blue flowers.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.353
They land on the flower,

00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.886
stick their tongue in there,
called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.068
She's drinking a glass of water
that's about that big to you and I,

00:10:38.092 --> 00:10:41.726
will do that about three times, then fly.

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:46.344
And sometimes they learn
not to go to the blue,

00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:48.136
but to go where the other bees go.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.374
So they copy each other.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:51.684
They can count to five.
They can recognize faces.

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.669
And here she comes down the ladder.

00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:56.274
And she'll come into the hive,
find an empty honey pot,

00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:58.355
and throw up, and that's honey.

00:10:58.379 --> 00:10:59.530
(Laughter)

00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:04.364
Now remember, she's supposed
to be going to the blue flowers,

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:07.015
but what are these bees doing
in the upper right corner?

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.528
It looks like they're
going to green flowers.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:12.358
Now, are they getting it wrong?

00:11:12.382 --> 00:11:15.874
And the answer to the question is no.
Those are actually blue flowers.

00:11:15.898 --> 00:11:19.461
But those are blue flowers
under green light.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:23.217
So they're using the relationships
between the colors to solve the puzzle,

00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:25.312
which is exactly what we do.

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:27.667
So, illusions are often used,

00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.302
especially in art, in the words
of a more contemporary artist,

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:33.786
"to demonstrate the fragility
of our senses."

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.134
Okay, this is complete rubbish.

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:40.108
The senses aren't fragile.
And if they were, we wouldn't be here.

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:43.031
Instead, color tells us
something completely different,

00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:46.423
that the brain didn't actually evolve
to see the world the way it is.

00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:47.658
We can't.

00:11:47.682 --> 00:11:50.094
Instead, the brain
evolved to see the world

00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:53.136
the way it was useful to see in the past.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.331
And how we see is by continually
redefining normality.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:06.522
So, how can we take this incredible
capacity of plasticity of the brain

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:09.070
and get people to experience
their world differently?

00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:11.791
Well, one of the ways we do it
in my lab and studio

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:15.053
is we translate the light into sound,

00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:18.151
and we enable people to hear
their visual world.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.818
And they can navigate
the world using their ears.

00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:25.781
Here's David on the right,
and he's holding a camera.

00:12:25.805 --> 00:12:27.535
On the left is what his camera sees.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:30.567
And you'll see there's a faint line
going across that image.

00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:33.000
That line is broken up into 32 squares.

00:12:33.024 --> 00:12:35.351
In each square,
we calculate the average color.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.756
And then we just simply
translate that into sound.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.013
And now he's going to turn around,

00:12:41.037 --> 00:12:43.897
close his eyes,

00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:47.183
and find a plate on the ground
with his eyes closed.

00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:48.431
(Continuous sound)

00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.492
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:53.652
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:55.143 --> 00:12:57.373
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.417
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:05.123
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:13:05.773 --> 00:13:07.714
Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?

00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:10.801
So not only can we create a prosthetic
for the visually impaired,

00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:13.308
but we can also investigate

00:13:13.332 --> 00:13:16.028
how people literally
make sense of the world.

00:13:16.052 --> 00:13:17.687
But we can also do something else.

00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:20.799
We can also make music with color.

00:13:20.823 --> 00:13:22.499
So, working with kids,

00:13:22.523 --> 00:13:24.316
they created images,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.456
thinking about what might
the images you see

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.304
sound like if we could listen to them.

00:13:28.328 --> 00:13:30.136
And then we translated these images.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.136
And this is one of those images.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.136
And this is a six-year-old child
composing a piece of music

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.136
for a 32-piece orchestra.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.161
And this is what it sounds like.

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:46.863
(Electronic representation
of orchestral music)

00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:09.016
So, a six-year-old child. Okay?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.157
Now, what does all this mean?

00:14:12.753 --> 00:14:17.093
What this suggests is that no one
is an outside observer of nature, okay?

00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:19.182
We're not defined
by our central properties,

00:14:19.206 --> 00:14:20.870
by the bits that make us up.

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.568
We're defined by our environment
and our interaction with that environment,

00:14:24.592 --> 00:14:26.244
by our ecology.

00:14:26.268 --> 00:14:32.300
And that ecology is necessarily
relative, historical and empirical.

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:38.466
So, what I'd like to finish with
is this over here.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.751
Because what I've been trying to do
is really celebrate uncertainty.

00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:45.536
Because I think only through uncertainty
is there potential for understanding.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.428
So, if some of you are still
feeling a bit too certain,

00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:49.994
I'd like to do this one.

00:14:50.018 --> 00:14:52.432
So, if we have the lights down.

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:57.338
And what we have here --

00:14:58.546 --> 00:15:03.316
Can everyone see 25
purple surfaces on your left,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.532
and 25, call it yellowish,
surfaces on your right?

00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:08.870
So now, what I want to do,

00:15:08.894 --> 00:15:11.911
I'm going to put
the middle nine surfaces here

00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:13.562
under yellow illumination,

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:15.592
by simply putting a filter behind them.

00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:22.025
Now you can see that changes the light
that's coming through there, right?

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:25.130
Because now the light is going
through a yellowish filter

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:26.701
and then a purplish filter.

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:31.036
I'm going to do the opposite
on the left here.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.727
I'm going to put the middle nine
under a purplish light.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.697
Now, some of you will have noticed
that the consequence

00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.784
is that the light coming through those
middle nine on the right,

00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:48.616
or your left, is exactly
the same as the light

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.332
coming through the middle
nine on your right.

00:15:51.356 --> 00:15:53.941
Agreed? Yes?

00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:56.514
Okay. So they are physically the same.

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:59.176
Let's pull the covers off.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.501
Now remember --

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:09.583
you know that the middle nine
are exactly the same.

00:16:09.607 --> 00:16:10.826
Do they look the same?

00:16:12.462 --> 00:16:13.617
No.

00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:15.596
The question is, "Is that an illusion?"

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.027
And I'll leave you with that.

00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:18.256
So, thank you very much.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.445
(Laughter)

00:16:19.469 --> 00:16:22.160
(Applause)
