00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.235
In the space that used
to house one transistor,

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.098
we can now fit one billion.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:23.533
That made it so that a computer
the size of an entire room

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:26.146
now fits in your pocket.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.189
You might say the future is small.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.818
As an engineer,

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:34.827
I'm inspired by this miniaturization
revolution in computers.

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:36.199
As a physician,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:41.946
I wonder whether we could use it
to reduce the number of lives lost

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.077
due to one of the fastest-growing
diseases on Earth:

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:47.519
cancer.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:48.798
Now when I say that,

00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:52.600
what most people hear me say
is that we're working on curing cancer.

00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:53.887
And we are.

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.062
But it turns out

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:57.887
that there's an incredible
opportunity to save lives

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:01.244
through the early detection
and prevention of cancer.

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:07.164
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths
due to cancer are fully preventable

00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.988
using methods that we already
have in hand today.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.305
Things like vaccination, timely screening

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.562
and of course, stopping smoking.

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:19.909
But even with the best tools
and technologies that we have today,

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.996
some tumors can't be detected

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.690
until 10 years after
they've started growing,

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:29.477
when they are 50 million
cancer cells strong.

00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:31.857
What if we had better technologies

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.987
to detect some of these more
deadly cancers sooner,

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.313
when they could be removed,

00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:38.538
when they were just getting started?

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.837
Let me tell you about how
miniaturization might get us there.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.428
This is a microscope in a typical lab

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:49.008
that a pathologist would use
for looking at a tissue specimen,

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.470
like a biopsy or a pap smear.

00:01:51.927 --> 00:01:53.995
This $7,000 microscope

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:57.275
would be used by somebody
with years of specialized training

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.088
to spot cancer cells.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:03.172
This is an image from a colleague
of mine at Rice University,

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:04.774
Rebecca Richards-Kortum.

00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:08.625
What she and her team have done
is miniaturize that whole microscope

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.624
into this $10 part,

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:13.464
and it fits on the end
of an optical fiber.

00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:17.557
Now what that means is instead
of taking a sample from a patient

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.230
and sending it to the microscope,

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:21.810
you can bring the microscope
to the patient.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.619
And then, instead of requiring
a specialist to look at the images,

00:02:26.643 --> 00:02:31.705
you can train the computer to score
normal versus cancerous cells.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.254
Now this is important,

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.315
because what they found
working in rural communities,

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.578
is that even when they have
a mobile screening van

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:42.435
that can go out into the community
and perform exams

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.864
and collect samples

00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:47.104
and send them to the central
hospital for analysis,

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:48.472
that days later,

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:51.163
women get a call
with an abnormal test result

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:52.804
and they're asked to come in.

00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:57.171
Fully half of them don't turn up
because they can't afford the trip.

00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:01.145
With the integrated microscope
and computer analysis,

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.997
Rebecca and her colleagues
have been able to create a van

00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:07.807
that has both a diagnostic setup
and a treatment setup.

00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:10.545
And what that means
is that they can do a diagnosis

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.256
and perform therapy on the spot,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.418
so no one is lost to follow up.

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:19.779
That's just one example of how
miniaturization can save lives.

00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:21.301
Now as engineers,

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:24.070
we think of this
as straight-up miniaturization.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:26.531
You took a big thing
and you made it little.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.806
But what I told you before about computers

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.076
was that they transformed our lives

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.401
when they became small enough
for us to take them everywhere.

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:40.081
So what is the transformational
equivalent like that in medicine?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.636
Well, what if you had a detector

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.922
that was so small that it could
circulate in your body,

00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:50.359
find the tumor all by itself

00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.752
and send a signal to the outside world?

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.156
It sounds a little bit
like science fiction.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.083
But actually, nanotechnology
allows us to do just that.

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:04.296
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink
the parts that make up the detector

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.157
from the width of a human hair,

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.841
which is 100 microns,

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:10.420
to a thousand times smaller,

00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:12.346
which is 100 nanometers.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.180
And that has profound implications.

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:19.226
It turns out that materials
actually change their properties

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.846
at the nanoscale.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.777
You take a common material like gold,

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.122
and you grind it into dust,
into gold nanoparticles,

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:30.458
and it changes from looking
gold to looking red.

00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:34.895
If you take a more exotic material
like cadmium selenide --

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.093
forms a big, black crystal --

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:39.718
if you make nanocrystals
out of this material

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:41.315
and you put it in a liquid,

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.163
and you shine light on it,

00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:44.353
they glow.

00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:50.008
And they glow blue, green,
yellow, orange, red,

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:52.307
depending only on their size.

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:56.890
It's wild! Can you imagine an object
like that in the macro world?

00:04:56.914 --> 00:05:03.485
It would be like all the denim jeans
in your closet are all made of cotton,

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.820
but they are different colors
depending only on their size.

00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:09.908
(Laughter)

00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:12.506
So as a physician,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.754
what's just as interesting to me

00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:17.078
is that it's not just
the color of materials

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:19.033
that changes at the nanoscale;

00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:22.665
the way they travel
in your body also changes.

00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:25.936
And this is the kind of observation
that we're going to use

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.134
to make a better cancer detector.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:29.911
So let me show you what I mean.

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.883
This is a blood vessel in the body.

00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:35.318
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.

00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:38.724
We're going to inject nanoparticles
into the blood vessel

00:05:38.748 --> 00:05:42.928
and watch how they travel
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:47.816
Now it turns out that the blood vessels
of many tumors are leaky,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.206
and so nanoparticles can leak out
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.762
Whether they leak out
depends on their size.

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:57.279
So in this image,

00:05:57.303 --> 00:06:01.674
the smaller, hundred-nanometer,
blue nanoparticles are leaking out,

00:06:01.698 --> 00:06:05.094
and the larger, 500-nanometer,
red nanoparticles

00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:06.895
are stuck in the bloodstream.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.022
So that means as an engineer,

00:06:09.046 --> 00:06:13.038
depending on how big
or small I make a material,

00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:16.103
I can change where it goes in your body.

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.891
In my lab, we recently made
a cancer nanodetector

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:27.163
that is so small that it could travel
into the body and look for tumors.

00:06:27.477 --> 00:06:31.569
We designed it to listen
for tumor invasion:

00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:36.366
the orchestra of chemical signals
that tumors need to make to spread.

00:06:36.932 --> 00:06:39.834
For a tumor to break out
of the tissue that it's born in,

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.574
it has to make chemicals called enzymes

00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:45.182
to chew through
the scaffolding of tissues.

00:06:45.763 --> 00:06:50.485
We designed these nanoparticles
to be activated by these enzymes.

00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:56.946
One enzyme can activate a thousand
of these chemical reactions in an hour.

00:06:57.462 --> 00:07:01.020
Now in engineering, we call
that one-to-a-thousand ratio

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:02.609
a form of amplification,

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:04.805
and it makes something ultrasensitive.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:08.662
So we've made an ultrasensitive
cancer detector.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.120
OK, but how do I get this activated
signal to the outside world,

00:07:14.144 --> 00:07:15.882
where I can act on it?

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:19.458
For this, we're going to use
one more piece of nanoscale biology,

00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:21.266
and that has to do with the kidney.

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:23.575
The kidney is a filter.

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:28.625
Its job is to filter out the blood
and put waste into the urine.

00:07:29.197 --> 00:07:31.859
It turns out that what the kidney filters

00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:34.445
is also dependent on size.

00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:36.841
So in this image, what you can see

00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:39.874
is that everything smaller
than five nanometers

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:44.003
is going from the blood,
through the kidney, into the urine,

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:46.697
and everything else
that's bigger is retained.

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:52.123
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer
cancer detector,

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:54.619
I inject it in the bloodstream,

00:07:54.643 --> 00:08:00.073
it can leak into the tumor
where it's activated by tumor enzymes

00:08:00.097 --> 00:08:02.453
to release a small signal

00:08:02.477 --> 00:08:05.699
that is small enough to be
filtered out of the kidney

00:08:05.723 --> 00:08:07.901
and put into the urine,

00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:11.966
I have a signal in the outside world
that I can detect.

00:08:12.588 --> 00:08:14.640
OK, but there's one more problem.

00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:16.410
This is a tiny little signal,

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.406
so how do I detect it?

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.965
Well, the signal is just a molecule.

00:08:20.989 --> 00:08:23.656
They're molecules
that we designed as engineers.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.858
They're completely synthetic,
and we can design them

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:30.121
so they are compatible
with our tool of choice.

00:08:30.145 --> 00:08:33.587
If we want to use a really
sensitive, fancy instrument

00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:35.575
called a mass spectrometer,

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.110
then we make a molecule
with a unique mass.

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:42.370
Or maybe we want make something
that's more inexpensive and portable.

00:08:42.394 --> 00:08:46.177
Then we make molecules
that we can trap on paper,

00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:47.905
like a pregnancy test.

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:50.555
In fact, there's a whole
world of paper tests

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:55.091
that are becoming available
in a field called paper diagnostics.

00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.037
Alright, where are we going with this?

00:08:58.724 --> 00:09:00.293
What I'm going to tell you next,

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:02.143
as a lifelong researcher,

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.046
represents a dream of mine.

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:06.489
I can't say that's it's a promise;

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.005
it's a dream.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:11.616
But I think we all have to have dreams
to keep us pushing forward,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.577
even -- and maybe especially --
cancer researchers.

00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.100
I'm going to tell you what I hope
will happen with my technology,

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:23.215
that my team and I will put
our hearts and souls

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:24.761
into making a reality.

00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:26.987
OK, here goes.

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:30.366
I dream that one day,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.645
instead of going into
an expensive screening facility

00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:35.174
to get a colonoscopy,

00:09:35.198 --> 00:09:36.521
or a mammogram,

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:37.953
or a pap smear,

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:40.304
that you could get a shot,

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:41.988
wait an hour,

00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:44.807
and do a urine test on a paper strip.

00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:48.460
I imagine that this could even happen

00:09:48.484 --> 00:09:51.147
without the need for steady electricity,

00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:53.775
or a medical professional in the room.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:55.296
Maybe they could be far away

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.130
and connected only by the image
on a smartphone.

00:09:58.854 --> 00:10:00.589
Now I know this sounds like a dream,

00:10:00.613 --> 00:10:03.732
but in the lab we already
have this working in mice,

00:10:03.756 --> 00:10:05.835
where it works better
than existing methods

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.830
for the detection of lung,
colon and ovarian cancer.

00:10:10.603 --> 00:10:12.837
And I hope that what this means

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:18.037
is that one day we can
detect tumors in patients

00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:21.354
sooner than 10 years
after they've started growing,

00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:23.363
in all walks of life,

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:25.236
all around the globe,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.995
and that this would lead
to earlier treatments,

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.617
and that we could save more lives
than we can today,

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.925
with early detection.

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:34.868
Thank you.

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:42.375
