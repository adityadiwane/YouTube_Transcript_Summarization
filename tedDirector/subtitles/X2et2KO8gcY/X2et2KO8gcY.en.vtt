00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.736
People say things about religion all the time.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.710
(Laughter)

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.960
The late, great Christopher Hitchens

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.381
wrote a book called "God Is Not Great"

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.913
whose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything."

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.286
(Laughter)

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:31.380
But last month, in Time magazine,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.393
Rabbi David Wolpe, who I gather
is referred to as America's rabbi,

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:40.031
said, to balance that against
that negative characterization,

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:42.655
that no important form of social change

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.995
can be brought about except through organized religion.

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:48.973
Now, remarks of this sort on the negative

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:52.010
and the positive side are very old.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.451
I have one in my pocket here

00:00:54.451 --> 00:01:00.366
from the first century BCE by Lucretius,

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.229
the author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.512
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" --

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:10.134
I should have been able to learn that by heart â€”

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:12.822
which is, that's how much religion

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.332
is able to persuade people to do evil,

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:17.119
and he was talking about the fact

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.164
of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:22.075
Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:25.575
in order to preserve the prospects of his army.

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:28.471
So there have been these long debates

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.360
over the centuries, in that case, actually,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.946
we can say over the millennia, about religion.

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.799
People have talked about it a lot,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.597
and they've said good and bad

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:39.106
and indifferent things about it.

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:40.841
What I want to persuade you of today

00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.444
is of a very simple claim,

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:44.681
which is that these debates are

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:47.174
in a certain sense preposterous,

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:51.345
because there is no such thing as religion

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.080
about which to make these claims.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.468
There isn't a thing called religion,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:57.519
and so it can't be good or bad.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.680
It can't even be indifferent.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.139
And if you think about claims

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.127
about the nonexistence of things,

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:08.319
one obvious way to try and establish

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.771
the nonexistence of a purported thing

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.229
would be to offer a definition of that thing

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.990
and then to see whether anything satisfied it.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.202
I'm going to start out on that little route

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.411
to begin with.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.988
So if you look in the dictionaries

00:02:22.988 --> 00:02:24.138
and if you think about it,

00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:26.507
one very natural definition of religion

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:32.324
is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:33.830
As I say, this is in many dictionaries,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.581
but you'll also find it actually

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.208
in the work of Sir Edward Tylor,

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.435
who was the first professor
of anthropology at Oxford,

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:42.431
one of the first modern anthropologists.

00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:44.665
In his book on primitive culture,

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.685
he says the heart of religion
is what he called animism,

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:49.403
that is, the belief in spiritual agency,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.780
belief in spirits.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.788
The first problem for that definition

00:02:53.788 --> 00:02:56.528
is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff."

00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:57.934
There's a guy talking to a rabbi.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:00.330
The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.760
The guy says, "You're a rabbi,
how can you not believe in God?"

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.151
And the reply is, "It's what's
so great about being Jewish.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:08.114
You don't have to believe in a God per se,

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:10.570
just in being Jewish." (Laughter)

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.598
So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:16.790
and if you have to believe in
God in order to be religious,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.073
then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:22.265
that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.154
without believing in God,

00:03:24.154 --> 00:03:26.504
Judaism isn't a religion.

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:29.970
That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.231
Here's another argument against this view.

00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.403
A friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.586
went to his grandfather when he was very young,

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:38.721
a child, and said to him,

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:40.840
"I want to talk to you about religion,"

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.085
and his grandfather said, "You're too young.

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:43.616
Come back when you're a teenager."

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:45.459
So he came back when he was a teenager,

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.155
and he said to his grandfather,

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:48.481
"It may be a bit late now

00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:52.221
because I've discovered that
I don't believe in the gods."

00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:54.248
And his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,

00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:56.432
"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:59.618
of the Hindu tradition." (Laughter)

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:03.320
And finally, there's this guy,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.776
who famously doesn't believe in God.

00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:07.594
His name is the Dalai Lama.

00:04:07.594 --> 00:04:10.242
He often jokes that he's one
of the world's leading atheists.

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:13.186
But it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.966
does not involve belief in God.

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.579
Now you might think this just shows

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.599
that I've given you the wrong definition

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.718
and that I should come up with some other definition

00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:24.416
and test it against these cases

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:26.987
and try and find something that captures

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:29.913
atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:33.176
and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:34.970
but I actually think that that's a bad idea,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.299
and the reason I think it's a bad idea

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.934
is that I don't think that's how

00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:40.565
our concept of religion works.

00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.165
I think the way our concept of religion works

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:45.203
is that we actually have, we have a list

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.129
of paradigm religions

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.368
and their sub-parts, right,

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.922
and if something new comes along

00:04:52.922 --> 00:04:54.428
that purports to be a religion,

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.892
what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?"

00:04:56.892 --> 00:04:59.144
Right?

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:01.719
And I think that's not only
how we think about religion,

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.019
and that's, as it were,

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:04.810
so from our point of view,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.893
anything on that list had better be a religion,

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:08.661
which is why I don't think an account of religion

00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:10.516
that excludes Buddhism and Judaism

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:13.216
has a chance of being a good starter,

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:15.920
because they're on our list.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.900
But why do we have such a list?

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.730
What's going on? How did it come about

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.917
that we have this list?

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:24.832
I think the answer is a pretty simple one

00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:27.960
and therefore crude and contentious.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.349
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.943
but here's my story,

00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:33.314
and true or not, it's a story that I think

00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:35.742
gives you a good sense of how

00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:37.431
the list might have come about,

00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:38.740
and therefore helps you to think about

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.184
what use the list might be.

00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:43.472
I think the answer is, European travelers,

00:05:43.472 --> 00:05:45.305
starting roughly about the time of Columbus,

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:46.930
started going around the world.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.210
They came from a Christian culture,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.020
and when they arrived in a new place,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.905
they noticed that some people
didn't have Christianity,

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:55.950
and so they asked themselves
the following question:

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.140
what have they got instead of Christianity?

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.503
And that list was essentially constructed.

00:06:02.503 --> 00:06:04.779
It consists of the things that other people had

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.370
instead of Christianity.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.738
Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,

00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:13.178
which is that Christianity is extremely,

00:06:13.178 --> 00:06:17.590
even on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.151
It has all kinds of things in it

00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:21.277
that are very, very particular

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:23.573
that are the results of the specifics

00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:26.260
of Christian history,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.857
and one thing that's at the heart of it,

00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:30.660
one thing that's at the heart of
most understandings of Christianity,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.990
which is the result of the
specific history of Christianity,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.133
is that it's an extremely creedal religion.

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.813
It's a religion in which people are really concerned

00:06:38.813 --> 00:06:41.552
about whether you believe the right things.

00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:43.808
The history of Christianity, the
internal history of Christianity,

00:06:43.808 --> 00:06:45.684
is largely the history of people killing each other

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:47.800
because they believed the wrong thing,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.879
and it's also involved in

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.631
struggles with other religions,

00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:55.230
obviously starting in the Middle Ages,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.620
a struggle with Islam,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.740
in which, again, it was the infidelity,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.770
the fact that they didn't believe the right things,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.150
that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.788
Now that's a very specific and particular history

00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:10.153
that Christianity has,

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:13.371
and not everywhere is everything

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.365
that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.

00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:18.772
Here's another problem, I think.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.110
A very specific thing happened.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.562
It was actually adverted to earlier,

00:07:21.562 --> 00:07:23.103
but a very specific thing happened

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:25.292
in the history of the kind of Christianity

00:07:25.292 --> 00:07:26.813
that we see around us

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.997
mostly in the United States today,

00:07:28.997 --> 00:07:32.100
and it happened in the late 19th century,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.509
and that specific thing that happened

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:34.518
in the late 19th century

00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:37.473
was a kind of deal that was cut

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:39.983
between science,

00:07:39.983 --> 00:07:45.676
this new way of organizing intellectual authority,

00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:46.873
and religion.

00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:48.764
If you think about the 18th century, say,

00:07:48.764 --> 00:07:50.234
if you think about intellectual life

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:52.590
before the late 19th century,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.760
anything you did, anything you thought about,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.490
whether it was the physical world,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.021
the human world,

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.251
the natural world apart from the human world,

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.218
or morality, anything you did

00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:05.894
would have been framed against the background

00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:08.357
of a set of assumptions that were religious,

00:08:08.357 --> 00:08:09.560
Christian assumptions.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.226
You couldn't give an account

00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:12.822
of the natural world

00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:15.744
that didn't say something about its relationship,

00:08:15.744 --> 00:08:17.552
for example, to the creation story

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:19.092
in the Abrahamic tradition,

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:22.296
the creation story in the first book of the Torah.

00:08:22.296 --> 00:08:25.613
So everything was framed in that way.

00:08:25.613 --> 00:08:28.045
But this changes in the late 19th century,

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:30.370
and for the first time, it's possible for people

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.749
to develop serious intellectual careers

00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:34.943
as natural historians like Darwin.

00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:36.928
Darwin worried about the relationship between

00:08:36.928 --> 00:08:39.481
what he said and the truths of religion,

00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:41.406
but he could proceed, he could write books

00:08:41.406 --> 00:08:43.190
about his subject

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.886
without having to say what the relationship was

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:47.358
to the religious claims,

00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:49.740
and similarly, geologists
increasingly could talk about it.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.542
In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.465
and made a claim about the age of the Earth,

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.107
you had to explain whether that was consistent

00:08:55.107 --> 00:08:56.537
or how it was or wasn't consistent

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:57.909
with the age of the Earth implied

00:08:57.909 --> 00:08:59.462
by the account in Genesis.

00:08:59.462 --> 00:09:00.647
By the end of the 19th century,

00:09:00.647 --> 00:09:02.160
you can just write a geology textbook

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.519
in which you make arguments
about how old the Earth is.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.610
So there's a big change, and that division,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.545
that intellectual division of
labor occurs as I say, I think,

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:12.370
and it sort of solidifies so that by the end

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.528
of the 19th century in Europe,

00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:17.519
there's a real intellectual division of labor,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.519
and you can do all sorts of serious things,

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:23.421
including, increasingly, even philosophy,

00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:26.279
without being constrained by the thought,

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.560
"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.239
with the deep truths that are given to me

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:33.749
by our religious tradition."

00:09:33.749 --> 00:09:35.913
So imagine someone who's coming out

00:09:35.913 --> 00:09:39.730
of that world, that late-19th-century world,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.482
coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.742
the society that I grew up in, Asante,

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.148
coming into that world

00:09:47.148 --> 00:09:49.164
at the turn of the 20th century

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:51.187
with this question that made the list:

00:09:51.187 --> 00:09:54.950
what have they got instead of Christianity?

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.807
Well, here's one thing he would have noticed,

00:09:57.807 --> 00:10:00.151
and by the way, there was a 
person who actually did this.

00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:01.450
His name was Captain Rattray,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.502
he was sent as the British
government anthropologist,

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.495
and he wrote a book about Asante religion.

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.035
This is a soul disc.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.308
There are many of them in the British Museum.

00:10:10.308 --> 00:10:11.578
I could give you an interesting, different history

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.743
of how it comes about that many of the things

00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:17.134
from my society ended up in the British Museum,

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:18.945
but we don't have time for that.

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:20.437
So this object is a soul disc.

00:10:20.437 --> 00:10:21.575
What is a soul disc?

00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:23.404
It was worn around the necks

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.974
of the soul-washers of the Asante king.

00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:29.529
What was their job? To wash the king's soul.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.434
It would take a long while

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:33.661
to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing

00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:34.961
that could be washed,

00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:37.740
but Rattray knew that this was religion

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.243
because souls were in play.

00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:42.989
And similarly,

00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:45.196
there were many other things, many other practices.

00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:47.559
For example, every time anybody
had a drink, more or less,

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.581
they poured a little bit on the ground

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:51.310
in what's called the libation,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.999
and they gave some to the ancestors.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:55.348
My father did this. Every time
he opened a bottle of whiskey,

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:56.869
which I'm glad to say was very often,

00:10:56.869 --> 00:11:00.748
he would take the top off and
pour off just a little on the ground,

00:11:00.748 --> 00:11:02.099
and he would talk to,

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:05.639
he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:07.235
or Yao Antony, my great uncle,

00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:09.130
he would talk to them,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.353
offer them a little bit of this.

00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:14.238
And finally, there were these
huge public ceremonials.

00:11:14.238 --> 00:11:15.654
This is an early-19th-century drawing

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:16.927
by another British military officer

00:11:16.927 --> 00:11:18.977
of such a ceremonial,

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:21.105
where the king was involved,

00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:22.511
and the king's job,

00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.700
one of the large parts of his job,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.651
apart from organizing warfare and things like that,

00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:29.997
was to look after the tombs of his ancestors,

00:11:29.997 --> 00:11:31.994
and when a king died,

00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:33.508
the stool that he sat on was blackened

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:36.392
and put in the royal ancestral temple,

00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:38.521
and every 40 days,

00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:40.376
the King of Asante has to go and do cult

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:41.738
for his ancestors.

00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:43.240
That's a large part of his job,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.113
and people think that if he doesn't do it,

00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:46.844
things will fall apart.

00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:49.210
So he's a religious figure,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.535
as Rattray would have said,

00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.160
as well as a political figure.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.844
So all this would count as religion for Rattray,

00:11:57.844 --> 00:11:59.783
but my point is that when you look

00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:01.165
into the lives of those people,

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:03.910
you also find that every time they do anything,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.944
they're conscious of the ancestors.

00:12:05.944 --> 00:12:07.977
Every morning at breakfast,

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.803
you can go outside the front of the house

00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:12.899
and make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.083
outside your house,

00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:15.400
and again, you'll talk to the gods

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.426
and the high gods and the low gods

00:12:16.426 --> 00:12:18.084
and the ancestors and so on.

00:12:18.084 --> 00:12:19.620
This is not a world

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.527
in which the separation between religion and science

00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:24.101
has occurred.

00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.644
Religion has not being separated

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:26.920
from any other areas of life,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.917
and in particular,

00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:30.612
what's crucial to understand about this world

00:12:30.612 --> 00:12:32.150
is that it's a world in which the job

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.288
that science does for us

00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:36.432
is done by what Rattray is going to call religion,

00:12:36.432 --> 00:12:38.372
because if they want an explanation of something,

00:12:38.372 --> 00:12:40.200
if they want to know why the crop just failed,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.486
if they want to know why it's raining

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:43.904
or not raining, if they need rain,

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:46.428
if they want to know why

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:48.287
their grandfather has died,

00:12:48.287 --> 00:12:51.195
they are going to appeal to the very same entities,

00:12:51.195 --> 00:12:52.637
the very same language,

00:12:52.637 --> 00:12:55.253
talk to the very same gods about that.

00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:57.342
This great separation, in other words,

00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:59.273
between religion and science hasn't happened.

00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:03.598
Now, this would be a mere historical curiosity,

00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:07.050
except that in large parts of the world,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.794
this is still the truth.

00:13:09.794 --> 00:13:11.802
I had the privilege of going to a wedding

00:13:11.802 --> 00:13:13.567
the other day in northern Namibia,

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:16.412
20 miles or so south of the Angolan border

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.145
in a village of 200 people.

00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.313
These were modern people.

00:13:19.313 --> 00:13:21.204
We had with us Oona Chaplin,

00:13:21.204 --> 00:13:22.613
who some of you may have heard of,

00:13:22.613 --> 00:13:24.692
and one of the people from
this village came up to her,

00:13:24.692 --> 00:13:27.423
and said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"

00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:31.251
So these were not people who
were isolated from our world,

00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:32.780
but nevertheless, for them,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.333
the gods and the spirits are still very much there,

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:37.159
and when we were on the bus going back and forth

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:38.821
to the various parts of the [ceremony],

00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:41.398
they prayed not just in a generic way

00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:42.859
but for the safety of the journey,

00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:43.770
and they meant it,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.932
and when they said to me that my mother,

00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:48.623
the bridegroom's [grandmother],

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:51.185
was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.

00:13:51.185 --> 00:13:53.940
They meant, even though she was a dead person,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.518
they meant that she was still around.

00:13:56.518 --> 00:13:59.067
So in large parts of the world today,

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:01.229
that separation between science and religion

00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:02.910
hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.638
and as I say, these are not --

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:11.440
This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.147
These are fellow citizens of the world with you,

00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:15.956
but they come from a place in which religion

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.867
is occupying a very different role.

00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.993
So what I want you to think about
next time somebody wants

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:22.473
to make some vast generalization about religion

00:14:22.473 --> 00:14:25.214
is that maybe there isn't such a thing

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:27.845
as a religion, such a thing as religion,

00:14:27.845 --> 00:14:29.501
and that therefore what they say

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:32.314
cannot possibly be true.

00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:35.526
(Applause)
