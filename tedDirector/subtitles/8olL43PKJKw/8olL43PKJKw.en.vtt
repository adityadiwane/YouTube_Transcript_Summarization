00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.596
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.236
daughter of Annette,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.036
daughter of Olympia,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.596
daughter of Melvina,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.916
daughter of Katie, born 1878,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.700
Parish County, Louisiana.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.316
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.076
daughter of Carol,
daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.476
daughter of Sarah,
born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.516
VG: And in the tradition of our families,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.836
the great oral tradition
of almost every black church we know

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.756
honoring the culture
from which we draw so much power,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.236
we're gonna start the way our mommas
and grandmas would want us to start.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.916
TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.076
the meditation of our hearts,
be acceptable in thy sight,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.316
VG: We call the names and rituals
of our ancestors into this room today

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.796
because from them we received
a powerful blueprint for survival,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.396
strategies and tactics for healing
carried across oceans by African women,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.756
passed down to generations
of black women in America

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.116
who used those skills
to navigate institutions of slavery

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.036
and state-sponsored discrimination

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.356
in order that we might
stand on this stage.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.116
We walk in the footsteps of those women,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.436
our foremothers, legends

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.396
like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,
Fannie Lou Hamer,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.316
from whom we learned
the power of organizing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.276
after she would had
single-handedly registered

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.100
60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.156
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,
so if you can imagine

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.636
me and Vanessa inspiring
60,000 women to walk with us last year,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.140
we were fired up.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.596
But today, 100,000 black women and girls
stand on this stage with us.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.276
We are committed to healing ourselves,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.076
to lacing up our sneakers,
to walking out of our front door

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.636
every single day for total healing
and transformation in our communities,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.276
because we understand

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.796
that we are in the footsteps
of a civil rights legacy

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.916
like no other time before,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.876
and that we are facing a health crisis
like never ever before.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.916
And so we've had
a lot of moments, great moments,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.396
including the time we had on our pajamas,
we were working on our computer

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.476
and Michelle Obama emailed us
and invited us to the White House,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.876
and we thought it was spam.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.316
But this moment here is an opportunity.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.076
It is an opportunity
that we don't take for granted,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.836
and so we thought long and hard
about how we would use it.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.556
Would we talk to the women
we hope to inspire,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.316
a million in the next year,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.980
or would we talk to you?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.380
We decided to talk to you,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.860
and to talk to you about a question
that we get all the time,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.476
so that the millions of women
who hopefully will watch this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.180
will never have to answer it again.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.956
It is: Why are black women dying

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.916
faster and at higher rates

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.396
than any other group of people in America

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.660
from preventable,
obesity-related diseases?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.996
The question hurts me.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.436
I'm shaking a little bit.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.116
It feels value-laden.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.980
It hurts my body because the weight
represents so much.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.676
But we're going to talk about it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.956
and invite you into
an inside conversation today

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.180
because it is necessary,
and because we need you.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.156
VG: Each night,
before the first day of school,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.836
my grandmother
would sit me next to the stove

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.676
and with expert precision
use a hot comb to press my hair.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.196
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.156
She filled up a room with laughter
and oftentimes curse words.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.156
She cooked a mean peach cobbler,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.716
had 11 children,
a house full of grandchildren,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.196
and like every black woman I know,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.956
like most all women I know,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.316
she had prioritized the care of others
over caring for herself.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.076
We measured her strength by her capacity
to endure pain and suffering.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.956
We celebrated her for it,
and our choice would prove to be deadly.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.316
One night after pressing my hair
before the first day of eighth grade,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.156
my grandmother went to bed
and never woke up,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.516
dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.396
By the time I would graduate college,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.916
I would lose two more beloved
family members to chronic disease:

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.276
my aunt Diane, dead at 55,
my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.116
After living with these losses,
the hole that they left,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.635
I decided to calculate the life expectancy
of the women in my family.

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.540
Staring back at me, the number 65.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.716
I knew I could not sit by

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.956
and watch another woman I loved
die an early death.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.676
TMD: So we don't usually
put our business in the streets.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.156
Let's just put that out there.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.116
But I have to tell you the statistics.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.916
Black women are dying at alarming rates,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.796
and I used to be a classroom teacher,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.716
and I was at South Atlanta High School,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.076
and I remember standing
in front of my classroom,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.796
and I remember a statistic
that half of black girls will get diabetes

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.940
unless diet and levels of activity change.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.580
Half of the girls in my classroom.
So I couldn't teach anymore.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.436
So I started taking girls hiking,
which is why we're called GirlTrek,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.676
but Vanessa was like,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.876
that is not going to move the dial
on the health crisis; it's cute.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.756
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.436
So what we thought

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.620
is if we could rally
a million of their mothers ...

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.685
82 percent of black women
are over a healthy weight right now.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.420
53 percent of us are obese.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.660
But the number that I cannot,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.236
that I cannot get out of my head

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.636
is that every single day in America,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.196
137 black women

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.316
die from a preventable disease,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.556
heart disease.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.780
That's every 11 minutes.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.956
137 is more than gun violence,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.476
cigarette smoking and HIV combined,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.836
every day.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.516
It is roughly the amount of people

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.940
that were on my plane
from New Jersey to Vancouver.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.676
Can you imagine that?

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.156
A plane filled with black women
crashing to the ground every day,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.660
and no one is talking about it.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.756
VG: So the question that you're all
asking yourselves right now is why?

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.876
Why are black women dying?
We asked ourselves that same question.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.316
Why is what's out there
not working for them?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.996
Private weight loss companies,
government interventions,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.356
public health campaigns.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.836
I'm going to tell you why:

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.476
because they focus on weight loss

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.996
or looking good in skinny jeans

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.036
without acknowledging the trauma

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.956
that black women
hold in our bellies and bones,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.796
that has been embedded in our very DNA.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.156
The best advice
from hospitals and doctors,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.676
the best medications
from pharmaceutical companies

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.076
to treat the congestive heart failure
of my grandmother didn't work

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.716
because they didn't acknowledge
the systemic racism

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.476
that she had dealt with since birth.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.516
(Applause)

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.876
A divestment in schools,
discriminatory housing practices,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.956
predatory lending,
a crack cocaine epidemic,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.356
mass incarceration putting
more black bodies behind bars

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.596
than were owned at the height of slavery.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.396
But GirlTrek does.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.156
For black women whose bodies
are buckling under the weight

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.876
of systems never designed to support them,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.956
GirlTrek is a lifeline.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.556
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,
a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.836
received the news that too many
black mothers have received.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.236
Her son Norman, 23 years old,
a father of two,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.740
was gunned down
while on an afternoon drive.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.956
Imagine the grief

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.396
that overcomes your body in that moment,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.140
the immobilizing fear.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.236
Now, know this, that just days
after laying her son to rest,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.996
Danita Kimball posted online,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.756
"I don't know what to do
or how to move forward,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.796
but my sisters keep telling me
I need to walk, so I will."

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.356
And then just days after that,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.636
"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.060
It felt good to be out there, to walk."

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.836
TMD: Walking through pain
is what we have always done.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.140
My mom, she's in the middle right there,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.396
my mom desegregated
her high school in 1955.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.156
Her mom walked down the steps
of an abandoned school bus

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.076
where she raised 11 kids
as a sharecropper.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.276
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.340
fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.956
And her mom walked her man to the door

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.660
as he went off to fight
in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.660
the Civil War.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.596
They were born slaves
but they wouldn't die slaves.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.516
Change-making, it's in my blood.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.796
It's what I do,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.380
and this health crisis ain't nothing
compared to the road we have traveled.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.380
(Applause)

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.156
So it's like James Cleveland.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.716
I don't feel no ways tired,
so we got to work.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.796
We started looking at models of change.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.236
We looked all over the world.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.476
We needed something

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.636
not only that was a part
of our cultural inheritance like walking,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.715
but something that was scalable,
something that was high-impact,

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.316
something that we could replicate
across this country.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.756
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.396
for inspiring women
to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.596
She brought Kenya back from the brink
of environmental devastation.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.996
We studied these systems of change,
and we looked at walking scientifically.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.076
And what we learned
is that walking just 30 minutes a day

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.356
can single-handedly decrease
50 percent of your risk of diabetes,

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.820
heart disease, stroke,
even Alzheimer's and dementia.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.436
We know that walking
is the single most powerful thing

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.596
that a woman can do for her health,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.396
so we knew we were on to something,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.036
because from Harriet Tubman
to the women in Montgomery,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.876
when black women walk, things change.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.916
(Applause)

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.476
VG: So how did we take
this simple idea of walking

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.676
and start a revolution
that would catch a fire

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.636
in neighborhoods across America?

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.556
We used the best practices
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.236
We huddled up in church basements.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.156
We did grapevine information sharing
through beauty salons.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.076
We empowered and trained mothers
to stand on the front lines.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.596
We took our message
directly to the streets,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.036
and women responded.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.396
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.636
Chrysantha in Detroit,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.196
Onika in New Orleans,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.156
women with difficult names
and difficult stories

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.076
join GirlTrek every day and commit
to walking as a practice of self-care.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.556
Once walking, those women
get to organizing,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.716
first their families,
then their communities,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.556
to walk and talk
and solve problems together.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.676
They walk and notice
the abandoned building.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.716
They walk and notice
the lack of sidewalks,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.996
the lack of green space,

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.276
and they say, "No more."

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.196
Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.716
who after walking daily past
an abandoned building in her neighborhood,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.196
decided, "I'm not waiting.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.556
Let me rally my team.
Let me grab some supplies.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.940
Let me do what no one else has done
for me and my community."

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.676
TMD: We know one woman
can make a difference,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.956
because one woman
has already changed the world,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.516
and her name is Harriet Tubman.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.916
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.676
I'm obsessed with her,
and I used to be a history teacher.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.556
I will not tell you the whole history.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.956
I will tell you four things.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.996
So I used to have an old Saab --

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.996
the kind of canvas top that drips
on your head when it rains --

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.925
and I drove all the way down
to the eastern shore of Maryland,

00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:57.396
and when I stepped on the dirt

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.356
that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.476
I knew she was a woman just like we are

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.396
and that we could do what she had done,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.716
and we learned four things
from Harriet Tubman.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.516
The first one: do not wait.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.036
Walk right now in the direction
of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.796
because self-care is a revolutionary act.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.156
Number two:

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.396
when you learn the way forward,
come back and get a sister.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.756
So in our case,
start a team with your friends --

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.676
your friends, your family, your church.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.316
Number three:

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.780
rally your allies.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.676
Every single person in this room

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.796
is complicit in
a Tubman-inspired takeover.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.676
And number four:

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.980
find joy.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.996
The most underreported
fact of Harriet Tubman

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.556
is that she lived to be 93 years old,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.916
and she didn't live
just an ordinary life; uh-uh.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.036
She was standing up for the good guys.
She married a younger man.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.276
She adopted a child.
I'm not kidding. She lived.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.116
And I drove up to her house
of freedom in upstate New York,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.036
and she had planted apple trees,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.716
and when I was there on a Sunday,
they were blooming.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.316
Do you call it -- do they bloom?

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.036
The apples were in season,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.620
and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.740
the legacy of Harriet Tubman,
every single year.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.196
And we know that we are Harriet,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.700
and we know that there is a Harriet
in every community in America.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.036
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet
in every community across the globe,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.836
and that they could learn
from our Tubman Doctrine,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.316
as we call it, the four steps.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.036
Imagine the possibilities

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.756
beyond the neighborhoods
of Oakland and Newark,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.916
to the women working
rice fields in Vietnam,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.516
tea fields in Sri Lanka,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.876
the women on the
mountainsides in Guatemala,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.716
the indigenous reservations
throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.276
We believe that women walking

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.716
and talking together
to solve their problems

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.340
is a global solution.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.036
TMD: And I'll leave you with this,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.716
because we also believe it can become
the center of social justice again.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.596
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.036
We had an organizer training,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.676
and I was leaving
and I got on the airplane,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.516
and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.196
and as I'm waiting in that long line
that you guys know,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.236
waiting for people
to put their stuff away,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.956
I looked back and I realized I didn't
know the woman but I recognized her.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.756
And so I blew her a kiss
because it was Sybrina Fulton,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.996
Trayvon Martin's mom,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.260
and she whispered "thank you" back to me.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.316
And I can't help but wonder
what would happen

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.196
if there were groups of women
walking on Trayvon's block that day,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.356
or what would happen
in the South Side of Chicago every day

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.036
if there were groups of women
and mothers and aunts and cousins

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.276
walking,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.020
or along the polluted rivers
of Flint, Michigan.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.836
I believe that walking
can transform our communities,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.460
because it's already starting to.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.556
VG: We believe that
the personal is political.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.356
Our walking is for healing,
for joy, for fresh air,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.620
quiet time, to connect
and disconnect, to worship.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.276
But it's also walking
so we can be healthy enough

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.436
to stand on the front lines
for change in our communities,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.116
and it is our call to action
to every black woman listening,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.436
every black woman in earshot of our voice,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.996
every black woman who you know.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.196
Think about it: the woman working
front desk reception at your job,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.596
the woman who delivers
your mail, your neighbor --

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.076
our call to action to them,
to join us on the front lines

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.860
for change in your community.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.796
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.996
and why it's so important
for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.996
It's because it's not always easy for us,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.100
and in fact, we have both seen
really, really dark days,

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.796
from the hate speech to the summer
of police brutality and violence

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.220
that we saw last year,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.796
to even losing one of our walkers,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.020
Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.236
But the most courageous thing
we do every day is we practice faith

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.596
that goes beyond the facts,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.436
and we put feet to our prayers
every single day,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.116
and when we get overwhelmed,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.516
we think of the words of people
like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.916
who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.556
Where is the fire that burned
holes through slave ships

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.796
to make us breathe?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.156
Where is the fire
that turned guts into chitlins,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.956
that took rhythms and make jazz,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.636
that took sit-ins and marches
and made us jump boundaries and barriers?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.316
You've got to find it and pass it on."

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.716
So this is us finding our fire
and passing it on to you.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.076
So please, stand with us,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.716
walk with us as we rally a million women

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.636
to reclaim the streets
of the 50 highest need communities

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.036
in this country.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.436
We thank you so much for this opportunity.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.380
(Applause)
