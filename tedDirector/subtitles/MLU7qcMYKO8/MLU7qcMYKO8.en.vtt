00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
in 18 minutes.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
That's 300 million years per minute.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
of planet Mars.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
This is fly-by, Mariner IV.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It was taken in 1965.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
When this picture appeared,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that well-known scientific journal,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
"Mars is uninteresting.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
any time or effort studying Mars anymore."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
at NASA headquarters knew better

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and we began a very extensive study

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
of the red planet.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
One of the key questions in all of science,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
"Is there life outside of Earth?"

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.260
I believe that Mars is the most likely target

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
for life outside the Earth.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I'm going to show you in a few minutes

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
some amazing measurements that suggest

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
there may be life on Mars.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
But let me start with a Viking photograph.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Viking was developed and managed at the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
NASA Langley Research Center.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
two on the surface --

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
an amazing accomplishment.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
This is the first photograph taken from

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
the surface of any planet.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
This is a Viking Lander photograph

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
of the surface of Mars.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And yes, the red planet is red.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Mars is half the size of the Earth,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
the land area on Mars

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
is comparable to the land area on Earth.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
We have obtained topographic measurements

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
of the surface of Mars. We understand

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
the elevation differences.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We know a lot about Mars.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Olympus Mons.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Mars has the Grand Canyon

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
of the solar system, Valles Marineris.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Very, very interesting planet.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Mars has the largest

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
impact crater in the solar system,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Hellas Basin.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This is 2,000 miles across.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
If you happened to be on Mars

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
when this impactor hit,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
it was a really bad day on Mars.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
(Laughter)

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
This is Olympus Mons.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
This is bigger than the state of Arizona.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
We're looking at Valles Marineris,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
the largest canyon in the solar system,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
superimposed on a map of the United States,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
3,000 miles across.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
One of the most intriguing features about Mars,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
the National Academy of Science says

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
is why certain areas of Mars

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
are so highly magnetized.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
We call this crustal magnetism.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
we don't understand why at this point --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
the surface is very, very highly magnetized.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Is there water on Mars?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
The answer is no, there is no liquid water

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
on the surface of Mars today.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
But there is intriguing evidence

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that suggests that the early history of Mars

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
there may have been rivers

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and fast flowing water.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Today Mars is very very dry.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
We believe there's some water in the polar caps,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Here are some recent images.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
This is from Spirit and Opportunity.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
These images that show at one time,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.260
there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Why is water important? Water is important

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
because if you want life you have to have water.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Water is the key ingredient

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.260
in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Here is some picture of Antarctica

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
and a picture of Olympus Mons,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
very similar features, glaciers.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So, this is frozen water.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
This is ice water on Mars.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It has not been seen publicly.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
This is European space agency

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and in the middle of the crater

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
we have liquid water, we have ice.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Very intriguing photograph.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.260
We now believe that in the early history of Mars,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
which is 4.6 billion years ago,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.260
4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.260
but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.260
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and this area in blue,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
which shows a depression of about four miles,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
was the ancient ocean area

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
on the surface of Mars.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Well, we have an idea.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.260
from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Sub-surface water on Mars,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
frozen in the form of ice.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
it means 16 percent by weight.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
contains frozen water, or ice.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So, there is a lot of water below the surface.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
was released earlier this year

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
in the magazine Science.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Why is methane important?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Because on Earth, almost all --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
99.9 percent -- of the methane

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
is produced by living systems,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.260
not little green men, but microscopic life

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
below the surface or at the surface.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
We now have evidence

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
a gas that, on Earth,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
is biogenic in origin,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
produced by living systems.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And this is the terrain it appears over,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and we know from geological studies

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
In fact, the Earth and Mars

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.260
are both 4.6 billion years old.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
The reason there is a billion-year gap

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
in our geological understanding

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
is because of plate tectonics,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The crust of the Earth has been recycled.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
We have no geological record prior

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
for the first billion years.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
That record exists on Mars.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And this terrain that we're looking at

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.260
dates back to 4.6 billion years

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
when Earth and Mars were formed.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
It was a Tuesday.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
(Laughter)

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
This is a map that shows

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.260
where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Here is Viking I, Viking II.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
we just put two years ago.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
have gone to the northern hemisphere.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
That's because the northern hemisphere

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
is the region of the ancient

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
ocean basin.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
There aren't many craters.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And that's because the water protected the basin

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.260
from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
But look in the southern hemisphere.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
there are volcanic craters.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Here's Hellas Basin,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
a very very different place, geologically.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.260
rough terrain area.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
What is the best way to unravel

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
the mysteries on Mars that exist?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.260
We asked this question 10 years ago.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to the Langley Research Center for two days.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
We addressed on the board

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
the major questions that have not been answered.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And we spent two days deciding

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
how to best answer this question.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And the result of our meeting

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.260
was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.260
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
There's a model of ARES here.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
This is a 20-percent scale model.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.260
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
If any place in the world

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
can build an airplane to fly on Mars,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
it's the Langley Research Center,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
for almost 100 years

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
a leading center of aeronautics in the world.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
We fly about a mile above the surface.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
We cover hundreds of miles,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and we fly about 450 miles an hour.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
We can do things that rovers can't do

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
and landers can't do:

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
we fly over valleys;

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
we can fly over surface magnetism,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
the polar caps, subsurface water;

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
and we can search for life on Mars.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
But, of equal importance,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
we transmit that journey,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
we transmit those images back to Earth.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And our goal is to inspire the American public

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
But more important we will

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
inspire the next generation of scientists,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
technologists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.260
And that's a critical area of national security

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and economic vitality, to make sure

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
we produce the next generation

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
This is what ARES looks like

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
as it flies over Mars.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
We preprogram it.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
We will fly where the methane is.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
We will have instruments aboard the plane

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
We will look for methane

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
as well as other gasses

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
produced by living systems.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.260
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
and there, we can direct the next mission

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
to land right in that area.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
How do we transport an airplane to Mars?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
In two words, very carefully.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
we put it in a spacecraft

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and we send it to Mars.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
The problem is the spacecraft's

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.260
largest diameter is nine feet;

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.260
ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
How do we get it to Mars?

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
We fold it,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and we transport it in a spacecraft.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
This is how we do it.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And we have a little video that describes the sequence.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Main engine start, and liftoff.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
This is the spacecraft taking nine months

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
to get to Mars.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
It enters the atmosphere of Mars.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
A lot of heating,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
A parachute opens up to slow it down.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
The thermal tiles fall off.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
It unfolds.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
The rocket engine begins.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
We believe that in a one-hour flight

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
we can rewrite the textbook on Mars

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
looking for gases of biogenic origin,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
looking for gases of volcanic origin,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
studying the surface, studying the magnetism

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
on the surface, which we don't understand,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
as well as about a dozen other areas.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Practice makes perfect.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
How do we know we can do it?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Because we have tested ARES model,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
under Mars conditions.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And, of equal importance

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.260
is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
at 100,000 feet,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
which is comparable to the density and pressure

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
you fly 37,000 feet.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
We do our tests at 100,000 feet.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And I want to show you one of our tests.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
This is a half-scale model.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.260
We put the folded airplane on the balloon --

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
it took about three hours to get up there --

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and then we released it on command

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
at 103,000 feet,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.260
and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And we've done

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
high-altitude and low-altitude tests,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.260
just to perfect this technique.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
We're ready to go.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
I have a scale model here.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
But we have a full-scale model

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.260
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
(Laughter)

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
to cover the costs.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
for this mission.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.260
There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
This is the ARES team;

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.260
we have about 150 scientists, engineers;

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and corporations in developing this.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:28.260
It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
And let me conclude by saying

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
not too far from here,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
a little more than 100 years ago

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
history was made

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
We are on the verge right now

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
to make the first flight of an airplane

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
We are prepared to fly this on Mars,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
rewrite the textbook about Mars.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
If you're interested in more information,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
we have a website that describes this exciting

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Thank you very much.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
(Applause)
