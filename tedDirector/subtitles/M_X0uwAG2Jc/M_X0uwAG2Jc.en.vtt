00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.536
As a lover of human anatomy,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.576
I'm so excited that we're finally
putting our bodies at the center of focus.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.176
Through practices
such as preventive medicine,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.656
patient empowerment

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.256
and self-monitoring --

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.816
down to now obsessing
over every single step we take in a day.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.456
All of this works to promote

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.240
a healthy connection
between ourselves and our bodies.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.016
Despite all this focus
on the healthy self,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.880
general public knowledge
of the anatomical self is lacking.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.515
Many people don't know
the location of their vital organs,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.296
or even how they function.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.776
And that's because human anatomy

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000
is a difficult and time-intensive
subject to learn.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840
How many of you here
made it through anatomy?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.096
Wow, good --

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.480
most of you are in medicine.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.240
I, like you, spent countless hours
memorizing hundreds of structures.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.440
Something no student of anatomy
could do without the help of visuals.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.936
Because at the end of the day,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.616
whether you remember
every little structure or not,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.216
these medical illustrations are what
makes studying anatomy so intriguing.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.696
In looking at them,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.960
we're actually viewing
a manual of our very selves.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280
But what happens when we're done studying?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.976
These beautiful illustrations
are then shut back

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
into the pages of a medical textbook,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.216
or an app,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.600
referenced only when needed.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.656
And for the public,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.536
medical illustrations
may only be encountered passively

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.200
on the walls of a doctor's office.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.416
From the beginnings of modern medicine,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.736
medical illustration,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.336
and therefore anatomy,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.240
have existed primarily within
the realm of medical education.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.496
Yet there's something fascinating
happening right now.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.016
Artists are breaking anatomy
out of the confines of the medical world

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240
and are thrusting it
into the public space.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.776
For the past nine years,
I have been cataloguing and sharing

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.296
this rise in anatomical art
with the public --

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.120
all from my perspective
as a medical illustrator.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.816
But before I get into showing you
how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.200
it's important to understand
how art influenced anatomy in the past.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.976
Now, anatomy is by its
very nature a visual science,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.680
and the first anatomists to understand
this lived during the Renaissance.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.336
They relied on artists

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.840
to help advertise their discoveries
to their peers in the public.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.200
And this drive to not only teach
but also to entertain

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.480
resulted in some of the strangest
anatomical illustrations.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.136
Anatomy was caught in a struggle
between science, art and culture

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.960
that lasted for over 500 years.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.856
Artists rendered
dissected cadavers as alive,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.560
posed in these humorous
anatomical stripteases.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.400
Imagine seeing that
in your textbooks today.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.720
They also showed them as very much dead --

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.680
unwillingly stripped of their skin.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.560
Disembodied limbs were often
posed in literal still lives.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.656
And some illustrations
even included pop culture references.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.976
This is Clara,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.336
a famous rhinoceros that was
traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.376
at a time when seeing a rhino
was an exciting rarity.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.080
Including her in this illustration
was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.160
The introduction of color

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.136
then brought a whole new
depth and clarity to anatomy

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520
that made it stunning.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.776
By the early 20th century,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.256
the perfect balance of science
and art had finally been struck

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.096
with the emergence
of medical illustrators.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.976
They created a universal
representation of anatomy --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.856
something that was neither alive nor dead,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.240
that was free from those influences
of artistic culture.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.896
And this focus on no-frills accuracy

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.536
was precisely for the benefit
of medical education.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.160
And this is what we
get to study from today.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.896
But why is it that medical illustration --

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.495
both past and present --

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:32.079
captures our imaginations?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.040
Now, we are innately tuned
into the beauty of the human body.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.960
And medical illustration is still art.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.856
Nothing can elicit
an emotional response --

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.456
from joy to complete disgust --

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.720
more than the human body.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.616
And today,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.016
artists armed with that emotion,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.736
are grasping anatomy
from the medical world,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.880
and are reinvigorating it through art
in the most imaginative ways.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.016
A perfect example of this is Spanish
contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.200
He takes 19th century anatomical
illustrations of the male body

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.840
and envelops them in a female sensuality.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.456
The women in his paintings taunt us
to view beyond their surface anatomy,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.416
thereby introducing a strong femininity

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.320
that was previously lacking in the history
of anatomical representation.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.216
Artistry can also be seen in the repair
and recovery of the human body.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.376
This is an X-ray of a woman
who fractured and dislocated her ankle

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.800
in a roller-skating accident.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.696
As a tribute to her trauma,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.416
she commissioned Montreal-based
architect Federico Carbajal

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.240
to construct a wire sculpture
of her damaged lower leg.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.560
Now, notice those bright red screws
magnified in the sculpture.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.920
These are the actual surgical screws
used in reconstructing her ankle.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.000
It's medical hardware
that's been repurposed as art.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.456
People often ask me how I choose
the art that I showcase online

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.416
or feature in gallery shows.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.096
And for me it's a balance
between the technique

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.856
and a concept that pushes the boundaries
of anatomy as a way to know thyself,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.200
which is why the work
of Michael Reedy struck me.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.576
His serious figure drawings
are often layered in elements of humor.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.680
For instance, take a look at her face.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.240
Notice those red marks.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.496
Michael manifests the consuming
insecurity of a skin condition

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.496
as these maniacal cartoon monsters

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.680
annoying and out of control
in the background.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.880
On the mirrored figure,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.776
he renders the full anatomy

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.936
and covers it in glitter,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.320
making it look like candy.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.856
By doing this,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.256
Michael downplays
the common perception of anatomy

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.760
so closely tied to just disease and death.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.616
Now, this next concept
might not make much sense,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.560
but human anatomy
is no longer limited to humans.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.656
When you were a child,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.136
did you ever wish
that your toys could come to life?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.376
Well, Jason Freeny
makes those dreams come true

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.016
with his magical toy dissections.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.360
(Laughter)

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.056
One might think that this
would bring a morbid edge

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.536
to one's innocent childhood characters,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.056
but Jason says of his dissections,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.560
"One thing I've never seen
in a child's reaction to my work is fear."

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.176
It's always wonder,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.576
amazement

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.920
and wanting to explore.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.200
Fear of anatomy and guts
is a learned reaction.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.440
This anatomization also extends to
politically and socially charged objects.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.456
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.040
we see a gun dissected
to reveal human organs.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.896
But if you look closely,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.680
you'll notice that it lacks a brain.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.136
And if you keep looking,
you might also notice

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.256
that Noah has so thoughtfully
placed the rectum

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.160
at the business end of that gun barrel.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.856
Now, this next artist
I've been following for many years,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.200
watching him excite
the public about anatomy.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.216
Danny Quirk is a young artist

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.520
who paints his subjects
in the process of self-dissection.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.616
He bends the rules of medical illustration

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.040
by inserting a very dramatic
light and shadow.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.176
And this creates a 3-D illusion

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.320
that lends itself very well
to painting directly on the human skin.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.360
Danny makes it look as if a person's
skin has actually been removed.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.775
And this effect --

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:50.000
also cool and tattoo-like --

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.799
easily transitions
into a medical illustration.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.296
Now Danny is currently
traveling the world,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.336
teaching anatomy to the public
via his body paintings,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.416
which is why it was
so shocking to find out

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.160
that he was rejected
from medical illustration programs.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.920
But he's doing just fine.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.736
Then there are artists

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.536
who are extracting anatomy from both
the medical world and the art world

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.640
and are placing it
directly on the streets.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.320
London-based SHOK-1 paints
giant X-rays of pop culture icons.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.456
His X-rays show how culture
can come to have an anatomy of its own,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.320
and conversely how culture can become
part of the anatomy of a person.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.336
You come to admire his work

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.416
because reproducing X-rays by hand,
let alone with spray paint,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.496
is extremely difficult.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.416
But then again this is a street artist,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.920
who also happens to hold
a degree in applied chemistry.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.616
Nychos, an Austrian street artist,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.736
takes the term "exploded view"
to a whole new level,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.440
splattering human and animal dissections
on walls all over the world.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.296
Influenced by comics and heavy metal,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.136
Nychos inserts a very youthful
and enticing energy into anatomy

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.400
that I just love.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.776
Street artists believe
that art belongs to the public.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.656
And this street anatomy is so captivating

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.400
because it is the furthest removed
from the medical world.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.536
It forces you to look at it,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.800
and confront your own
perceptions about anatomy,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.656
whether you find it beautiful,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.896
gross,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.136
morbid

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
or awe-inspiring, like I do.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.856
That it elicits these responses at all

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.440
is due to our intimate
and often changing relationship with it.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.336
All of the artists
that I showed you here today

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.016
referenced medical
illustrations for their art.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.256
But for them,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.976
anatomy isn't just something to memorize,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.160
but a base from which to understand
the human body on a meaningful level;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.456
to depict it in ways that we can relate,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.816
whether it be through cartoons,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.056
body painting

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.280
or street art.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.056
Anatomical art has the power

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.096
to reach far beyond
the pages of a medical textbook,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.296
to ignite an excitement in the public,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.760
and reinvigorate an enthusiasm
in the medical world,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.680
ultimately connecting our innermost selves
with our bodies through art.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.096
Thank you.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.200
(Applause)
