00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.358
I know this is going to sound strange,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:20.365
but I think robots can inspire us
to be better humans.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.339
See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:26.301
the home of Bethlehem Steel.

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.103
My father was an engineer,

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:33.446
and when I was growing up,
he would teach me how things worked.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.564
We would build projects together,

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:38.356
like model rockets and slot cars.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:41.640
Here's the go-kart that we built together.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.952
That's me behind the wheel,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.200
with my sister and my best
friend at the time.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.801
And one day,

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.908
he came home, when I was
about 10 years old,

00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:55.558
and at the dinner table, he announced

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:59.294
that for our next project, 
we were going to build ...

00:00:59.318 --> 00:01:00.468
a robot.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:02.759
A robot.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.183
Now, I was thrilled about this,

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:09.009
because at school,
there was a bully named Kevin,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:10.922
and he was picking on me,

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.336
because I was the only
Jewish kid in class.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.283
So I couldn't wait to get
started to work on this,

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:18.917
so I could introduce Kevin to my robot.

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:19.971
(Laughter)

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:24.238
(Robot noises)

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.944
(Laughter)

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:34.817
But that wasn't the kind of robot
my dad had in mind.

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:35.909
(Laughter)

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.565
See, he owned a chromium-plating company,

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:45.462
and they had to move heavy steel parts
between tanks of chemicals.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:48.859
And so he needed
an industrial robot like this,

00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:50.986
that could basically do the heavy lifting.

00:01:51.684 --> 00:01:55.275
But my dad didn't get
the kind of robot he wanted, either.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.300
He and I worked on it for several years,

00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:03.069
but it was the 1970s, and the technology
that was available to amateurs

00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:04.419
just wasn't there yet.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.777
So Dad continued to do
this kind of work by hand.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.023
And a few years later,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.306
he was diagnosed with cancer.

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:17.392
You see,

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.012
what the robot we were trying
to build was telling him

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.192
was not about doing the heavy lifting.

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:23.367
It was a warning

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:25.895
about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:29.477
He didn't recognize that at the time,

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:31.187
and he contracted leukemia.

00:02:31.827 --> 00:02:33.719
And he died at the age of 45.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.130
I was devastated by this.

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:40.465
And I never forgot the robot
that he and I tried to build.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:45.748
When I was at college, I decided
to study engineering, like him.

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:51.629
And I went to Carnegie Mellon,
and I earned my PhD in robotics.

00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:53.562
I've been studying robots ever since.

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.316
So what I'd like to tell you about
are four robot projects,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.389
and how they've inspired me
to be a better human.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:11.820
By 1993, I was a young professor at USC,

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:14.662
and I was just building up
my own robotics lab,

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:17.907
and this was the year
the World Wide Web came out.

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:21.472
And I remember my students
were the ones who told me about it,

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:23.813
and we would -- we were just amazed.

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:27.220
We started playing with this,
and that afternoon,

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:31.522
we realized that we could use
this new, universal interface

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:35.974
to allow anyone in the world
to operate the robot in our lab.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.381
So, rather than have it fight
or do industrial work,

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.943
we decided to build a planter,

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:46.918
put the robot into the center of it,

00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:48.620
and we called it the Telegarden.

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:54.253
And we had put a camera
in the gripper of the hand of the robot,

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:57.208
and we wrote some
special scripts and software,

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:59.266
so that anyone in the world could come in,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.074
and by clicking on the screen,

00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:04.719
they could move the robot around
and visit the garden.

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:09.267
But we also set up some other software

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:13.207
that lets you participate
and help us water the garden, remotely.

00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:15.932
And if you watered it a few times,

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:18.231
we'd give you your own seed to plant.

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:22.643
Now, this was an engineering project,

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:26.779
and we published some papers
on the system design of it,

00:04:26.803 --> 00:04:29.448
but we also thought of it
as an art installation.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.787
It was invited, after the first year,

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:35.831
by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:38.677
to have it installed in their lobby.

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:43.545
And I'm happy to say, it remained
online there, 24 hours a day,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.400
for almost nine years.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:50.144
That robot was operated by more people

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:52.065
than any other robot in history.

00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:54.930
Now, one day,

00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:58.302
I got a call out of the blue
from a student,

00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:03.369
who asked a very simple
but profound question.

00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.187
He said, "Is the robot real?"

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.885
Now, everyone else had assumed it was,

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.425
and we knew it was,
because we were working with it.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.847
But I knew what he meant,

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.313
because it would be possible

00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:19.122
to take a bunch of pictures
of flowers in a garden

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:22.785
and then, basically, index them
in a computer system,

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.436
such that it would appear
that there was a real robot,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.610
when there wasn't.

00:05:27.088 --> 00:05:28.612
And the more I thought about it,

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:32.215
I couldn't think of a good answer
for how he could tell the difference.

00:05:32.628 --> 00:05:35.425
This was right about the time
that I was offered a position

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.750
here at Berkeley.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:38.419
And when I got here,

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:40.805
I looked up Hubert Dreyfus,

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.756
who's a world-renowned
professor of philosophy,

00:05:44.582 --> 00:05:47.312
And I talked with him
about this and he said,

00:05:47.336 --> 00:05:51.438
"This is one of the oldest
and most central problems in philosophy.

00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:55.479
It goes back to the Skeptics
and up through Descartes.

00:05:55.503 --> 00:05:58.685
It's the issue of epistemology,

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:01.577
the study of how do we know
that something is true."

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.625
So he and I started working together,

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:07.520
and we coined a new term:
"telepistemology,"

00:06:08.757 --> 00:06:10.893
the study of knowledge at a distance.

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:15.794
We invited leading artists,
engineers and philosophers

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:17.137
to write essays about this,

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:20.865
and the results are collected
in this book from MIT Press.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.055
So thanks to this student,

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.398
who questioned what everyone else
had assumed to be true,

00:06:27.422 --> 00:06:31.399
this project taught me
an important lesson about life,

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:34.410
which is to always question assumptions.

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:37.983
Now, the second project
I'll tell you about

00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:39.999
grew out of the Telegarden.

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:42.844
As it was operating, my students
and I were very interested

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:45.209
in how people were interacting
with each other,

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:47.290
and what they were doing with the garden.

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:48.465
So we started thinking:

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.457
what if the robot could leave the garden

00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.295
and go out into some other
interesting environment?

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.060
Like, for example,
what if it could go to a dinner party

00:06:56.084 --> 00:06:57.545
at the White House?

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.068
(Laughter)

00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:03.970
So, because we were interested
more in the system design

00:07:03.994 --> 00:07:06.937
and the user interface
than in the hardware,

00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:08.112
we decided that,

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:12.623
rather than have a robot replace
the human to go to the party,

00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:14.877
we'd have a human replace the robot.

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:17.139
We called it the Tele-Actor.

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:19.986
We got a human,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.118
someone who's very
outgoing and gregarious,

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:27.397
and she was outfitted with a helmet
with various equipment,

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:28.705
cameras and microphones,

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.794
and then a backpack with wireless
Internet connection.

00:07:32.882 --> 00:07:35.026
And the idea was that she could go

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.500
into a remote and interesting environment,

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.541
and then over the Internet,

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:42.157
people could experience
what she was experiencing.

00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:45.707
So they could see what she was seeing,

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.014
but then, more importantly,
they could participate,

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:53.788
by interacting with each other
and coming up with ideas

00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:57.781
about what she should do next
and where she should go,

00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.011
and then conveying those
to the Tele-Actor.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:03.490
So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor

00:08:03.514 --> 00:08:06.322
to the Webby Awards in San Francisco.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.369
And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.980
Just before the curtain went
up, I had about 30 seconds

00:08:15.004 --> 00:08:18.746
to explain to Mr. Donaldson
what we were going to do.

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:23.636
And I said, "The Tele-Actor
is going to be joining you onstage.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.014
This is a new experimental project,

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.633
and people are watching her
on their screens,

00:08:28.657 --> 00:08:31.948
there's cameras involved
and there's microphones

00:08:31.972 --> 00:08:33.758
and she's got an earbud in her ear,

00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:36.099
and people over the network
are giving her advice

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:37.281
about what to do next."

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:38.700
And he said, "Wait a second.

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:40.979
That's what I do."

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:45.980
(Laughter)

00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:47.876
So he loved the concept,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.153
and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,
she walked right up to him,

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:54.636
and she gave him a big kiss
right on the lips.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.612
(Laughter)

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.558
We were totally surprised --
we had no idea that would happen.

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:02.200
And he was great, he just gave her
a big hug in return,

00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:03.881
and it worked out great.

00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:05.945
But that night, as we were packing up,

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:10.524
I asked the Tele-Actor,
how did the Tele-Directors decide

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:13.548
that they would give
a kiss to Sam Donaldson?

00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:16.592
And she said they hadn't.

00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:19.892
She said, when she was
just about to walk onstage,

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:22.890
the Tele-Directors still were trying
to agree on what to do,

00:09:22.914 --> 00:09:26.014
and so she just walked onstage
and did what felt most natural.

00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:30.552
(Laughter)

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:33.668
So, the success
of the Tele-Actor that night

00:09:33.692 --> 00:09:37.945
was due to the fact
that she was a wonderful actor.

00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:40.398
She knew when to trust her instincts.

00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:44.351
And so that project taught me
another lesson about life,

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:48.022
which is that, when in doubt, improvise.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.712
(Laughter)

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:55.583
Now, the third project
grew out of my experience

00:09:55.607 --> 00:09:57.456
when my father was in the hospital.

00:09:59.284 --> 00:10:02.637
He was undergoing a treatment --
chemotherapy treatments --

00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:06.931
and there's a related treatment
called brachytherapy,

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:10.743
where tiny, radioactive seeds
are placed into the body

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:12.501
to treat cancerous tumors.

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:15.843
And the way it's done,
as you can see here,

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:20.234
is that surgeons
insert needles into the body

00:10:20.258 --> 00:10:21.573
to deliver the seeds.

00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:25.672
And all these needles
are inserted in parallel.

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:31.838
So it's very common that some
of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.

00:10:32.635 --> 00:10:39.608
And as a result, the needles damage
these organs, cause damage,

00:10:39.632 --> 00:10:42.041
which leads to trauma and side effects.

00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.225
So my students and I wondered:

00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:48.771
what if we could modify the system,

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:51.420
so that the needles
could come in at different angles?

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:54.238
So we simulated this;

00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:57.707
we developed some optimization
algorithms and we simulated this.

00:10:57.731 --> 00:10:58.882
And we were able to show

00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:01.468
that we are able to avoid
the delicate organs,

00:11:01.492 --> 00:11:06.545
and yet still achieve the coverage
of the tumors with the radiation.

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.787
So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF

00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:13.078
and engineers at Johns Hopkins,

00:11:13.102 --> 00:11:17.064
and we're building a robot
that has a number of --

00:11:17.088 --> 00:11:19.687
it's a specialized design
with different joints

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:24.034
that can allow the needles to come in
at an infinite variety of angles.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:28.205
And as you can see here,
they can avoid delicate organs

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.893
and still reach the targets
they're aiming for.

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:37.004
So, by questioning this assumption
that all the needles have to be parallel,

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.654
this project also taught me
an important lesson:

00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:44.869
When in doubt, when your path
is blocked, pivot.

00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:49.637
And the last project
also has to do with medical robotics.

00:11:50.187 --> 00:11:53.757
And this is something
that's grown out of a system

00:11:53.781 --> 00:11:57.129
called the da Vinci surgical robot.

00:11:57.866 --> 00:12:00.310
And this is a commercially
available device.

00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:03.307
It's being used in over 2,000
hospitals around the world.

00:12:04.013 --> 00:12:08.386
The idea is it allows the surgeon
to operate comfortably

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.187
in his own coordinate frame.

00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:18.531
Many of the subtasks in surgery are very
routine and tedious, like suturing,

00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:20.822
and currently, all of these are performed

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:24.713
under the specific and immediate
control of the surgeon.

00:12:25.374 --> 00:12:27.642
So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:29.522
And we've been wondering,

00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:33.917
what if we could program the robot
to perform some of these subtasks,

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.322
and thereby free the surgeon

00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:38.581
to focus on the more complicated
parts of the surgery,

00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:41.405
and also cut down on the time
that the surgery would take

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:44.268
if we could get the robot
to do them a little bit faster?

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.380
Now, it's hard to program a robot
to do delicate things like this.

00:12:48.943 --> 00:12:53.149
But it turns out my colleague
Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:58.653
has developed a new set of techniques
for teaching robots from example.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.913
So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,

00:13:01.937 --> 00:13:05.191
do incredibly interesting,
beautiful acrobatics,

00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:07.182
by watching human experts fly them.

00:13:08.152 --> 00:13:10.058
So we got one of these robots.

00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:12.622
We started working with Pieter
and his students.

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:16.826
And we asked a surgeon
to perform a task --

00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:19.912
with the robot.

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:22.961
So what we're doing is asking
the surgeon to perform the task,

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:25.021
and we record the motions of the robot.

00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:26.471
So here's an example.

00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:29.616
I'll use tracing out
a figure eight as an example.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.804
So here's what it looks like
when the robot --

00:13:33.828 --> 00:13:36.896
this is what the robot's path
looks like, those three examples.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.056
Now, those are much better
than what a novice like me could do,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.774
but they're still jerky and imprecise.

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:46.739
So we record all these examples, the data,

00:13:46.763 --> 00:13:49.624
and then go through a sequence of steps.

00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:53.404
First, we use a technique
called dynamic time warping

00:13:53.428 --> 00:13:54.918
from speech recognition.

00:13:54.942 --> 00:13:58.279
And this allows us to temporally
align all of the examples.

00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:04.120
And then we apply Kalman filtering,
a technique from control theory,

00:14:04.144 --> 00:14:07.113
that allows us to statistically
analyze all the noise

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:11.259
and extract the desired
trajectory that underlies them.

00:14:13.283 --> 00:14:15.833
Now we take those human demonstrations --

00:14:15.857 --> 00:14:17.532
they're all noisy and imperfect --

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:20.154
and we extract from them
an inferred task trajectory

00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:22.704
and control sequence for the robot.

00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:25.497
We then execute that on the robot,

00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:27.546
we observe what happens,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.927
then we adjust the controls,

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.747
using a sequence of techniques
called iterative learning.

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:36.538
Then what we do is we increase
the velocity a little bit.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:40.379
We observe the results,
adjust the controls again,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.112
and observe what happens.

00:14:43.136 --> 00:14:45.303
And we go through this several rounds.

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:46.508
And here's the result.

00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:48.706
That's the inferred task trajectory,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.951
and here's the robot
moving at the speed of the human.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.080
Here's four times the speed of the human.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.961
Here's seven times.

00:14:57.004 --> 00:15:01.829
And here's the robot operating
at 10 times the speed of the human.

00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:05.663
So we're able to get a robot
to perform a delicate task

00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:08.573
like a surgical subtask,

00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:10.962
at 10 times the speed of a human.

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:14.445
So this project also,

00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:16.994
because of its involved
practicing and learning,

00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:18.780
doing something over and over again,

00:15:18.804 --> 00:15:21.381
this project also has a lesson, which is:

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:23.809
if you want to do something well,

00:15:25.084 --> 00:15:29.524
there's no substitute
for practice, practice, practice.

00:15:33.186 --> 00:15:36.673
So these are four of the lessons
that I've learned from robots

00:15:36.697 --> 00:15:37.995
over the years.

00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:44.819
And the field of robotics
has gotten much better over time.

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:48.595
Nowadays, high school students
can build robots,

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:51.503
like the industrial robot
my dad and I tried to build.

00:15:52.675 --> 00:15:55.445
But, it's very -- now ...

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:59.255
And now, I have a daughter,

00:15:59.857 --> 00:16:01.014
named Odessa.

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:02.926
She's eight years old.

00:16:03.682 --> 00:16:05.331
And she likes robots, too.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.366
Maybe it runs in the family.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.630
(Laughter)

00:16:08.654 --> 00:16:10.749
I wish she could meet my dad.

00:16:12.303 --> 00:16:15.043
And now I get to teach her
how things work,

00:16:15.067 --> 00:16:17.297
and we get to build projects together.

00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:20.527
And I wonder what kind of lessons
she'll learn from them.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:26.154
Robots are the most human of our machines.

00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:29.937
They can't solve all
of the world's problems,

00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:33.484
but I think they have something
important to teach us.

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:36.277
I invite all of you

00:16:36.301 --> 00:16:39.879
to think about the innovations
that you're interested in,

00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:42.955
the machines that you wish for.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.267
And think about
what they might be telling you.

00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:50.956
Because I have a hunch that many
of our technological innovations,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.651
the devices we dream about,

00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:57.015
can inspire us to be better humans.

00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:59.135
Thank you.

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:01.071
(Applause)
