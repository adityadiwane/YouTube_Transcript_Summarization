00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:14.450
I'd like to talk today

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.922
about how we can change our brains

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:19.515
and our society.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.690
Meet Joe.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.408
Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.150
I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.970
at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.971
I'd like you to imagine this place.

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.069
It looks and feels like it sounds:

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.451
Wormwood Scrubs.

00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:41.675
Built at the end of the Victorian Era

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.187
by the inmates themselves,

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:46.387
it is where England's most
dangerous prisoners are kept.

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:48.593
These individuals have committed acts

00:00:48.593 --> 00:00:50.763
of unspeakable evil.

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:54.474
And I was there to study their brains.

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:56.226
I was part of a team of researchers

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:57.903
from University College London,

00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:00.658
on a grant from the U.K. department of health.

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:02.706
My task was to study a group of inmates

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:05.450
who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.175
That meant they were the most

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.888
callous and the most aggressive

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:12.012
of the entire prison population.

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:15.589
What lay at the root of their behavior?

00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:19.915
Was there a neurological cause for their condition?

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.758
And if there was a neurological cause,

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:25.813
could we find a cure?

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:29.758
So I'd like to speak about change, and 
especially about emotional change.

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:31.738
Growing up, I was always intrigued

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.802
by how people change.

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:37.325
My mother, a clinical psychotherapist,

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.965
would occasionally see patients at home

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.385
in the evening.

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:42.919
She would shut the door to the living room,

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.924
and I imagined

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:47.436
magical things happened in that room.

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:49.117
At the age of five or six

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:51.559
I would creep up in my pajamas

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:54.368
and sit outside with my ear glued to the door.

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:55.815
On more than one occasion, I fell asleep

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.275
and they had to push me out of the way

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:59.436
at the end of the session.

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:02.335
And I suppose that's how I found myself

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.410
walking into the secure interview room

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.419
on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.755
Joe sat across a steel table

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.981
and greeted me with this blank expression.

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.859
The prison warden, looking equally indifferent,

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.506
said, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.945
and we'll be around as soon as we can."

00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.903
(Laughter)

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:27.673
I sat down.

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:30.650
The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.744
I looked up at the red buzzer

00:02:32.744 --> 00:02:34.843
far behind Joe on the opposite wall.

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.489
(Laughter)

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.251
I looked at Joe.

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.328
Perhaps detecting my concern,

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.684
he leaned forward, and said,

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.911
as reassuringly as he could,

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.291
"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.544
it doesn't work anyway."

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:53.991
(Laughter)

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:57.361
Over the subsequent months,

00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.446
we tested Joe and his fellow inmates,

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:03.497
looking specifically at their ability

00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:08.481
to categorize different images of emotion.

00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:10.267
And we looked at their physical response

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.009
to those emotions.

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.590
So, for example, when most of us look

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.515
at a picture like this of somebody looking sad,

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:20.066
we instantly have a slight,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.000
measurable physical response:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.298
increased heart rate, sweating of the skin.

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:27.082
Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.096
to describe the pictures accurately,

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:32.829
they failed to show the emotions required.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.382
They failed to show a physical response.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.433
It was as though they knew the words

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:41.826
but not the music of empathy.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:43.610
So we wanted to look closer at this

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.059
to use MRI to image their brains.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.166
That turned out to be not such an easy task.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.995
Imagine transporting a collection

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.690
of clinical psychopaths across central London

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.829
in shackles and handcuffs

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.955
in rush hour,

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:02.129
and in order to place each
of them in an MRI scanner,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.110
you have to remove all metal objects,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.444
including shackles and handcuffs,

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:09.799
and, as I learned, all body piercings.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.036
After some time, however,
we had a tentative answer.

00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:16.854
These individuals were not just the victims

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:18.906
of a troubled childhood.

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:21.427
There was something else.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:25.047
People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.108
called the amygdala.

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.132
The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:32.455
deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:36.940
It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.846
Normally, the more empathic a person is,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.891
the larger and more active their amygdala is.

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:44.371
Our population of inmates

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:45.698
had a deficient amygdala,

00:04:45.698 --> 00:04:47.993
which likely led to their lack of empathy

00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:50.927
and to their immoral behavior.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:54.069
So let's take a step back.

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.692
Normally, acquiring moral behavior

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.082
is simply part of growing up,

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:01.283
like learning to speak.

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:04.574
At the age of six months, virtually every one of us

00:05:04.574 --> 00:05:08.531
is able to differentiate between
animate and inanimate objects.

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.005
At the age of 12 months,

00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:14.229
most children are able to imitate

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.114
the purposeful actions of others.

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:18.649
So for example, your mother raises her hands

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.388
to stretch, and you imitate her behavior.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.589
At first, this isn't perfect.

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.536
I remember my cousin Sasha,

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:28.699
two years old at the time,

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.359
looking through a picture book

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:33.542
and licking one finger and flicking
the page with the other hand,

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.647
licking one finger and flicking
the page with the other hand.

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:37.961
(Laughter)

00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.887
Bit by bit, we build the foundations 
of the social brain

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:46.519
so that by the time we're three, four years old,

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.811
most children, not all,

00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:49.584
have acquired the ability to understand

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:51.187
the intentions of others,

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:54.513
another prerequisite for empathy.

00:05:54.513 --> 00:05:57.125
The fact that this developmental progression

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.627
is universal,

00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:00.603
irrespective of where you live in the world

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:03.229
or which culture you inhabit,

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.442
strongly suggests that the foundations

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:08.566
of moral behavior are inborn.

00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:11.043
If you doubt this,

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:14.819
try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.896
to a four-year-old.

00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:18.684
You will find that the mind of a four-year old

00:06:18.684 --> 00:06:20.188
is not naÃ¯ve in the slightest.

00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:23.213
It is more akin to a Swiss army knife

00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:25.244
with fixed mental modules

00:06:25.244 --> 00:06:27.718
finely honed during development

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:30.835
and a sharp sense of fairness.

00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:33.493
The early years are crucial.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.737
There seems to be a window of opportunity,

00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:38.203
after which mastering moral questions

00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:39.685
becomes more difficult,

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:43.819
like adults learning a foreign language.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.853
That's not to say it's impossible.

00:06:45.853 --> 00:06:48.962
A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University

00:06:48.962 --> 00:06:51.203
showed that people who have played

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:53.612
a virtual reality game in which they took on

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:56.073
the role of a good and helpful superhero

00:06:56.073 --> 00:06:58.189
actually became more caring and helpful

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.692
towards others afterwards.

00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:02.901
Now I'm not suggesting

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.956
we endow criminals with superpowers,

00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:09.369
but I am suggesting that we need to find ways

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:11.247
to get Joe and people like him

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:13.892
to change their brains and their behavior,

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.667
for their benefit

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.802
and for the benefit of the rest of us.

00:07:18.802 --> 00:07:22.337
So can brains change?

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.921
For over 100 years,

00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:28.035
neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists

00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:31.855
held the view that after initial
development in childhood,

00:07:31.855 --> 00:07:34.279
no new brain cells could grow

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.580
in the adult human brain.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.067
The brain could only change

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.049
within certain set limits.

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:41.147
That was the dogma.

00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:43.386
But then, in the 1990s,

00:07:43.386 --> 00:07:45.082
studies starting showing,

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:47.819
following the lead of Elizabeth
Gould at Princeton and others,

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:51.154
studies started showing the
evidence of neurogenesis,

00:07:51.154 --> 00:07:53.212
the birth of new brain cells

00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:56.281
in the adult mammalian brain,

00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:57.865
first in the olfactory bulb,

00:07:57.865 --> 00:07:59.946
which is responsible for our sense of smell,

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.985
then in the hippocampus

00:08:01.985 --> 00:08:04.029
involving short-term memory,

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.312
and finally in the amygdala itself.

00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:09.088
In order to understand

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.047
how this process works,

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:13.936
I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:17.198
specializing in learning and development.

00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:20.968
Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice,

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.309
because the same pattern of brain responses

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:27.039
appears across many different
species of social animals.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.621
So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,

00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:34.309
a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.876
alone and without much stimulation,

00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:37.487
not only does it not thrive,

00:08:37.487 --> 00:08:39.244
but it will often develop strange,

00:08:39.244 --> 00:08:40.818
repetitive behaviors.

00:08:40.818 --> 00:08:43.437
This naturally sociable animal

00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:45.880
will lose its ability to bond with other mice,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.075
even becoming aggressive when introduced to them.

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:52.137
However, mice reared in what we called

00:08:52.137 --> 00:08:53.643
an enriched environment,

00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:55.854
a large habitation with other mice

00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:59.284
with wheels and ladders and areas to explore,

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:00.869
demonstrate neurogenesis,

00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:03.169
the birth of new brain cells,

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:05.483
and as we showed, they also perform better

00:09:05.483 --> 00:09:08.200
on a range of learning and memory tasks.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.630
Now, they don't develop morality to the point of

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.390
carrying the shopping bags of little old mice

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.611
across the street,

00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:17.354
but their improved environment results in healthy,

00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:19.267
sociable behavior.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.210
Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.675
not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:27.976
have dramatically lower levels of new neurons

00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:29.603
in the brain.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.419
It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:33.925
including primates like us,

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:36.437
can show neurogenesis.

00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:37.723
In some areas of the brain,

00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:41.418
more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:43.677
We're just beginning to understand

00:09:43.677 --> 00:09:45.771
what exact function these cells have,

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.697
but what it implies is that the brain is capable

00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:53.890
of extraordinary change way into adulthood.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.624
However, our brains are also

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:59.264
exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.814
Stress hormones, glucocorticoids,

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:03.364
released by the brain,

00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:06.925
suppress the growth of these new cells.

00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:09.473
The more stress, the less brain development,

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:13.941
which in turn causes less adaptability

00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.684
and causes higher stress levels.

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:20.469
This is the interplay between nature and nurture

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:24.174
in real time in front of our eyes.

00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:26.241
When you think about it,

00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:28.616
it is ironic that our current solution

00:10:28.616 --> 00:10:30.542
for people with stressed amygdalae

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.334
is to place them in an environment

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:36.663
that actually inhibits any chance of further growth.

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:39.150
Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.570
of the criminal justice system

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.335
and of protecting society.

00:10:43.335 --> 00:10:44.972
Our research does not suggest

00:10:44.972 --> 00:10:47.189
that criminals should submit their MRI scans

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:48.611
as evidence in court

00:10:48.611 --> 00:10:52.269
and get off the hook because
they've got a faulty amygdala.

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:54.342
The evidence is actually the other way.

00:10:54.342 --> 00:10:57.193
Because our brains are capable of change,

00:10:57.193 --> 00:10:59.691
we need to take responsibility for our actions,

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:01.543
and they need to take responsibility

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:04.971
for their rehabilitation.

00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:06.775
One way such rehabilitation might work

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:10.068
is through restorative justice programs.

00:11:10.068 --> 00:11:12.397
Here victims, if they choose to participate,

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:14.638
and perpetrators meet face to face

00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:17.338
in safe, structured encounters,

00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:19.168
and the perpetrator is encouraged

00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:21.137
to take responsibility for their actions,

00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:24.366
and the victim plays an active role in the process.

00:11:24.366 --> 00:11:27.237
In such a setting, the perpetrator can see,

00:11:27.237 --> 00:11:29.572
perhaps for the first time,

00:11:29.572 --> 00:11:31.976
the victim as a real person

00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:33.645
with thoughts and feelings and a genuine

00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:35.483
emotional response.

00:11:35.483 --> 00:11:37.374
This stimulates the amygdala

00:11:37.374 --> 00:11:40.925
and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:43.991
than simple incarceration.

00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:45.576
Such programs won't work for everyone,

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:48.265
but for many, it could be a way

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:52.626
to break the frozen sea within.

00:11:52.626 --> 00:11:55.385
So what can we do now?

00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:57.897
How can we apply this knowledge?

00:11:57.897 --> 00:12:00.218
I'd like to leave you with

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:01.963
three lessons that I learned.

00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:04.133
The first thing that I learned was that

00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:05.659
we need to change our mindset.

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.808
Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,

00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:11.923
society has advanced in virtually every aspect,

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:15.337
in the way we run our schools, our hospitals.

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:17.420
Yet the moment we speak about prisons,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.316
it's as though we're back in Dickensian times,

00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.540
if not medieval times.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.774
For too long, I believe,

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:28.439
we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded

00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:31.481
of the false notion that human 
nature cannot change,

00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:35.144
and as a society, it's costing us dearly.

00:12:35.144 --> 00:12:39.020
We know that the brain is
capable of extraordinary change,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.059
and the best way to achieve that,

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.471
even in adults, is to change and modulate

00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:46.266
our environment.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:49.151
The second thing I have learned

00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.777
is that we need to create an alliance

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:55.278
of people who believe that science is integral

00:12:55.278 --> 00:12:57.560
to bringing about social change.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.533
It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.712
a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:05.220
Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.879
but ultimately what we want to show

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:11.647
is whether we're able to
reduce the reoffending rates.

00:13:11.647 --> 00:13:14.368
In order to answer complex questions like that,

00:13:14.368 --> 00:13:17.019
we need people of different backgrounds --

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:19.223
lab-based scientists and clinicians,

00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:21.613
social workers and policy makers,

00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:24.236
philanthropists and human rights activists â

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.162
to work together.

00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:27.849
Finally, I believe we need

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.487
to change our own amygdalae,

00:13:29.487 --> 00:13:32.268
because this issue goes to the heart

00:13:32.268 --> 00:13:34.039
not just of who Joe is,

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.951
but who we are.

00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:38.931
We need to change our view of Joe

00:13:38.931 --> 00:13:42.733
as someone wholly irredeemable,

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:46.243
because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,

00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:50.523
how is he going to see himself as any different?

00:13:50.523 --> 00:13:52.394
In another decade, Joe will be released

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:55.063
from Wormwood Scrubs.

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:57.980
Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.474
who end up reoffending

00:13:59.474 --> 00:14:02.256
and returning to the prison system?

00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:04.892
Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,

00:14:04.892 --> 00:14:06.818
Joe was able to train his amygdala,

00:14:06.818 --> 00:14:09.172
which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.453
and connections,

00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:13.049
so that he will be able to face the world

00:14:13.049 --> 00:14:15.169
once he gets released?

00:14:15.169 --> 00:14:19.633
Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us.

00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:24.800
(Applause)

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.802
Thank you. (Applause)
