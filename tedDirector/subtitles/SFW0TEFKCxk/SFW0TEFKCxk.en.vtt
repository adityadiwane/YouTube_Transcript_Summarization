00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:18.974
I thought I'd talk a little bit
about how nature makes materials.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.188
I brought along with me an abalone shell.

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:23.787
This abalone shell
is a biocomposite material

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:26.660
that's 98 percent by mass
calcium carbonate

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:29.215
and two percent by mass protein.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.935
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher
than its geological counterpart.

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:36.398
And a lot of people might use
structures like abalone shells,

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:37.574
like chalk.

00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:40.389
I've been fascinated
by how nature makes materials,

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:43.768
and there's a lot of secrets
to how they do such an exquisite job.

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:48.060
Part of it is that these materials
are macroscopic in structure,

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.943
but they're formed at the nano scale.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.635
They're formed at the nano scale,

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.292
and they use proteins
that are coded by the genetic level

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:58.125
that allow them to build
these really exquisite structures.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.381
So something I think
is very fascinating is:

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:04.662
What if you could give life
to non-living structures,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.936
like batteries and like solar cells?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.244
What if they had
some of the same capabilities

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.936
that an abalone shell did,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.642
in terms of being able
to build really exquisite structures

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.499
at room temperature and room pressure,

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:18.568
using nontoxic chemicals

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.291
and adding no toxic materials
back into the environment?

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:24.573
So that's kind of the vision
that I've been thinking about.

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:27.263
And so what if you could grow
a battery in a Petri dish?

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.177
Or what if you could give
genetic information to a battery

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.003
so that it could actually become
better as a function of time, and do so

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.804
in an environmentally friendly way?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.266
And so, going back to this abalone shell,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.355
besides being nanostructured,
one thing that's fascinating is,

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.847
when a male and female
abalone get together,

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.076
they pass on the genetic
information that says,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.536
"This is how to build
an exquisite material.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.060
Here's how to do it at room
temperature and pressure,

00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:53.390
using nontoxic materials."

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:55.578
Same with diatoms,
which are shown right here,

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:57.225
which are glasseous structures.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.936
Every time the diatoms replicate,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.026
they give the genetic
information that says,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.714
"Here's how to build glass in the ocean
that's perfectly nanostructured."

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:07.031
And you can do it the same,
over and over again."

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.375
So what if you could do the same thing
with a solar cell or a battery?

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.936
I like to say my favorite
biomaterial is my four year old.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.197
But anyone who's ever had
or knows small children knows,

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.237
they're incredibly complex organisms.

00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.957
If you wanted to convince them to do
something they don't want to do,

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.139
it's very difficult.

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:26.179
So when we think
about future technologies,

00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:29.421
we actually think of using
bacteria and viruses --

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:30.653
simple organisms.

00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:33.333
Can you convince them
to work with a new toolbox,

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:36.607
so they can build a structure
that will be important to me?

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.932
Also, when we think
about future technologies,

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:41.169
we start with the beginning of Earth.

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.936
Basically, it took a billion years
to have life on Earth.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.071
And very rapidly,
they became multi-cellular,

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:49.672
they could replicate,
they could use photosynthesis

00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:51.633
as a way of getting their energy source.

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.999
But it wasn't until about 500
million years ago --

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:56.055
during the Cambrian
geologic time period --

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.124
that organisms in the ocean
started making hard materials.

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:02.712
Before that, they were all
soft, fluffy structures.

00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:05.424
It was during this time
that there was increased calcium,

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:07.304
iron and silicon in the environment,

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:10.570
and organisms learned
how to make hard materials.

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:12.785
So that's what I would like
to be able to do,

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.436
convince biology to work
with the rest of the periodic table.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.648
Now, if you look at biology,

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:22.490
there's many structures like DNA,
antibodies, proteins and ribosomes

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:23.714
you've heard about,

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:25.184
that are nanostructured --

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:28.716
nature already gives us really exquisite
structures on the nano scale.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.439
What if we could harness them

00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:35.161
and convince them to not be an antibody
that does something like HIV?

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:38.561
What if we could convince them
to build a solar cell for us?

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:40.684
Here are some examples.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.865
Natural shells,
natural biological materials.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.081
The abalone shell here.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:47.492
If you fracture it, you can look
at the fact that it's nanostructured.

00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:49.644
There's diatoms made out of SiO2,

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:51.526
and there are magnetotactic bacteria

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.936
that make small, single-domain
magnets used for navigation.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.628
What all these have in common

00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:59.209
is these materials
are structured at the nano scale,

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:02.559
and they have a DNA sequence
that codes for a protein sequence

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:04.089
that gives them the blueprint

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:06.936
to be able to build
these really wonderful structures.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.142
Now, going back to the abalone shell,

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.746
the abalone makes this shell
by having these proteins.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.794
These proteins
are very negatively charged.

00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:15.993
They can pull calcium
out of the environment,

00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:19.556
and put down a layer of calcium
and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.473
It has the chemical sequences
of amino acids which says,

00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:24.220
"This is how to build the structure.

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.688
Here's the DNA sequence,
here's the protein sequence

00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:27.863
in order to do it."

00:04:27.887 --> 00:04:29.134
So an interesting idea is,

00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:31.411
what if you could take
any material you wanted,

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:33.213
or any element on the periodic table,

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.595
and find its corresponding DNA sequence,

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:39.306
then code it for a corresponding
protein sequence to build a structure,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.966
but not build an abalone shell --

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.564
build something that nature has never had
the opportunity to work with yet.

00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:48.532
And so here's the periodic table.

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:50.343
I absolutely love the periodic table.

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:52.992
Every year for the incoming
freshman class at MIT,

00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:54.943
I have a periodic table made that says,

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:57.104
"Welcome to MIT.
Now you're in your element."

00:04:57.128 --> 00:04:58.137
(Laughter)

00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:00.450
And you flip it over,
and it's the amino acids

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:02.936
with the pH at which they have
different charges.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.936
And so I give this out
to thousands of people.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.056
And I know it says MIT
and this is Caltech,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.144
but I have a couple extra
if people want it.

00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:14.487
I was really fortunate to have
President Obama visit my lab this year

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:15.900
on his visit to MIT,

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:18.222
and I really wanted to give
him a periodic table.

00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:20.588
So I stayed up at night
and talked to my husband,

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.868
"How do I give President Obama
a periodic table?

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:24.960
What if he says,
'Oh, I already have one,'

00:05:24.984 --> 00:05:26.624
or, 'I've already memorized it?'"

00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:27.656
(Laughter)

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.960
So he came to visit my lab and looked
around -- it was a great visit.

00:05:30.984 --> 00:05:32.318
And then afterward, I said,

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:34.705
"Sir, I want to give you
the periodic table,

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.092
in case you're ever in a bind
and need to calculate molecular weight."

00:05:38.116 --> 00:05:39.202
(Laughter)

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:42.740
I thought "molecular weight" sounded
much less nerdy than "molar mass."

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:43.835
(Laughter)

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:46.758
And he looked at it and said,

00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.796
"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.936
(Laughter)

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.936
(Applause)

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.936
Later in a lecture
that he gave on clean energy,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.260
he pulled it out and said,

00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:02.022
"And people at MIT,
they give out periodic tables." So ...

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:04.354
So basically what I didn't tell you

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:07.979
is that about 500 million years ago,
the organisms started making materials,

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:10.837
but it took them about 50 million years
to get good at it --

00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:14.308
50 million years to learn how to perfect
how to make that abalone shell.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.456
And that's a hard sell
to a graduate student:

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.017
"I have this great project ...
50 million years ..."

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.545
So we had to develop a way
of trying to do this more rapidly.

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.322
And so we use a nontoxic virus
called M13 bacteriophage,

00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:29.303
whose job is to infect bacteria.

00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:31.033
Well, it has a simple DNA structure

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:35.185
that you can go in and cut and paste
additional DNA sequences into it,

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:39.702
and by doing that, it allows the virus
to express random protein sequences.

00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:41.639
This is pretty easy biotechnology,

00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:43.910
and you could basically
do this a billion times.

00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:46.244
So you can have
a billion different viruses

00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:47.975
that are all genetically identical,

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.437
but they differ from each other
based on their tips,

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:52.062
on one sequence,

00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:53.575
that codes for one protein.

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.353
Now if you take all billion viruses,
and put them in one drop of liquid,

00:06:57.377 --> 00:06:59.886
you can force them to interact
with anything you want

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.091
on the periodic table.

00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:03.232
And through a process
of selection evolution,

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.560
you can pull one of a billion
that does something you'd like it to do,

00:07:06.584 --> 00:07:08.338
like grow a battery or a solar cell.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.398
Basically, viruses can't replicate
themselves; they need a host.

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:13.386
Once you find that one out of a billion,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.847
you infect it into a bacteria,
and make millions and billions of copies

00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:18.259
of that particular sequence.

00:07:18.283 --> 00:07:20.461
The other thing
that's beautiful about biology

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:23.627
is that biology gives you
really exquisite structures

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:24.936
with nice link scales.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.771
These viruses are long and skinny,

00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:28.960
and we can get them to express the ability

00:07:28.984 --> 00:07:30.936
to grow something like semiconductors

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.066
or materials for batteries.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.936
Now, this is a high-powered
battery that we grew in my lab.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.673
We engineered a virus
to pick up carbon nanotubes.

00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:40.936
One part of the virus
grabs a carbon nanotube,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.045
the other part of the virus has a sequence

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:45.693
that can grow an electrode
material for a battery,

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:48.416
and then it wires itself
to the current collector.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.936
And so through a process
of selection evolution,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.102
we went from being able to have
a virus that made a crummy battery

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:55.807
to a virus that made a good battery

00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:58.703
to a virus that made a record-breaking,
high-powered battery

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:01.894
that's all made at room temperature,
basically at the benchtop.

00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:05.388
That battery went to the White House
for a press conference,

00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:06.823
and I brought it here.

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:09.626
You can see it in this case
that's lighting this LED.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.705
Now if we could scale this,

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.689
you could actually use it
to run your Prius,

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:19.057
which is kind of my dream --
to be able to drive a virus-powered car.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:20.198
(Laughter)

00:08:20.222 --> 00:08:24.936
But basically you can pull
one out of a billion,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.878
and make lots of amplifications to it.

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:29.175
Basically, you make
an amplification in the lab,

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:32.493
and then you get it to self-assemble
into a structure like a battery.

00:08:32.517 --> 00:08:34.783
We're able to do this also with catalysis.

00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:38.738
This is the example
of a photocatalytic splitting of water.

00:08:38.762 --> 00:08:41.750
And what we've been able to do
is engineer a virus

00:08:41.774 --> 00:08:44.060
to basically take dye-absorbing molecules

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:46.139
and line them up
on the surface of the virus

00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:47.474
so it acts as an antenna,

00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:50.171
and you get an energy transfer
across the virus.

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:53.458
And then we give it a second gene
to grow an inorganic material

00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:57.474
that can be used to split water
into oxygen and hydrogen,

00:08:57.498 --> 00:08:59.712
that can be used for clean fuels.

00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:01.812
I brought an example
of that with me today.

00:09:01.836 --> 00:09:03.654
My students promised me it would work.

00:09:03.678 --> 00:09:06.105
These are virus-assembled nanowires.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.936
When you shine light on them,
you can see them bubbling.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.895
In this case, you're seeing
oxygen bubbles come out.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.228
(Applause)

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.936
Basically, by controlling the genes,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.294
you can control multiple materials
to improve your device performance.

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.024
The last example are solar cells.

00:09:21.048 --> 00:09:22.863
You can also do this with solar cells.

00:09:22.887 --> 00:09:26.149
We've been able to engineer viruses
to pick up carbon nanotubes

00:09:26.173 --> 00:09:30.276
and then grow titanium
dioxide around them,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.319
and use it as a way of getting
electrons through the device.

00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:36.807
And what we've found
is through genetic engineering,

00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:41.634
we can actually increase
the efficiencies of these solar cells

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:43.635
to record numbers

00:09:43.659 --> 00:09:46.936
for these types of dye-sensitized systems.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.936
And I brought one of those as well,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.138
that you can play around
with outside afterward.

00:09:52.162 --> 00:09:54.027
So this is a virus-based solar cell.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:55.936
Through evolution and selection,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.456
we took it from an eight percent
efficiency solar cell

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.564
to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.

00:10:01.588 --> 00:10:03.421
So I hope that I've convinced you

00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:07.312
that there's a lot of great,
interesting things to be learned

00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:08.936
about how nature makes materials,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.611
and about taking it the next step,

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:15.132
to see if you can force or take advantage
of how nature makes materials,

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.837
to make things that nature
hasn't yet dreamed of making.

00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:19.012
Thank you.

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:20.186
(Applause)
