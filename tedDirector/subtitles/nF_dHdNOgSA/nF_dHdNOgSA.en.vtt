00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
And I come from a long way.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
telling my story in form of a book.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
And also telling it like now.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And also, the easiest one was

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
when I was doing it in form of a music.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
So I have branded myself as a war child.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I'm doing this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
because of an old lady in my village now,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
who have lost her children.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
There is no newspaper to cover her pain,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
and what she wants to change in this society.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
And I'm doing it for a young man

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
because he can't write.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
YouTube, for them to talk.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
this painful stories out, the dreams I have,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
that I have seen

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160
Well I was born in the most difficult time,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
when my country was at war.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
I saw my village burned down.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
vanish in my face.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
My mother was claimed by the war.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
My brothers and sisters were scattered.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
And up to now, me and my father

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
were detached and I still have issues with him.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Seeing people die every day,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
my mother crying,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
it's like I was raised in a violence.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And that made me call myself a war child.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And not only that, when I was eight

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
I became a child soldier.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
I didn't know what was the war for.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
But one thing I knew

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
When I went to the training camp I say,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
"I want to kill as many Muslims,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
and as many Arabs, as possible."

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
because I wanted to revenge for my family.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.160
I wanted to revenge for my village.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Luckily now things have changed

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
because I came to discover the truth.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
wasn't the Arabs.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
which is the oil, the diamond,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.160
the gold and the land.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
should I continue to hate, or let it go?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
music with the Muslims. I dance with them.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
I even had a movie out called "War Child,"

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
funded by Muslim people.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
So that pain has gone out.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
But my story is huge.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
So I'm just going to go into a different step now,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
which is easier for me.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
I'm going to give you poem

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
called "Forced to Sin,"

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
which is from my album "War Child."

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
I talk about my story.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
One of the journey that I tread

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
and we were like around 400.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And only 16 people survived that journey.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
So I hope you're going to hear this.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
My dreams are like torment.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
My every moment.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Friends like Lual who died by my side,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
of starvation.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.160
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
of my comrade,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
he gave me comfort.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
We used to raid villages,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
anything we could eat.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
And therefore I was forced to sin,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
forced to sin to make a living,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
forced to sin to make a living.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Never give up. Never give in.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Left home at the age of seven.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
Slept with one eye open wide.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Run, duck, play dead and hide.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
I've seen my people die like flies.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
But I've never seen a dead body,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
at least one that I've killed.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
As a child so young and tender,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Words I can't forget I still remember.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160
I saw sergeant command raising his hand,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
no retreat, no surrender.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
I carry the banner of the trauma.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
War child, child without a mama,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
still fighting in the saga.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
I'm on a fight, day and night.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
It's like I'm living a dream.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
First time I'm feeling like a human being.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Ah! The children of Darfur.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
that I'm fighting for.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Left home.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
My country is war-torn.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.160
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
Ask God question, what am I here for.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And why are my people poor.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
I was learning how to fight.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
snakes, and anything that had life.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
I was ready to eat.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.160
(Applause)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Thank you.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.160
(Applause)

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
I never saw anybody

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
to tell my story to them

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
so they could advise me or do therapy.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
So the music had been my therapy for me.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160
It's been where I actually see heaven,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
where I can be happy,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.160
where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
So one thing I know about music:

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
music is the only thing that has power

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
to enter your cell system,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
your mind, your heart,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
influence your soul and your spirit,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
and can even influence the way you live

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
without even you knowing.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
Music is the only thing that can

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
make you want to wake up your bed

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
and shake your leg,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
without even wanting to do it.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
And so the power music has

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
I normally compare to the power love

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
when love doesn't see a color.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
One testimony about how I find music

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
is powerful is when

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
I was still a soldier back then.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
I hated the people in the north.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.160
So we party and dance to their music.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
And one thing that shocked me is one day

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
they brought an Arab musician

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
to come and entertain the soldiers.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
But I had this question.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
So what's happening here?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
I've been in a painful journey.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
Today is day number 233

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
in which I only eat dinner.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
And I've done a campaign called

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
Lose to Win.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Where I'm losing so that I could win

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
the battle that I'm fighting now.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
So my breakfast, my lunch,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I donate it to a charity that I founded

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
because we want to build a school in Sudan.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
And I'm doing this because also

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
So in my village now, kids there,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and they are waiting to know,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
it means he got the money to build our school.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And so I made a commitment. I say,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
but I've been humbled.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
(Laughter)

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
So it's taken me 232 days.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
And I said, "No stop until we get it."

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
The people are giving three dollars.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Somebody donated 20 cents online.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
I don't know how they did it.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
(Laughter)

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
But that moved me.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.160
And so, the importance of education to me

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
is what I'm willing to die for.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
I'm willing to die for this,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
because I know what it can do to my people.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
Education enlighten your brain,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
give you so many chances,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
and you're able to survive.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
As a nation we have been crippled.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
For so many years we have fed on aid.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
families in a refugee camps.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
So these people,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
If anybody want to help us

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
this is what we need.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
(Applause)

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
Invest in education.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.160
Education so that we have strong institution

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
that can create a revolution to change everything.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Because we have all those old men

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
But if you invest in education

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
then we'll be able to change Africa.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
That's what I'm asking.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.160
(Applause)

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
So in order to do that,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
I founded a charter called Gua Africa,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
where we put kids in school.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
And now we have a couple in university.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
That's what I want to do to change,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
to make a difference in the world.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Well now, my time is going,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
so I want to sing a song.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
But I'll ask you guys to stand up

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
called Emma McCune

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
that made it possible for me to be here.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
I'm gonna sing this song,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
She came to my country and saw the importance

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
of education.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
She said the only way to help Sudan

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
is to invest in the women, educating them,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
educating the children,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
so that they could come and create a revolution

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
in this complex society.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
So she even ended up marrying a commander

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
from the SPLA.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
One of them happened to be me now.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
Audience: Yes!

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
Emmanuel Jal: All right.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
♫ This one goes to Emma McCune ♫

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160

♫ Just another little starving child ♫

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
♫ Running around in Africa, born to be wild ♫

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
♫ Praise God, praise the Almighty ♫

♫ for sending an angel to rescue me ♫

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
♫ I got a reason for being on this Earth ♫

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
♫ 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth ♫

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
♫ Now that I got a chance to stand my ground ♫

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
♫ I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds ♫

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
♫ I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon ♫

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
♫ And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune ♫

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.160

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
♫ I would have probably died from starvation ♫

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160

♫ I remember the time when I was small ♫

♫ The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one ♫

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160
♫ How I prayed for this day to come ♫

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
♫ And I pray that the world find wisdom ♫

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
♫ To give the poor in need some assistance ♫

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
♫ Instead of putting up resistance, yeah ♫

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
♫ Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this ♫

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
♫ It ain't gonna happen ♫

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
♫ They're all sitting on they asses ♫

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
♫ Popping champagne and sponging off the masses ♫

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
♫ Coming from a refugee boy-soldier ♫

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
♫ But I still got my dignity ♫

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
♫ I gotta say it again ♫

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
♫ If Emma never rescued me ♫

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
♫ I'd be a corpse on the African plain ♫

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
Is there anybody who's here in the back, some love.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
Big scream for Emma everybody.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
Yeah! I'm gonna get crazy now.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
♫ What would I be? ♫

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
♫ If Emma never rescued me? ♫

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160

♫ Yeah, Yeah ♫

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
♫ Yeah, I would have probably died from starvation ♫

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160
♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
(Applause)

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
Go save a life of a child.
