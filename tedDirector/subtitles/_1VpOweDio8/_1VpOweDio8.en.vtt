00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.543
I would like to start

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.504
with the story of Mary,

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:19.495
a woman from an African village.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.088
Her first memories

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.940
are of her family fleeing violent riots

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.797
orchestrated by 
the ruling political party.

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:31.794
Her brother was murdered
by the state-sponsored militia,

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:33.371
and she was raped more than once

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.580
just because she belonged
to the wrong party.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.743
One morning, a month before the election,

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:45.464
Mary's village was called 
to another intimidation meeting.

00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:48.243
In this meeting, there is a man
standing in front of them,

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:50.701
telling them, "We know who you are,

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.352
we know who you will vote for,

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.762
and if you're not going
to drop the right paper,

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:59.100
we're going to take revenge."

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.059
But for Mary, this meeting is different.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.793
She feels different.

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:06.430
This time, she's waiting for this meeting,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.599
because this time, she's carrying
a small hidden camera in her dress,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.655
a camera that nobody else can see.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.722
Nobody is allowed to film
in these meetings.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:17.781
You risk your life if you do.

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:22.179
Mary knows that, but she also knows
that the only way to stop them

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.751
and to protect herself and her community

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.066
is to expose their intimidation,

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.048
to make sure they understand
somebody is following them,

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:35.738
to break the impunity they feel.

00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:39.724
Mary and her friends were filming
for months, undercover,

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.491
the intimidation of
the ruling political party.

Nothing can stop us 
from doing what we want.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:57.158
If we hear you are with [The Opposition]

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.694
we will not forgive you.

Some have lost their homes.

with [The Party],

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.432

00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:53.586
Oren Yakobovich: These images
were broadcast all over the world,

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:55.183
but more importantly,

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:58.336
they have been broadcast
back to the community.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:01.220
The perpetrators saw them too.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.461
They understood somebody
is following them.

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.070
They got scared. Impunity was broken.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.156
Mary and her friends forced
the ruling political party

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.406
not to use violence during the election,

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:15.895
and saved hundreds of lives.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.402
Mary is just one of hundreds of people

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:21.962
that my organization had helped 
to document human rights violations

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:24.862
using cameras.

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:28.223
My background should have
led me to a different direction.

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:31.472
I was born in Israel
to a right-wing family,

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:33.378
and as long as I remember myself,

00:03:33.378 --> 00:03:36.473
I wanted to join the Israeli army
to serve my country

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:40.924
and prove what I believed 
was our right for the whole land.

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:46.204
I joined the Israeli army 
just after the first intifada,

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.584
the first Palestinian uprising,

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.492
and I served in one of the hard-minded,

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:54.012
toughest, aggressive infantry units,

00:03:54.012 --> 00:03:58.971
and I got the biggest gun in my platoon.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.431
Quite fast, I became an officer

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:04.422
and got soldiers under my command,

00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:07.347
and as time passed, I started
serving in the West Bank,

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:10.203
and I saw these images.

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:20.077
I didn't like what I saw.

00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:21.496
It took me a while,

00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:24.738
but eventually I refused
to serve in the West Bank

00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:27.594
and had to spend time in jail.

00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:28.754
It was a bit —

00:04:28.754 --> 00:04:31.730
(Applause) —

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.422
It was not that bad, I have to say.

00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:36.505
It was a bit like being in a hotel,
but with very shitty food.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.170
(Laughter)

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.042
In jail, I kept thinking 
that I need people to know.

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:43.708
I need people to understand

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:46.564
what the reality
in the West Bank looks like.

00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:49.002
I need them to hear what I heard,

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.906
I need them to see what I saw,

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:54.244
but I also understood, we need 
the Palestinians themselves,

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:55.733
the people that are suffering,

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.965
to be able to tell their own stories,

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:03.576
not journalists or filmmakers
that are coming outside of the situation.

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.649
I joined a human rights organization,

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.789
an Israeli human rights 
organization called B'Tselem.

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.864
Together, we analyzed the West Bank

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:15.789
and picked 100 families that
are living in the most risky places:

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.604
close to checkpoints, near army bases,

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:22.059
side by side with settlers.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.901
We gave them cameras and training.

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:30.231
Quite fast, we started getting
very disturbing images

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:35.213
about how the settlers 
and the soldiers are abusing them.

00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:38.333
I would like to share with you
two clips from this project.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:42.478
Both of them were broadcast in Israel,
and it created a massive debate.

00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:43.770
And I have to warn you,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.030
some of you might 
find them quite explicit.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.454
The masked men you 
will see in the first clips

00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:51.184
are Jewish settlers.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.670
Minutes before the camera was turned on,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.548
they approached a Palestinian family

00:05:55.548 --> 00:05:57.360
that was working their land

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.567
and told them that they
have to leave the land,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.119
because this land belongs
to the Jewish settlers.

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.046
The Palestinians refused.

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:07.109
Let's see what happened.

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:10.925
The masked men that are approaching
are Jewish settlers.

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:16.259
They are approaching
the Palestinian family.

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:35.461
This is a demonstration in the West Bank.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.063
The guy in green is Palestinian.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.873
He will be arrested in a second.

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:42.706
Here you see him
blindfolded and handcuffed.

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:46.362
In a few seconds, he regrets 
he came to this demonstration.

00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:54.070
He's been shot in the foot
with a rubber bullet.

00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:57.642
He is okay.

00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:04.813
Not all the settlers and the soldiers
are acting this way.

00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:09.058
We're talking about a tiny minority,
but they have to be brought to justice.

00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:11.311
These clips, and others like them,

00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.709
forced the army and the police
to start investigations.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.963
They've been shown in Israel, of course,

00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:19.509
and the Israeli public
was exposed to them also.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.107
This project redefined
the struggle for human rights

00:07:23.107 --> 00:07:24.708
in the occupied territories,

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:29.591
and we managed to reduce the number 
of violent attacks in the West Bank.

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:34.716
The success of this project
got me thinking

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:38.297
how I can take the same methodology
to other places in the world.

00:07:38.306 --> 00:07:40.016
Now, we tend to believe that today,

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:41.722
with all of the technology,

00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:43.352
the smartphones and the Internet,

00:07:43.352 --> 00:07:46.748
we are able to see and understand
most of what's happening in the world,

00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:48.897
and people are able to tell their story —

00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:50.796
but it's only partly true.

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:53.794
Still today, with all
the technology we have,

00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:56.202
less than half of the world's population

00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:58.478
has access to the Internet,

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.025
and more than three billion people —

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:02.589
I'm repeating the number —

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:08.891
three billion people are consuming news
that is censored by those in power.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.419
More or less around the same time,

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.537
I'm approached by a great guy
named Uri Fruchtmann.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.893
He's a filmmaker and an activist.

00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:20.469
We understood we were
thinking along the same lines,

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:26.658
and we decided to establish Videre,
our organization, together.

00:08:26.658 --> 00:08:29.522
While building the organization in London,

00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:31.594
we've been traveling undercover to places

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.781
where a community 
was suffering from abuses,

00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:36.449
where mass atrocities were happening,

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:39.326
and there was a lack of reporting.

00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:43.121
We tried to understand how we can help.

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.790
There were four things that I learned.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.250
The first thing is that we have to engage

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.409
with communities that are
living in rural areas,

00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:54.814
where violations are happening
far from the public eye.

00:08:54.814 --> 00:08:56.645
We need to partner with them,

00:08:56.645 --> 00:09:00.566
and we need to understand which images
are not making it out there

00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:03.474
and help them to document them.

00:09:03.824 --> 00:09:05.642
The second thing I learned

00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:09.424
is that we have to enable them 
to film in a safe way.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:13.803
Security has to be the priority.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:16.006
Where I used to work before,
in the West Bank,

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:17.646
one can take a camera out,

00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:20.339
most likely not going to get shot,

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:21.884
but in places we wanted to work,

00:09:21.884 --> 00:09:27.094
just try to pull a phone out,
and you're dead — literally dead.

00:09:27.094 --> 00:09:28.624
This is why we decided

00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:30.568
to take the operation undercover

00:09:30.568 --> 00:09:31.995
when necessary,

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:34.026
and use mostly hidden cameras.

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:37.403
Unfortunately, I can't show you
the hidden cameras we're using today —

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.845
for obvious reasons —

00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:41.097
but these are cameras we used before.

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.187
You can buy them off the shelf.

00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:46.786
Today, we're building 
a custom-made hidden camera,

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.648
like the one that Mary was wearing

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:50.942
in her dress to film
the intimidation meeting

00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:52.954
of the ruling political party.

00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:54.796
It's a camera that nobody can see,

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:57.745
that blends into the environment,

00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:59.824
into the surroundings.

00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:03.272
Now, filming securities go beyond
using hidden cameras.

00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:08.162
Being secure starts way before
the activist is turning the camera on.

00:10:08.162 --> 00:10:10.214
To keep our partners safe,

00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:12.966
we work to understand
the risk of every location

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.647
and of every shot before it's happened,

00:10:15.647 --> 00:10:18.549
building a backup plan
if something goes wrong,

00:10:18.549 --> 00:10:20.941
and making sure 
we have everything in place

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.892
before our operations start.

00:10:23.892 --> 00:10:27.707
The third thing I learned
is the importance of verification.

00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:30.311
You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,

00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:34.079
but if you can't verify it,
it's worth nothing.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:37.562
Recently, like in the ongoing war 
in Syria or the war in Gaza,

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:42.875
we've seen images that are staged 
or brought from a different conflict.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.828
This misinformation destroyed
the credibility of the source,

00:10:45.828 --> 00:10:50.608
and it's harmed the credibility of other
reliable and trustworthy sources.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.611
We use a variety of ways to make sure
we can verify the information

00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:56.559
and we can trust the material.

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.432
It starts with vetting the partners,

00:10:58.432 --> 00:11:01.645
understanding who they are,
and working with them very intensively.

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:03.780
How do you film a location?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.614
You film road signs, you film watches,

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:06.956
you film newspapers.

00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:11.442
We are checking maps, looking at maps,

00:11:11.442 --> 00:11:13.695
double-checking the information,

00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:18.078
and looking also at 
the metadata of the material.

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:21.197
Now, the fourth and the most
important thing I learned

00:11:21.197 --> 00:11:25.466
is how you use images 
to create a positive change.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.299
To have an effect,

00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:32.886
the key thing is how you use the material.

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:35.404
Today, we're working
with hundreds of activists

00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:36.953
filming undercover.

00:11:36.953 --> 00:11:40.055
We work with them both to understand 
the situation on the ground

00:11:40.055 --> 00:11:43.045
and which images 
are missing to describe it,

00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:47.979
who are the ones that are 
influencing the situation,

00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:52.036
and when to release the material
to advance the struggle.

00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:54.473
Sometimes, it's about
putting it in the media,

00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:56.399
mostly local ones, to create awareness.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.835
Sometimes it's working
with decision makers,

00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:00.009
to change laws.

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:04.535
Sometimes, it's working with lawyers
to use as evidence in court.

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:06.053
But more than often,

00:12:06.053 --> 00:12:10.011
the most effective way
to create a social change

00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:12.342
is to work within the community.

00:12:12.342 --> 00:12:14.575
I want to give you one example.

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:20.351
Fatuma is part of a network of women
that are fighting abuses in Kenya.

00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.282
Women in her community
have been harassed constantly

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:26.157
on their way to school
and on their way to work.

00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:29.854
They are trying to change 
the behavior of the community from inside.

00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:32.384
In the next clip,

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:36.649
Fatuma is taking us with her
on her journey to work.

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:40.553
Her voice is superimposed
on images that she filmed herself

00:12:40.557 --> 00:12:43.095
using hidden cameras.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.572
(Video) Fatuma Chiusiku: 
My name is Fatuma Chiusiku.

00:12:45.572 --> 00:12:47.824
I'm 32 years old, a mother,

00:12:47.824 --> 00:12:51.439
And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:53.652
Each morning, I ride the mini-bus

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:56.009
Number 11.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.062
But instead of a peaceful journey to work,

00:12:59.062 --> 00:13:02.491
each day begins with fear.

00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:03.991
Come with me now

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.796
and use my eyes

00:13:05.796 --> 00:13:11.569
to feel what I feel.

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:13.714
As I walk, I think to myself:

00:13:13.714 --> 00:13:15.385
Will I be touched?

00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:16.650
Grabbed?

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.114
Violated by this conductor again?

00:13:20.114 --> 00:13:22.207
Even the men inside

00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:24.350
the way they look at me

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.666
touch my body, rub against me,

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:28.619
grab me,

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.892
and now, as I sit in my seat

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:33.734
I only wish my mind was full
of thoughts for my day,

00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:35.350
my dreams, my children at school,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.617
but instead I worry about
the moment when we will arrive

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:44.785
and I will be violated again.

00:13:44.785 --> 00:13:50.150
OY: Today, there is a new front
in the fight for human rights.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.695
I used to carry a big gun.

00:13:52.695 --> 00:13:55.868
Now, I am carrying this.

00:13:55.868 --> 00:14:02.298
This is a much more powerful
and much, much more effective weapon.

00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:06.429
But we have to use its power wisely.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:11.793
By putting the right images
in the right hands at the right time,

00:14:11.793 --> 00:14:14.585
we can truly create an impact.

00:14:14.585 --> 00:14:16.819
Thank you.

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:25.244
(Applause)

00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:27.848
Thank you.

00:14:27.848 --> 00:14:30.611
(Applause)
