00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:50.385
So I was born and raised

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:53.272
in the shadow of a shipyard

00:01:53.272 --> 00:01:57.288
in a little town on the northeast coast of England.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:01:59.306
Some of my earliest memories

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.284
are of giant ships

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:04.014
blocking the end of my street,

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:07.059
as well as the sun, for a lot of the year.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.016
Every morning as a child,

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:12.121
I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.219
to work in the shipyard.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.951
I'd watch those same men

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.651
walking back home every night.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.543
It has to be said, the shipyard was not

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:24.319
the most pleasant place to live next door to,

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.419
or indeed work in.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.895
The shipyard was noisy, dangerous,

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:31.911
highly toxic,

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:35.407
with an appalling health and safety record.

00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:38.575
Despite that, the men and women

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.225
who worked on those ships

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.117
were extraordinarily proud of the work they did,

00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:45.117
and justifiably so.

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:46.651
Some of the largest vessels

00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.579
ever constructed on planet Earth

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.379
were built right at the end of my street.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.440
My grandfather had been a shipwright,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.777
and as a child,

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.649
as there were few other jobs in the town,

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.213
I would wonder with some anxiety

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.371
whether that would be my destiny too.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.443
I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be.

00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:09.087
I had other dreams,

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.589
not necessarily practical ones,

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.575
but at the age of eight,

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.367
I was bequeathed a guitar.

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:17.783
It was a battered old thing

00:03:17.783 --> 00:03:21.391
with five rusty strings, and was out of tune,

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:23.839
but quickly I learned to play it

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:29.037
and realized that I'd found a friend for life,

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.703
an accomplice, a co-conspirator

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:35.587
in my plan to escape from this surreal

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:38.275
industrial landscape.

00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:40.357
Well, they say if you dream something hard enough,

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:42.097
it will come to pass.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.133
Either that, or I was extremely lucky,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.247
but this was my dream.

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:47.929
I dreamt I would leave this town,

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.481
and just like those ships,

00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.669
once they were launched, I'd never come back.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.265
I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs,

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:57.643
that I would sing those songs

00:03:57.643 --> 00:04:00.561
to vast numbers of people all over the world,

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:04.710
that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.915
that I'd become famous,

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.607
that I'd marry a beautiful woman,

00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:12.247
have children, raise a family,

00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:14.231
buy a big house in the country,

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.951
keep dogs, grow wine,

00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:18.961
have rooms full of Grammy Awards,

00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.257
platinum discs, and what have you.

00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:26.871
So far, so good, right? (Laughter)

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:31.061
And then one day, the songs stopped coming,

00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:33.978
and while you've suffered from periods

00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:36.990
of writer's block before, albeit briefly,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.927
this is something chronic.

00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:41.061
Day after day, you face a blank page,

00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:42.697
and nothing's coming.

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:44.969
And those days turned to
weeks, and weeks to months,

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.562
and pretty soon those months

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:47.793
have turned into years

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:52.612
with very little to show for your efforts. No songs.

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:55.123
So you start asking yourself questions.

00:04:55.123 --> 00:04:57.296
What have I done to offend the gods

00:04:57.296 --> 00:05:00.863
that they would abandon me so?

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:03.599
Is the gift of songwriting taken away

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.856
as easily as it seems to have been bestowed?

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:08.889
Or perhaps there's a more --

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.989
a deeper psychological reason.

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:14.004
It was always a Faustian pact anyway.

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:16.231
You're rewarded for revealing

00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:18.243
your innermost thoughts,

00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:20.070
your private emotions on the page

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.820
for the entertainment of others,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.141
for the analysis, the scrutiny of others,

00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:29.190
and perhaps you've given enough

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.183
of your privacy away.

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:35.433
And yet, if you look at your work,

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:37.704
could it be argued that your best work

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.092
wasn't about you at all,

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:41.893
it was about somebody else?

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:43.980
Did your best work occur

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.125
when you sidestepped your own ego

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:48.625
and you stopped telling your story,

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.447
but told someone else's story,

00:05:50.447 --> 00:05:53.023
someone perhaps without a voice,

00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:55.551
where empathetically, you stood in his shoes

00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:59.100
for a while or saw the world through his eyes?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.077
Well they say, write what you know.

00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:04.800
If you can't write about yourself anymore,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.413
then who do you write about?

00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:10.262
So it's ironic that the landscape

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.627
I'd worked so hard to escape from,

00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:14.917
and the community that I'd more or less abandoned

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.086
and exiled myself from

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:19.087
should be the very landscape,

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.167
the very community I would have to return to

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:25.447
to find my missing muse.

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:27.591
And as soon as I did that,

00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.950
as soon as I decided to honor the community

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.336
I came from and tell their story,

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:36.770
that the songs started to come thick and fast.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.603
I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:48.525
a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:51.847
of verses, couplets, entire songs

00:06:51.847 --> 00:06:54.359
almost formed whole,

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:56.019
materialized in front of me

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:57.943
as if they'd been bottled up inside me

00:06:57.943 --> 00:06:59.917
for many, many years.

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.412
One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names

00:07:02.412 --> 00:07:04.341
of people I'd known,

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.643
and they become characters

00:07:05.643 --> 00:07:07.980
in a kind of three-dimensional drama,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.340
where they explain who they are, what they do,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.399
their hopes and their fears for the future.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.709
This is Jackie White.

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:20.553
He's the foreman of the shipyard.

00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:22.209
My name is Jackie White,

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:23.981
and I'm foreman of the yard,

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:26.579
and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.499
I'm as hard as iron plate,

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.519
woe betide you if you're late

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.513
when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide.

00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:35.449
Now you can die and hope for heaven,

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.611
but you need to work your shift,

00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.211
and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt,

00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.385
for if St. Peter at his gate

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.200
were to ask you why you're late,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.370
why, you tell him that you had to get a ship built.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.969
We build battleships and cruisers

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.765
for Her Majesty the Queen,

00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:54.378
supertankers for Onassis,
and all the classes in between,

00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.677
We built the greatest ship in tonnage

00:07:56.677 --> 00:08:00.253

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:30.787
So having decided to write about other people

00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:33.712
instead of myself,

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:35.639
a further irony is that sometimes you reveal

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:38.109
more about yourself than you'd ever intended.

00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:39.825
This song is called "Dead Man's Boots,"

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:40.989
which is an expression

00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:43.771
which describes how difficult it is to get a job;

00:08:43.771 --> 00:08:46.070
in other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.193
if somebody else died.

00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:50.807
Or perhaps your father could finagle you

00:08:50.807 --> 00:08:54.199
an apprenticeship at the age of 15.

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:56.681
But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued

00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:58.544
as controlling,

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:01.636
and conversely, the scope of his son's ambition

00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:05.624
can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy.

Thank you.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:19.238
So whenever they'd launch a big ship,

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.980
they would invite some dignitary up from London

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.358
on the train to make a speech,

00:12:23.358 --> 00:12:26.063
break a bottle of champagne over the bows,

00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:27.722
launch it down the slipway

00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:29.845
into the river and out to sea.

00:12:29.845 --> 00:12:32.282
Occasionally on a really important ship,

00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:34.462
they'd get a member of the royal family to come,

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.581
Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody.

00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:40.493
And you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.618
that the royal family in England

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:46.801
were considered to have magical healing powers.

00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:48.617
Sick children were held up in crowds

00:12:48.617 --> 00:12:50.862
to try and touch the cloak

00:12:50.862 --> 00:12:52.306
of the king or the queen to cure them

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:55.081
of some terrible disease.

00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:59.040
It wasn't like that in my day,
but we still got very excited.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.008
So it's a launch day, it's a Saturday,

00:13:01.008 --> 00:13:03.295
and my mother has dressed
me up in my Sunday best.

00:13:03.295 --> 00:13:05.970
I'm not very happy with her.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.544
All the kids are out in the street,

00:13:07.544 --> 00:13:10.316
and we have little Union Jacks to wave,

00:13:10.316 --> 00:13:12.372
and at the top of the hill,

00:13:12.372 --> 00:13:15.090
there's a motorcycle cortege appears.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.557
In the middle of the motorcycles,

00:13:16.557 --> 00:13:19.252
there's a big, black Rolls-Royce.

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:21.847
Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother.

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.912
This is a big deal.

00:13:23.912 --> 00:13:25.924
So the procession is moving

00:13:25.924 --> 00:13:27.954
at a stately pace down my street,

00:13:27.954 --> 00:13:30.244
and as it approaches my house,

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:32.785
I start to wave my flag vigorously,

00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.512
and there is the Queen Mother.

00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:38.220
I see her, and she seems to see me.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.970
She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.533
And I wave my flag even more vigorously.

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:44.944
We're having a moment,

00:13:44.944 --> 00:13:46.658
me and the Queen Mother.

00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:48.502
She's acknowledged me.

00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:51.541
And then she's gone.

00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:55.664
Well, I wasn't cured of anything.

00:13:55.664 --> 00:13:57.268
It was the opposite, actually.

00:13:57.268 --> 00:14:00.592
I was infected.

00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:03.199
I was infected with an idea.

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:05.916
I don't belong in this street.

00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:08.544
I don't want to live in that house.

00:14:08.544 --> 00:14:11.619
I don't want to end up in that shipyard.

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:15.026
I want to be in that car. (Laughter)

00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:16.990
I want a bigger life.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.534
I want a life beyond this town.

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:23.518
I want a life that's out of the ordinary.

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:24.832
It's my right.

00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:27.694
It's my right as much as hers.

00:14:27.694 --> 00:14:32.293
And so here I am at TED,

00:14:32.293 --> 00:14:34.828
I suppose to tell that story,

00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:39.402
and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious

00:14:39.402 --> 00:14:43.692
that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link

00:14:43.692 --> 00:14:46.922
between storytelling and community,

00:14:46.922 --> 00:14:49.118
between community and art,

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:52.132
between community and science and technology,

00:14:52.132 --> 00:14:54.898
between community and economics.

00:14:54.898 --> 00:14:58.286
It's my belief that

00:14:58.286 --> 00:15:00.335
abstract economic theory

00:15:00.335 --> 00:15:03.109
that denies the needs of community

00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:06.280
or denies the contribution that community makes

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.219
to economy is shortsighted, cruel

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:12.827
and untenable.

00:15:12.827 --> 00:15:16.583
(Applause)

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.479
The fact is, whether you're a rock star

00:15:19.479 --> 00:15:23.099
or whether you're a welder in a shipyard,

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:26.359

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.911
or the queen of England,

00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:32.047
at the end of the day,

00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:36.087
