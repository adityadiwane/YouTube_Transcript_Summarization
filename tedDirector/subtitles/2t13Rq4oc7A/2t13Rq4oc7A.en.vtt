00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080
In 1962 at Rice University,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.176
JFK told the country about a dream he had,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.096
a dream to put a person on the moon
by the end of the decade.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.520
The eponymous moonshot.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.696
No one knew if it was possible to do

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.080
but he made sure a plan was put in place
to do it if it was possible.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.336
That's how great dreams are.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.816
Great dreams aren't just visions,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520
they're visions coupled to strategies
for making them real.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.496
I have the incredible good fortune
to work at a moonshot factory.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.816
At X -- formerly called Google X --

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.536
you'll find an aerospace engineer
working alongside a fashion designer

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.280
and former military ops commanders
brainstorming with laser experts.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.536
These inventors, engineers and makers
are dreaming up technologies

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.320
that we hope can make the world
a wonderful place.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.736
We use the word "moonshots"
to remind us to keep our visions big --

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.456
to keep dreaming.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.936
And we use the word "factory"
to remind ourselves

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.056
that we want to have concrete visions --

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.376
concrete plans to make them real.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.336
Here's our moonshot blueprint.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.576
Number one:

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.016
we want to find
a huge problem in the world

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.296
that affects many millions of people.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.816
Number two:

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.640
we want to find or propose a radical
solution for solving that problem.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.856
And then number three:

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.856
there has to be some reason to believe

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.936
that the technology
for such a radical solution

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.400
could actually be built.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.496
But I have a secret for you.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.760
The moonshot factory is a messy place.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.416
But rather than avoid the mess,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.976
pretend it's not there,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.840
we've tried to make that our strength.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.896
We spend most of our time breaking things

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.880
and trying to prove that we're wrong.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.960
That's it, that's the secret.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.216
Run at all the hardest
parts of the problem first.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.295
Get excited and cheer,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.759
"Hey! How are we going
to kill our project today?"

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.640
We've got this interesting balance going

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.096
where we allow our unchecked
optimism to fuel our visions.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.576
But then we also harness
enthusiastic skepticism

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.640
to breathe life, breathe reality
into those visions.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.256
I want to show you a few of the projects

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.976
that we've had to leave behind
on the cutting room floor,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.576
and also a few of the gems

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.296
that at least so far,
have not only survived that process,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.080
but have been accelerated by it.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.176
Last year we killed a project
in automated vertical farming.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.216
This is some of the lettuce that we grew.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.816
One in nine people in the world
suffers from undernourishment.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.936
So this is a moonshot
that needs to happen.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.616
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.776
and a hundred times less land
than conventional farming.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.960
And because you can grow the food
close to where it's consumed,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.880
you don't have to
transport it large distances.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.456
We made progress in a lot of the areas

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.096
like automated harvesting
and efficient lighting.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.576
But unfortunately,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.656
we couldn't get staple crops
like grains and rice to grow this way.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.200
So we killed the project.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.480
Here's another huge problem.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.416
We pay enormous costs in resources
and environmental damage

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.656
to ship goods worldwide.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.256
Economic development
of landlocked countries

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.856
is limited by lack
of shipping infrastructure.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.496
The radical solution?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.720
A lighter-than-air,
variable-buoyancy cargo ship.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.616
This has the potential to lower,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.256
at least overall,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.816
the cost, time and carbon
footprint of shipping

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.120
without needing runways.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.936
We came up with this clever set
of technical breakthroughs

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.896
that together might make it possible
for us to lower the cost enough

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.056
that we could actually make these ships --

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.720
inexpensively enough in volume.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.079
But however cheap they would
have been to make in volume

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.176
it turned out that it was going to cost
close to 200 million dollars

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.320
to design and build the first one.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.336
200 million dollars
is just way too expensive.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.176
Because X is structured
with these tight feedback loops

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.856
of making mistakes
and learning and new designs,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.616
we can't spend 200 million dollars

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.376
to get the first data point

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.960
about whether we're
on the right track or not.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.936
If there's an Achilles' heel
in one our projects,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.256
we want to know it now, up front,
not way down the road.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.960
So we killed this project, too.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.616
Discovering a major flaw in a project

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.776
doesn't always mean
that it ends the project.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.976
Sometimes it actually gets us
onto a more productive path.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.936
This is our fully self-driving
vehicle prototype,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.120
which we built without
a steering wheel or break pedal.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.200
But that wasn't actually
our goal when we started.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.656
With 1.2 million people dying
on the roads globally every year,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.496
building a car that drives itself
was a natural moonshot to take.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.120
Three and a half years ago,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.496
when we had these Lexus,
retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.176
they were doing so well,
we gave them out to other Googlers

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.440
to find out what they thought
of the experience.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.256
And what we discovered

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.896
was that our plan to have the cars
do almost all the driving

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.816
and just hand over to the users
in case of emergency

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.920
was a really bad plan.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.856
It wasn't safe

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.016
because the users didn't do their job.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.480
They didn't stay alert

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.216
in case the car needed
to hand control back to them.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.256
This was a major crisis for the team.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.320
It sent them back to the drawing board.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.680
And they came up
with a beautiful, new perspective.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.320
Aim for a car where
you're truly a passenger.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.536
You tell the car where you want to go,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.816
you push a button

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.000
and it takes you
from point A to point B by itself.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.016
We're really grateful

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.576
that we had this insight
as early on in the project as we did.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.560
And it's shaped everything
we've done since then.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.536
And now our cars have self-driven
more than 1.4 million miles,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.176
and they're out everyday

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.240
on the streets of Mountain View,
California and Austin, Texas.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.976
The cars team shifted their perspective.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.056
This is one of X's mantras.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.880
Sometimes shifting your perspective
is more powerful than being smart.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.376
Take wind energy.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.736
It's one of my favorite examples
of perspective shifting.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.616
There's no way that we're going to build

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.040
a better standard wind turbine
than the experts in that industry.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.616
But we found a way
to get up higher into the sky,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.456
and so get access to faster,
more consistent winds,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.136
and so more energy without needing
hundreds of tons of steel to get there.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.496
Our Makani energy kite
rises up from its perch

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.536
by spinning up those
propellers along its wing.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.880
And it pulls out a tether as it rises,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.536
pulling energy up through the tether.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.416
Once the tether's all the way out,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.600
it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.680
And now those propellers that lifted it up
have become flying turbines.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.080
And that sends energy
back down the tether.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.736
We haven't yet found
a way to kill this project.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.856
And the longer it survives that pressure,
the more excited we get

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.336
that this could become
a cheaper and more deployable form

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.280
of wind energy for the world.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.560
Probably the craziest sounding project
we have is Project Loon.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.856
We're trying to make
balloon-powered Internet.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.960
A network of balloons in the stratosphere

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.896
that beam an internet connection down
to rural and remote areas of the world.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.816
This could bring online
as many as four billion more people,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.080
who today have little
or no internet connection.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.015
But you can't just take a cell tower,

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.936
strap it to a balloon
and stick it in the sky.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.336
The winds are too strong,
it would be blown away.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.760
And the balloons are too high up
to tie it to the ground.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.240
Here comes the crazy moment.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.096
What if, instead,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.336
we let the balloons drift

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.200
and we taught them how to sail the winds
to go where the needed to go?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.896
It turns out the stratosphere has winds

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.016
that are going in quite different
speeds and directions in thin strata.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.920
So we hoped that using smart algorithms
and wind data from around the world,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.256
we could maneuver the balloons a bit,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.376
getting them to go up and down
just a tiny bit in the stratosphere

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.016
to grab those winds going
in those different directions and speeds.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.336
The idea is to have enough balloons

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.216
so as one balloon floats out of your area,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.976
there's another balloon
ready to float into place,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.616
handing off the internet connection,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.096
just like your phone
hands off between cell towers

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.760
as you drive down the freeway.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.176
We get how crazy that vision sounds --

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.936
there's the name of the project
to remind us of that.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.296
So since 2012,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.096
the Loon team has prioritized
the work that seems the most difficult

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.960
and so the most likely
to kill their project.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.456
The first thing that they did

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.696
was try to get a Wi-Fi connection
from a balloon in the stratosphere

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.840
down to an antenna on the ground.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.936
It worked.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.675
And I promise you there were bets
that it wasn't going to.

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:27.939
So we kept going.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.256
Could we get the balloon
to talk directly to handsets,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.640
so that we didn't need the antenna
as an intermediary receiver?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.920
Yeah.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.296
Could we get the balloon
bandwidth high enough

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.056
so it was a real Internet connection?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.040
So that people could have
something more than just SMS?

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.456
The early tests weren't even
a megabit per second,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.896
but now we can do
up to 15 megabits per second.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.240
Enough to watch a TED Talk.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.936
Could we get the balloons
to talk to each other through the sky

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.816
so that we could reach our signal
deeper into rural areas?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.376
Check.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:16.056
Could we get balloons the size of a house
to stay up for more than 100 days,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.376
while costing less than five percent

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.960
of what traditional, long-life
balloons have cost to make?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.536
Yes. In the end.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.600
But I promise you, you name it,
we had to try it to get there.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.320
We made round, silvery balloons.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.640
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.280
We made balloons the size of a blue whale.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.376
We busted a lot of balloons.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.016
(Laughter)

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.096
Since one of the things that was
most likely to kill the Loon project

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.176
was whether we could guide
the balloons through the sky,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.960
one of our most important experiments
was putting a balloon inside a balloon.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.080
So there are two compartments here,
one with air and then one with helium.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.216
The balloon pumps air in
to make itself heavier,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.600
or lets air out to make it lighter.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.816
And these weight changes
allow it to rise or fall,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.576
and that simple movement of the balloon
is its steering mechanism.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.256
It floats up or down,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.200
hoping to grab winds going in the speed
and direction that it wants.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.120
But is that good enough
for it to navigate through the world?

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.336
Barely at first,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.736
but better all the time.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.840
This particular balloon,
our latest balloon,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.240
can navigate a two-mile
vertical stretch of sky

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.336
and can sail itself to within 500 meters
of where it wants to go

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.960
from 20,000 kilometers away.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.576
We have lots more to do

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.176
in terms of fine-tuning
the system and reducing costs.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.216
But last year,
a balloon built inexpensively

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:12.376
went around the world
19 times over 187 days.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.840
So we're going to keep going.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.440
(Applause)

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.776
Our balloons today

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.160
are doing pretty much everything
a complete system needs to do.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.016
We're in discussions
with telcos around the world,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.376
and we're going to fly
over places like Indonesia

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.136
for real service testing this year.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.720
This probably all sounds
too good to be true,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.000
and you're right.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.056
Being audacious

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.736
and working on big, risky things

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.240
makes people inherently uncomfortable.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.120
You cannot yell at people
and force them to fail fast.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.536
People resist. They worry.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.616
"What will happen to me if I fail?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.120
Will people laugh at me?

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.320
Will I be fired?"

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.576
I started with our secret.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.480
I'm going to leave you
with how we actually make it happen.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.936
The only way to get people
to work on big, risky things --

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.696
audacious ideas --

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.656
and have them run at all
the hardest parts of the problem first,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.560
is if you make that the path
of least resistance for them.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.240
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.936
Teams kill their ideas
as soon as the evidence is on the table

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.520
because they're rewarded for it.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.976
They get applause from their peers.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.880
Hugs and high fives
from their manager, me in particular.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.656
They get promoted for it.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.936
We have bonused every single person
on teams that ended their projects,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.976
from teams as small as two
to teams of more than 30.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.920
We believe in dreams
at the moonshot factory.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.336
But enthusiastic skepticism

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.816
is not the enemy of boundless optimism.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.520
It's optimism's perfect partner.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.600
It unlocks the potential in every idea.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.480
We can create the future
that's in our dreams.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.696
Thank you very much.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.742
(Applause)
