00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.932
You'll be happy to know that
I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:31.257
but other people's tragedy.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:34.350
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted
about other people's tragedy

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:35.525
than your own,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.276
and I want to keep it
in the spirit of the conference.

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.238
So, if you believe the media accounts,

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:46.815
being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.665
was a very glamorous life,
in the words of Virginia Postrel.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:54.868
There was money,
there was drugs, guns, women,

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:58.380
you know, you name it -- jewelry,
bling-bling -- it had it all.

00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:04.645
What I'm going to tell you today is that,
in fact, based on 10 years of research,

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.128
a unique opportunity
to go inside a gang --

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:10.060
to see the actual books,
the financial records of the gang --

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.452
that the answer turns out not to be

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.976
that being in the gang
was a glamorous life.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.751
But I think, more realistically,
that being in a gang --

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:22.681
selling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps
the worst job in all of America.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.570
And that's what I'd like
to convince you of today.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:27.505
So there are three things I want to do.

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:31.237
First, I want to explain
how and why crack cocaine

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.318
had such a profound influence
on inner-city gangs.

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.601
Secondly, I want to tell you

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:43.501
how somebody like me
came to be able to see

00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:46.882
the inner workings of a gang --
an interesting story, I think.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.816
And then third, I want to tell you,
in a very superficial way,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.427
about some of the things we found

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:54.015
when we actually got to look
at the financial records,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.727
the books, of the gang.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.180
So before I do that, just one warning,

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:02.938
which is that this presentation
has been rated 'R'

00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:05.236
by the Motion Picture
Association of America.

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:08.331
It contains adult themes, adult language.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.410
Given who is up on the stage,
you'll be delighted to know

00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:13.976
that, in fact, there'll be no nudity --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.393
(Laughter)

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:19.000
Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.

00:02:19.024 --> 00:02:23.938
(Laughter)

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:27.495
So let me start by talking
about crack cocaine,

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.193
and how it transformed the gang.

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.905
To do that, you have to actually go
back to a time before crack cocaine,

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.339
in the early '80s, and look at it
from the perspective of a gang leader.

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:42.303
Being a gang leader in the inner city
wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --

00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:43.820
the early '80s, let me say.

00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:46.743
Now, you had a lot of power,
and you got to beat people up --

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.299
you got a lot of prestige,
a lot of respect.

00:02:49.323 --> 00:02:51.876
But the thing is,
there was no money in it.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.561
The gang had no way to make money.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:55.987
You couldn't charge dues
to the people in the gang,

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.621
because the people in the gang
didn't have any money.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.253
You couldn't really make any money
selling marijuana --

00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:03.673
marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:05.563
You can't get rich selling marijuana.

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:07.378
You couldn't sell cocaine;

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:09.816
cocaine's a great product --
powdered cocaine --

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.806
but you've got to know rich white people.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.323
And most of the inner-city gang members
didn't know any rich white people,

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:16.886
so couldn't sell to that market.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.930
You couldn't really do
petty crime, either.

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:21.629
Turns out, petty crime's
a terrible way to make a living.

00:03:21.653 --> 00:03:24.808
As a result, as a gang leader,
you had, you know, power --

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:27.523
it's a pretty good life --
but the thing was, in the end,

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:29.514
you were living at home with your mother.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:31.221
And so it wasn't really a career.

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.083
There were limits to how powerful
and important you could be

00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:36.179
if you had to live at home
with your mother.

00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:38.913
Then along comes crack cocaine.

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.321
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:46.776
crack cocaine was the extra-chunky
version of tomato sauce

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.951
for the inner city.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:48.976
(Laughter)

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.504
Because crack cocaine
was an unbelievable innovation.

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:54.749
I don't have time to talk about it today,
but if you think about it,

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:56.616
I would say that in the last 25 years,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.776
of every invention or innovation
that's occurred in this country,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.579
the biggest one in terms of impact

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:05.469
on the well-being of people
who live in the inner city,

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:06.644
was crack cocaine.

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:09.449
And for the worse --
not for the better, but for the worse.

00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:10.927
It had a huge impact on life.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.815
So what was it about crack cocaine?

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:17.410
It was a brilliant way
of getting the brain high.

00:04:17.434 --> 00:04:22.976
Because you could smoke crack cocaine --
you can't smoke powdered cocaine --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.385
and smoking is a much more efficient
mechanism of delivering a high

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.912
than snorting it.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:32.385
And it turned out there was this audience
that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.181
but when it came, it really did.

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:35.610
And it was a perfect drug;

00:04:35.634 --> 00:04:39.810
you could buy the cocaine
that went into it for a dollar,

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:41.319
sell it for five dollars.

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:43.671
Highly addictive --
the high was very short.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.367
So for fifteen minutes,
you get this great high,

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.748
and then when you come down,

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:50.468
all you want to do is get high again.

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:52.382
It created a wonderful market.

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:55.538
And for the people who were there
running the gang,

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.976
it was a great way, seemingly,
to make a lot of money.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.185
At least for the people on the top.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.067
So this is where we enter the picture.

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:05.596
Not really me -- I'm really
a bit player in all this.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.485
My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh,
is the main character.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.976
He was a math major in college
who had a good heart,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.761
and decided he wanted
to get a sociology PhD,

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:18.414
came to the University of Chicago.

00:05:18.438 --> 00:05:21.068
Now, the three months
before he came to Chicago,

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:23.623
he had spent following the Grateful Dead.

00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:27.114
And in his own words,
he "looked like a freak."

00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:31.000
He's a South Asian --
very dark-skinned South Asian.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.096
Big man, and he had hair,
in his words, "down to his ass."

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.514
Defied all kinds of boundaries:

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:39.776
Was he black or white?
Was he man or woman?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.467
He was really a curious sight to be seen.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.135
So he showed up
at the University of Chicago,

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.842
and the famous sociologist
William Julius Wilson

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:53.000
was doing a book that involved
surveying people all across Chicago.

00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:57.138
He took one look at Sudhir, who was going
to go do some surveys for him,

00:05:57.162 --> 00:05:59.532
and decided he knew exactly
the place to send him,

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:02.680
which was to one of the toughest,
most notorious housing projects

00:06:02.704 --> 00:06:05.195
not just in Chicago,
but in the entire United States.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.888
So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never
really been in the inner city,

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.815
dutifully took his clipboard
and walked down to this housing project,

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.378
gets to the first building.

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.240
The first building?
Well, there's nobody there.

00:06:18.264 --> 00:06:21.394
But he hears some voices
up in the stairwell,

00:06:21.418 --> 00:06:24.976
so he climbs up the stairwell,
comes around the corner,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.081
and finds a group of young
African-American men playing dice.

00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:33.272
This is about 1990,
peak of the crack epidemic.

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:35.454
This is a very dangerous job,
being in a gang.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.993
You don't like to be surprised.

00:06:37.017 --> 00:06:40.530
You don't like to be surprised
by people who come around the corner.

00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:43.878
And the mantra was:
shoot first; ask questions later.

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.084
Now, Sudhir was lucky --
he was such a freak,

00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:48.319
and that clipboard
probably saved his life,

00:06:48.343 --> 00:06:50.566
because they figured no other
rival gang member

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.085
would be coming up to shoot
at them with a clipboard.

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:54.110
(Laughter)

00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:57.165
So his greeting was not particularly
warm, but they did say,

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.832
well, OK -- let's hear
your questions on your survey.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.465
So -- I kid you not --

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:06.276
the first question on the survey
that he was sent to ask was:

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.006
"How do you feel about being
poor and Black in America?"

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.161
(Laughter)

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:13.876
Makes you wonder about academics.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.804
(Laughter)

00:07:15.828 --> 00:07:17.709
So the choice of answers were:

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:21.380
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]

00:07:21.404 --> 00:07:23.405
(Laughter)

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:26.934
What Sudhir found out is, in fact,
that the real answer was the following:

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.833
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad
D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]

00:07:29.857 --> 00:07:31.454
(Laughter)

00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:34.998
The survey was not, in the end, going
to be what got Sudhir off the hook.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:38.502
He was held hostage
overnight in the stairwell.

00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:39.831
There was a lot of gunfire,

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:43.474
there were a lot of philosophical
discussions he had with the gang members.

00:07:43.498 --> 00:07:45.248
By morning, the gang leader arrived,

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:47.390
checked out Sudhir,
decided he was no threat,

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:48.636
and they let him go home.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.788
So Sudhir went home,
took a shower, took a nap.

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:56.611
And you and I, probably, faced
with the situation, would think,

00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:59.707
"I guess I'm going to write
my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:02.170
I've been following them
for the last three months."

00:08:02.194 --> 00:08:03.202
(Laughter)

00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:04.485
Sudhir, on the other hand,

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:06.930
got right back, walked
down to the housing project,

00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:08.297
went up to the second floor,

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.223
and said: "Hey, guys, I had so much fun
hanging out with you last night,

00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:14.225
I wonder if I could do it again tonight."

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:17.880
And that was the beginning of what turned
out to be a beautiful relationship

00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:21.499
that involved Sudhir living in the housing
project on and off for 10 years,

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:26.278
hanging out in crack houses,
going to jail with the gang members,

00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:28.840
having the windows shot out of his car,

00:08:28.864 --> 00:08:32.362
having the police break into his apartment
and steal his computer disks --

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:33.544
you name it.

00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:36.384
But ultimately, the story
has a happy ending for Sudhir,

00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:39.651
who became one of the most
respected sociologists in the country.

00:08:39.675 --> 00:08:41.044
And especially for me,

00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:44.487
as I sat in my office
with my Excel spreadsheet open,

00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.848
waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver
to me the latest load of data

00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.758
that he would get from the gang.

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:53.551
(Laughter)

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:56.979
It was one of the most unequal
co-authoring relationships ever --

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.023
(Laughter)

00:08:58.047 --> 00:09:01.538
But I was glad to be
the beneficiary of it.

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:02.936
So what did we find?

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.341
What did we find in the gang?

00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:07.457
Well, let me say one thing:

00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:11.084
We really got access
to everybody in the gang.

00:09:11.108 --> 00:09:15.432
We got an inside look at the gang,
from the very bottom up to the very top.

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:20.442
They trusted Sudhir, in ways
that really no academic has ever --

00:09:20.466 --> 00:09:25.018
or really anybody, any outsider --
has ever earned the trust of these gangs,

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.499
to the point where they actually opened up

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:29.780
what was most interesting
for me -- their books,

00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:31.343
the financial records they kept.

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:34.439
They made them available to us,
and we not only could study them,

00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:37.059
but we could ask them questions
about what was in them.

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:40.509
So if I have to kind of summarize
very quickly in the short time I have

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:44.483
what the bottom line of what
I take away from the gang is,

00:09:44.507 --> 00:09:47.217
it's that, if I had to draw
a parallel between the gang

00:09:47.241 --> 00:09:49.360
and any other organization,

00:09:49.384 --> 00:09:52.675
it would be that the gang
is just like McDonald's,

00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:55.548
in a lot of different respects --
the restaurant McDonald's.

00:09:55.572 --> 00:09:57.190
So first, in one way,

00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:00.829
which isn't maybe the most interesting
way, but it's a good way to start --

00:10:00.853 --> 00:10:03.499
is in the way it's organized,
the hierarchy of the gang,

00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:04.674
the way it looks.

00:10:04.698 --> 00:10:07.152
So here's what the org chart
of the gang looks like.

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:09.383
I don't know if you know much
about org charts,

00:10:09.407 --> 00:10:13.114
but if you were to assign a stripped-down
and simplified McDonald's org chart,

00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:15.092
this is exactly what it would look like.

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.310
It's amazing, but the top
level of the gang,

00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:19.961
they actually call themselves
the "Board of Directors."

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:21.064
(Laughter)

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:23.035
And Sudhir says

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:26.453
it's not like these guys
had a very sophisticated view

00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:29.942
of what happened
in American corporate life,

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:32.031
but they had seen movies
like "Wall Street,"

00:10:32.055 --> 00:10:35.430
and they had learned a little bit
about what it was like

00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:37.405
to be in the real world.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.263
Now, below that board of directors,

00:10:39.287 --> 00:10:41.692
you've got essentially
what are regional VPs --

00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:45.501
people who control, say, the South Side
of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:48.976
Sudhir got to know very well the guy
who had the unfortunate assignment

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.339
of trying to take the Iowa franchise,

00:10:51.363 --> 00:10:53.424
which, it turned out, for this black gang,

00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:57.546
was not one of the more brilliant
financial endeavors they undertook.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.824
(Laughter)

00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:03.144
But the thing that really makes the gang
seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:07.508
The guys who are running
the local gangs --

00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:10.483
the four-square-block
by four-square-block areas --

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:14.009
they're just like the guys, in some sense,
who are running the McDonald's.

00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.502
They are the entrepreneurs.

00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:19.262
They get the exclusive property rights
to control the drug-selling.

00:11:19.286 --> 00:11:25.798
They get the name of the gang behind them,
for merchandising and marketing.

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:29.639
And they're the ones who basically
make the profit or lose a profit,

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:32.242
depending on how good
they are at running the business.

00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:35.171
Now, the group I really want you
to think about, though,

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.448
are the ones at the bottom --
the foot soldiers.

00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:39.520
These are the teenagers, typically,

00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:42.568
who'd be standing out on the street
corner, selling the drugs.

00:11:42.592 --> 00:11:45.012
Extremely dangerous work.

00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:50.414
And important to note is that almost all
of the weight, all of the people

00:11:50.438 --> 00:11:53.495
in this organization are at the bottom --
just like McDonald's.

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.479
So in some sense, the foot soldiers
are a lot like the people

00:11:56.503 --> 00:11:58.469
who are taking your order at McDonald's,

00:11:58.493 --> 00:12:00.931
and it's not just by chance
that they're like them.

00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:03.756
In fact, in these neighborhoods,
they'd be the same people.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.681
So the same kids who are working
in the gang were actually,

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:09.464
at the very same time,
typically working part-time

00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:11.019
at a place like McDonald's.

00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:14.434
Which already foreshadows
the main result that I've talked about,

00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:17.548
about what a crappy job
it was, being in the gang.

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:21.223
Because obviously, if being in the gang
were such a wonderful, lucrative job,

00:12:21.247 --> 00:12:24.491
why in the world would these guys
moonlight at McDonald's?

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:27.563
So what do the wages look like?
You might be surprised.

00:12:27.587 --> 00:12:31.214
But based on being able to talk to them
and to see their records,

00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:33.708
this is what it looks
like in terms of the wages.

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:37.822
The hourly wage the foot soldiers
were earning was $3.50 an hour.

00:12:37.846 --> 00:12:41.235
It was below the minimum wage.
And this is well-documented.

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:44.122
It's easy to see by the patterns
of consumption they have.

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:47.121
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:50.976
There was very little money in the gang,
especially at the bottom.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.385
Now if you managed to rise up, say,
and be that local leader,

00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:57.146
the guy who's the equivalent
of the McDonald's franchisee,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.055
you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:02.405
And that, in some ways,
was the best job you could hope to get

00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:06.087
if you were growing up in one of these
neighborhoods as a young black male.

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.006
If you managed to rise to the very top,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.955
200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year
is what you'd hope to make.

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:13.708
Truly, you would be a great success story.

00:13:13.732 --> 00:13:16.808
And one of the sad parts
of this is that, indeed,

00:13:16.832 --> 00:13:19.377
among the many other
ramifications of crack cocaine

00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:23.531
is that the most talented individuals
in these communities --

00:13:23.555 --> 00:13:25.286
this is what they were striving for.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.778
They weren't trying to make it
in legitimate ways,

00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:29.992
because there were
no legitimate channels out.

00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:31.389
This was the best way out.

00:13:31.413 --> 00:13:34.084
And it actually was
the right choice, probably,

00:13:34.108 --> 00:13:37.434
to try to make it out this way.

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.401
You look at this,

00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:42.344
the relationship to McDonald's
breaks down here.

00:13:42.368 --> 00:13:44.303
The money looks about the same.

00:13:44.327 --> 00:13:45.769
Why is it such a bad job?

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:49.509
Well, the reason it's such a bad job
is that there's somebody shooting at you

00:13:49.533 --> 00:13:51.095
a lot of the time.

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:53.976
So, with shooting at you,
what are the death rates?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.157
We found, in our gang --

00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:58.417
and admittedly, this was not really
a standard situation;

00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:02.883
this was a time of intense violence,
of a lot of gang wars,

00:14:02.907 --> 00:14:05.566
as this gang actually
became quite successful.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.826
But there were costs.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.595
And so the death rate --

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:13.579
not to mention the rate of being arrested,
sent to prison, being wounded --

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:18.308
the death rate in our sample
was seven percent per person per year.

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:20.063
You're in the gang for four years,

00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:24.603
you expect to die
with about a 25 percent likelihood.

00:14:24.627 --> 00:14:26.729
That is about as high as you can get.

00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:28.600
So for comparison's purposes,

00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:33.626
let's think about some other walk of life
you may expect might be extremely risky.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.642
Let's say that you were a murderer

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.867
and you were convicted of murder,
and you're sent to death row.

00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.860
It turns out, the death rates on death row
from all causes, including execution:

00:14:42.884 --> 00:14:44.040
two percent a year.

00:14:44.064 --> 00:14:45.065
(Laughter)

00:14:45.089 --> 00:14:48.722
So it's a lot safer being on death row

00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:51.306
than it is selling drugs
out on the street.

00:14:51.844 --> 00:14:54.722
That gives you some pause,
for those of you who believe

00:14:54.746 --> 00:14:59.429
that a death penalty's going to have
an enormous deterrent effect on crime.

00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:03.871
To give you a sense of just how bad
the inner city was during crack --

00:15:03.895 --> 00:15:06.629
and I'm not really focusing
on the negatives,

00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:09.573
but really, there's another story
to tell you there --

00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:13.335
if you look at the death rates
just of random, young black males

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:15.746
growing up in the inner city
in the United States,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.546
the death rates during crack
were about one percent.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.722
That's extremely high.

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:22.737
And this is violent death --
it's unbelievable, in some sense.

00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:27.491
To put it into perspective: if you compare
this to the soldiers in Iraq,

00:15:27.515 --> 00:15:31.181
for instance, right now
fighting the war: 0.5 percent.

00:15:31.205 --> 00:15:34.242
So in some very literal way,

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:37.174
the young black men who were
growing up in this country

00:15:37.198 --> 00:15:39.011
were living in a war zone,

00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:45.805
very much in the sense that the soldiers
over in Iraq are fighting in a war.

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:48.844
So why in the world, you might ask,

00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:52.663
would anybody be willing
to stand out on a street corner

00:15:52.687 --> 00:15:54.976
selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.976
with a 25 percent chance of dying
over the next four years?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.935
Why would they do that?

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.330
And I think there are a couple answers.

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:08.164
I think the first one
is that they got fooled by history.

00:16:08.513 --> 00:16:10.830
It used to be the gang
was a rite of passage;

00:16:10.854 --> 00:16:12.888
that the young people controlled the gang;

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:15.597
that as you got older,
you dropped out of the gang.

00:16:16.463 --> 00:16:17.639
So what happened was,

00:16:17.663 --> 00:16:20.941
the people who happened to be
in the right place at the right time --

00:16:20.965 --> 00:16:26.381
the people who happened to be leading
the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --

00:16:26.405 --> 00:16:28.364
became very, very wealthy.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.492
And so the logical thing to think

00:16:30.516 --> 00:16:33.640
was that they are going
to age out of the gang

00:16:33.664 --> 00:16:34.861
like everybody else has,

00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:38.000
and the next generation is going
to take over and get the wealth.

00:16:38.024 --> 00:16:41.009
There are striking similarities,
I think, to the Internet boom.

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:44.259
The first set of people in Silicon Valley
got very, very rich.

00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:48.373
And then all of my friends said,
"Maybe I should go do that, too."

00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:53.001
And they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came.

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.399
In some sense,
that's what happened, exactly,

00:16:55.423 --> 00:16:58.937
to the set of people we were looking at.

00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:01.156
They were willing to start at the bottom,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.237
just like, say, a first-year
lawyer at a law firm

00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:06.432
is willing to start at the bottom,

00:17:06.456 --> 00:17:08.519
work 80-hour weeks
for not that much money,

00:17:08.543 --> 00:17:10.852
because they think
they're going to make partner.

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:13.662
But the rules changed,
and they never got to make partner.

00:17:13.686 --> 00:17:17.545
Indeed, the same people who were running
all of the major gangs in the late 1980s

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.975
are still running the major gangs
in Chicago today.

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.882
They never passed on any of the wealth,

00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:24.750
So everybody got stuck
at that $3.50-an-hour job,

00:17:24.774 --> 00:17:26.693
and it turned out to be a disaster.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.573
The other thing the gang was
very good at was marketing and trickery.

00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:35.245
And so for instance,
one thing the gang would do is --

00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:37.501
the gang leaders would have
big entourages,

00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:40.737
and they'd drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry.

00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:43.847
So what Sudhir eventually realized
as he hung out with them more,

00:17:43.871 --> 00:17:47.131
is that, really, they didn't own
those cars -- they just leased them,

00:17:47.155 --> 00:17:49.834
because they couldn't afford
to own the fancy cars.

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:53.320
And they didn't really have gold jewelry,
they had gold-plated jewelry.

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:56.704
It goes back to, you know,
the real-real versus the fake-real.

00:17:56.728 --> 00:18:00.690
And really, they did all sorts
of things to trick the young people

00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:03.507
into thinking what a great deal
the gang was going to be.

00:18:03.531 --> 00:18:06.322
So for instance, they would give
a 14-year-old kid

00:18:06.346 --> 00:18:09.472
a whole roll of bills to hold.

00:18:09.496 --> 00:18:12.326
That 14-year-old kid
would say to his friends,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.557
"Hey, look at all the money
I got in the gang."

00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:16.558
It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,

00:18:16.582 --> 00:18:18.301
and then he was in debt to the gang,

00:18:18.325 --> 00:18:20.714
and was sort of an indentured
servant for a while.

00:18:20.738 --> 00:18:22.288
So I have a couple minutes.

00:18:22.312 --> 00:18:26.357
Let me do one last thing
I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,

00:18:26.381 --> 00:18:31.635
which is to talk about what we learned
more generally about economics,

00:18:31.659 --> 00:18:33.666
from the study of the gang.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.245
So, economists tend to talk
in technical words.

00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:40.870
Often, our theories fail quite miserably
when we over the data,

00:18:40.894 --> 00:18:43.680
but what's kind of interesting
is that in this setting,

00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:46.021
it turned out that
some of the economic theories

00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:48.180
that worked not so well
in the real economy

00:18:48.204 --> 00:18:50.394
worked very well in the drug economy,

00:18:50.418 --> 00:18:52.784
in some sense, because
it's unfettered capitalism.

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:54.201
Here's an economic principle.

00:18:54.225 --> 00:18:56.567
This is one of the basic ideas
in labor economics,

00:18:56.591 --> 00:18:58.375
called a "compensating differential."

00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:01.841
It's the idea that the increment to wages
that a worker requires

00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:04.479
to leave him indifferent
between performing two tasks,

00:19:04.503 --> 00:19:06.608
one which is more unpleasant
than the other.

00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:10.278
Compensating differential -- it's why
we think garbagemen might be paid more

00:19:10.302 --> 00:19:11.836
than people who work in parks.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:17.782
The words of one of the members
of the gang, I think, make this clear.

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:20.496
So it turns out -- I'm sort
of getting ahead of myself --

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.673
it turns out, in the gang,
when there's a war going on,

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:26.714
they actually pay the foot soldiers
twice as much money.

00:19:26.738 --> 00:19:28.027
It's exactly this concept.

00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:30.683
Because they're not willing to be at risk.

00:19:30.707 --> 00:19:33.729
And the words of a gang member
capture it quite nicely, he says:

00:19:33.753 --> 00:19:37.103
"Would you stand around here when all
this shit ..." -- the shooting --

00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:39.240
"... if all this shit's
going on? No, right?

00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:43.070
So if I gonna be asked to put my life
on the line, then front me the cash, man."

00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:45.642
I think the gang member says it
much more articulately

00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.683
than the economist, about what's going on.

00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:49.322
(Laughter)

00:19:49.346 --> 00:19:50.976
Here's another one.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.642
Economists talk about game theory,

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:55.024
that every two-person game
has a Nash equilibrium.

00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:57.506
Here's the translation
you get from the gang member.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.883
They're talking about the decision
of why they don't go shoot --

00:20:00.907 --> 00:20:04.773
One thing that turns out to be a great
business tactic in the gang:

00:20:04.797 --> 00:20:08.679
if you go and just shoot guns in the air
in the other gang's territory --

00:20:08.703 --> 00:20:10.644
people are afraid to go buy drugs there,

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:12.776
they're going to come
into your neighborhood.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.096
Here's what he says
about why they don't do that:

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.141
"If we start shooting around there,
the other gang's territory,

00:20:18.165 --> 00:20:21.048
nobody, I mean, you dig it,
nobody gonna step on their turf.

00:20:21.072 --> 00:20:22.224
But we gotta be careful,

00:20:22.248 --> 00:20:25.174
'cause they can shoot around here too
and then we all fucked."

00:20:25.198 --> 00:20:26.199
(Laughter)

00:20:26.223 --> 00:20:27.521
So that's the same concept.

00:20:27.545 --> 00:20:29.759
Then again, sometimes
economists get it wrong.

00:20:29.783 --> 00:20:34.454
One thing we observed in the data
is that it looked like --

00:20:34.478 --> 00:20:37.758
the gang leader always got paid.

00:20:37.782 --> 00:20:42.234
No matter how bad it was economically,
he always got himself paid.

00:20:42.258 --> 00:20:44.408
We had some theories related to cash flow,

00:20:44.432 --> 00:20:47.263
and lack of access to capital markets,
and things like that.

00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.723
Then we asked the gang member,

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:52.100
"Why is it you always get paid
and your workers don't always get paid?"

00:20:52.124 --> 00:20:53.275
His response is,

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:56.386
"You got all these niggers below you
who want your job, you dig?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.193
If you start taking losses,
they see you as weak and shit."

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.765
And I thought about it and said,

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:04.430
"CEOs often pay themselves
million-dollar bonuses,

00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:06.766
even when companies
are losing a lot of money.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.005
And it never would really occur
to an economist

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:11.925
that this idea of 'weak and shit'
could really be important."

00:21:11.949 --> 00:21:15.215
(Laughter)

00:21:15.239 --> 00:21:20.976
Maybe "weak and shit" is an important
hypothesis that needs more analysis.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.151
Thank you very much.

00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:23.175
(Applause)
