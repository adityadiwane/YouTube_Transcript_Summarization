00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.497
"When the crisis came,

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.207
the serious limitations
of existing economic and financial models

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.127
immediately became apparent."

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.609
"There is also a strong belief,
which I share,

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:36.597
that bad or oversimplistic
and overconfident economics

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.526
helped create the crisis."

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.107
Now, you've probably all heard
of similar criticism

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.134
coming from people
who are skeptical of capitalism.

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:45.977
But this is different.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.680
This is coming from the heart of finance.

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:52.604
The first quote
is from Jean-Claude Trichet

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:55.490
when he was governor
of the European Central Bank.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.180
The second quote is from the head
of the UK Financial Services Authority.

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:03.822
Are these people implying

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:06.586
that we don't understand
the economic systems

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.949
that drive our modern societies?

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:10.929
It gets worse.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.893
"We spend billions of dollars

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:17.794
trying to understand
the origins of the universe,

00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:23.773
while we still don't understand
the conditions for a stable society,

00:01:23.797 --> 00:01:27.446
a functioning economy, or peace."

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:32.209
What's happening here?
How can this be possible?

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.480
Do we really understand more
about the fabric of reality

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.465
than we do about the fabric
which emerges from our human interactions?

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.792
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:45.234
But there's an intriguing solution

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:49.496
which is coming from what is known
as the science of complexity.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:53.732
To explain what this means
and what this thing is,

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:56.369
please let me quickly take
a couple of steps back.

00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:59.449
I ended up in physics by accident.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.587
It was a random encounter
when I was young,

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:07.205
and since then, I've often wondered
about the amazing success of physics

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.128
in describing the reality
we wake up in every day.

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:14.140
In a nutshell, you can think
of physics as follows.

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:17.173
So you take a chunk of reality
you want to understand

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:20.942
and you translate it into mathematics.

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.384
You encode it into equations.

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:26.804
Then, predictions can be made and tested.

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:30.872
We're actually
really lucky that this works,

00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:33.784
because no one really knows
why the thoughts in our heads

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.615
should actually relate to the fundamental
workings of the universe.

00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.408
Despite the success,
physics has its limits.

00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:45.998
As Dirk Helbing pointed out
in the last quote,

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:50.880
we don't really understand the complexity
that relates to us, that surrounds us.

00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:55.965
This paradox is what got me interested
in complex systems.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.865
So these are systems which are made up

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.349
of many interconnected
or interacting parts:

00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:04.182
swarms of birds or fish,

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:08.757
ant colonies, ecosystems,
brains, financial markets.

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:10.530
These are just a few examples.

00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:18.166
Interestingly, complex systems
are very hard to map

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.189
into mathematical equations,

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:23.848
so the usual physics approach
doesn't really work here.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:26.712
So what do we know about complex systems?

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:32.768
Well, it turns out that what looks
like complex behavior from the outside

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:36.503
is actually the result
of a few simple rules of interaction.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:42.095
This means you can forget
about the equations

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.845
and just start to understand the system

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.588
by looking at the interactions,

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:48.982
so you can actually forget
about the equations

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.558
and you just start to look
at the interactions.

00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:54.916
And it gets even better,
because most complex systems

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.420
have this amazing property
called emergence.

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.149
So this means that the system as a whole
suddenly starts to show a behavior

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:05.045
which cannot be understood or predicted

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.622
by looking at the components
of the system.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.947
So the whole is literally
more than the sum of its parts.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.193
And all of this also means

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:18.081
that you can forget about
the individual parts of the system,

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:19.426
how complex they are.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.438
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:26.703
you just focus on the rules
of interaction.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.877
As a result, networks are ideal
representations of complex systems.

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:40.880
The nodes in the network
are the system's components,

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:44.523
and the links are given
by the interactions.

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:48.153
So what equations are for physics,

00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:51.657
complex networks are for the study
of complex systems.

00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:56.134
This approach has been
very successfully applied

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:59.752
to many complex systems
in physics, biology,

00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:02.496
computer science, the social sciences,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.778
but what about economics?

00:05:04.817 --> 00:05:06.619
Where are economic networks?

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.984
This is a surprising
and prominent gap in the literature.

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:18.073
The study we published last year, called
"The Network of Global Corporate Control,"

00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:22.734
was the first extensive analysis
of economic networks.

00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:26.476
The study went viral on the Internet

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.891
and it attracted a lot of attention
from the international media.

00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:35.725
This is quite remarkable, because, again,
why did no one look at this before?

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.808
Similar data has been
around for quite some time.

00:05:38.832 --> 00:05:42.011
What we looked at in detail
was ownership networks.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.979
So here the nodes are companies,
people, governments, foundations, etc.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.268
And the links represent
the shareholding relations,

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:59.456
so shareholder A has x percent
of the shares in company B.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.655
And we also assign a value to the company
given by the operating revenue.

00:06:05.038 --> 00:06:09.582
So ownership networks reveal the patterns
of shareholding relations.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:15.430
In this little example,
you can see a few financial institutions

00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:17.784
with some of the many links highlighted.

00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:21.950
Now, you may think that no one
looked at this before

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:26.461
because ownership networks
are really, really boring to study.

00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:31.267
Well, as ownership is related to control,

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.824
as I shall explain later,

00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:34.265
looking at ownership networks

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.967
actually can give you
answers to questions like,

00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:38.440
who are the key players?

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.790
How are they organized?
Are they isolated?

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:42.459
Are they interconnected?

00:06:42.483 --> 00:06:45.209
And what is the overall
distribution of control?

00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:49.651
In other words, who controls the world?

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:52.017
I think this is an interesting question.

00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:55.020
And it has implications for systemic risk.

00:06:56.608 --> 00:07:00.828
This is a measure of how vulnerable
a system is overall.

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:05.794
A high degree of interconnectivity
can be bad for stability,

00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:11.513
because then the stress can spread
through the system like an epidemic.

00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:16.125
Scientists have sometimes
criticized economists

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:21.005
who believe ideas and concepts
are more important than empirical data,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.368
because a foundational
guideline in science is:

00:07:25.218 --> 00:07:27.851
Let the data speak. OK. Let's do that.

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:34.110
So we started with a database containing
13 million ownership relations from 2007.

00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:38.128
This is a lot of data,
and because we wanted to find out

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:40.260
"who rules the world,"

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:43.688
we decided to focus
on transnational corporations,

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:45.036
or "TNCs," for short.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.632
These are companies that operate
in more than one country,

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:50.497
and we found 43,000.

00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:55.369
In the next step, we built
the network around these companies,

00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:57.749
so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,

00:07:57.773 --> 00:07:59.732
and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,

00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:02.608
all the way upstream,
and we did the same downstream,

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.760
and ended up with a network
containing 600,000 nodes

00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:08.078
and one million links.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.061
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.

00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:14.620
And it turns out to be
structured as follows.

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:17.171
So you have a periphery and a center

00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:21.648
which contains about 75 percent
of all the players,

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:26.250
and in the center,
there's this tiny but dominant core

00:08:26.274 --> 00:08:29.413
which is made up of highly
interconnected companies.

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.642
To give you a better picture,

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:34.307
think about a metropolitan area.

00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:36.337
So you have the suburbs and the periphery,

00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:39.194
you have a center,
like a financial district,

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.944
then the core will be something like

00:08:40.968 --> 00:08:43.537
the tallest high-rise building
in the center.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:48.449
And we already see signs
of organization going on here.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.824
36 percent of the TNCs
are in the core only,

00:08:54.848 --> 00:09:00.932
but they make up 95 percent of the total
operating revenue of all TNCs.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.616
OK, so now we analyzed the structure,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.419
so how does this relate to the control?

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:12.423
Well, ownership gives
voting rights to shareholders.

00:09:12.447 --> 00:09:14.824
This is the normal notion of control.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.689
And there are different models

00:09:16.713 --> 00:09:20.178
which allow you to compute
the control you get from ownership.

00:09:21.178 --> 00:09:24.002
If you have more than 50 percent
of the shares in a company,

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:25.351
you get control,

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:29.045
but usually, it depends
on the relative distribution of shares.

00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:32.173
And the network really matters.

00:09:33.575 --> 00:09:36.500
About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera

00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:39.935
had ownership and control
in a small company,

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:42.768
which had ownership and control
in a bigger company.

00:09:43.146 --> 00:09:44.296
You get the idea.

00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:49.936
This ended up giving him control
in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.023
So this means that,
with each euro he invested,

00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:58.991
he was able to move 26 euros
of market value

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.183
through the chain of ownership relations.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:08.350
Now what we actually computed in our study
was the control over the TNCs' value.

00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:13.439
This allowed us to assign
a degree of influence to each shareholder.

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:19.190
This is very much in the sense
of Max Weber's idea of potential power,

00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:23.591
which is the probability
of imposing one's own will

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.598
despite the opposition of others.

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:32.423
If you want to compute the flow
in an ownership network,

00:10:32.447 --> 00:10:33.804
this is what you have to do.

00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:36.022
It's actually not that hard to understand.

00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:39.053
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:44.002
So think about water flowing in pipes,
where the pipes have different thickness.

00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:50.205
So similarly, the control is flowing
in the ownership networks

00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:52.316
and is accumulating at the nodes.

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:58.126
So what did we find after computing
all this network control?

00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:03.746
Well, it turns out
that the 737 top shareholders

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.340
have the potential to collectively control
80 percent of the TNCs' value.

00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:13.693
Now remember, we started out
with 600,000 nodes,

00:11:13.717 --> 00:11:20.400
so these 737 top players
make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:25.754
They're mostly financial institutions
in the US and the UK.

00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:28.101
And it gets even more extreme.

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:32.602
There are 146 top players in the core,

00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:37.441
and they together have the potential
to collectively control

00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:41.246
40 percent of the TNCs' value.

00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:45.615
What should you take home
from all of this?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:52.623
Well, the high degree of control you saw
is very extreme by any standard.

00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:59.420
The high degree of interconnectivity
of the top players in the core

00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:03.982
could pose a significant systemic risk
to the global economy.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.702
And we could easily
reproduce the TNC network

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.313
with a few simple rules.

00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:13.680
This means that its structure is probably
the result of self-organization.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.933
It's an emergent property which depends
on the rules of interaction in the system,

00:12:19.957 --> 00:12:23.772
so it's probably not the result
of a top-down approach

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:25.499
like a global conspiracy.

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:29.958
Our study "is an impression
of the moon's surface.

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.291
It's not a street map."

00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:35.125
So you should take the exact numbers
in our study with a grain of salt,

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:41.232
yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse
of a brave new world of finance."

00:12:43.448 --> 00:12:47.477
We hope to have opened the door
for more such research in this direction,

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:51.798
so the remaining unknown terrain
will be charted in the future.

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:53.877
And this is slowly starting.

00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:58.992
We're seeing the emergence of long-term
and highly-funded programs

00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:02.643
which aim at understanding
our networked world

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:04.397
from a complexity point of view.

00:13:05.121 --> 00:13:06.919
But this journey has only just begun,

00:13:06.943 --> 00:13:10.644
so we will have to wait
before we see the first results.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.849
Now there is still
a big problem, in my opinion.

00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:22.726
Ideas relating to finance,
economics, politics, society,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.695
are very often tainted
by people's personal ideologies.

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:32.236
I really hope that this
complexity perspective

00:13:32.857 --> 00:13:36.444
allows for some common ground to be found.

00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:40.474
It would be really great
if it has the power

00:13:40.498 --> 00:13:45.627
to help end the gridlock
created by conflicting ideas,

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:48.958
which appears to be paralyzing
our globalized world.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:54.579
Reality is so complex,
we need to move away from dogma.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.177
But this is just my own personal ideology.

00:13:58.201 --> 00:13:59.352
Thank you.

00:13:59.376 --> 00:14:05.648
(Applause)
