00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.855
The first time I stood
in the operating room

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:16.727
and watched a real surgery,

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:19.302
I had no idea what to expect.

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.277
I was a college student in engineering.

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:23.477
I thought it was going to be like on TV.

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.382
Ominous music playing in the background,

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:28.381
beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:30.541
But it wasn't like that at all.

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:32.140
There was music playing on this day,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.862
I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.989
And there was plenty of conversation,

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.989
not just about the patient's heart rate,

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.762
but about sports and weekend plans.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.698
And since then, the more surgeries I watched,

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.525
the more I realized this is how it is.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.278
In some weird way, it's just
another day at the office.

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:50.183
But every so often

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.281
the music gets turned down,

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:53.711
everyone stops talking,

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:56.695
and stares at exactly the same thing.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:58.855
And that's when you know
that something absolutely critical

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:01.295
and dangerous is happening.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.311
The first time I saw that

00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:03.543
I was watching a type of surgery

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.832
called laparoscopic surgery

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.390
And for those of you who are unfamiliar,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.783
laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:13.277
open incision you might
be used to with surgery,

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.485
a laparoscopic surgery
is where the surgeon creates

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.502
these three or more small
incisions in the patient.

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.368
And then inserts these long, thin instruments

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:22.482
and a camera,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.333
and actually does the procedure inside the patient.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.925
This is great because there's
much less risk of infection,

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:32.085
much less pain, shorter recovery time.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:34.677
But there is a trade-off,

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.461
because these incisions are created

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.959
with a long, pointed device

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.423
called a trocar.

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:42.617
And the way the surgeon uses this device

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.033
is that he takes it

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.000
and he presses it into the abdomen

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.255
until it punctures through.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:52.327
And now the reason why 
everyone in the operating room

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.974
was staring at that device on that day

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:58.205
was because he had to be absolutely careful

00:01:58.205 --> 00:01:59.672
not to plunge it through

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:03.613
and puncture it into the organs 
and blood vessels below.

00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:05.452
But this problem should seem 
pretty familiar to all of you

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:08.373
because I'm pretty sure 
you've seen it somewhere else.

00:02:08.373 --> 00:02:10.165
(Laughter)

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:11.821
Remember this?

00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:15.937
(Applause)

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:17.813
You knew that at any second

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:19.693
that straw was going to plunge through,

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.278
and you didn't know if it was 
going to go out the other side

00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:22.581
and straight into your hand,

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.277
or if you were going to
get juice everywhere,

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.580
but you were terrified. Right?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.556
Every single time you did this,

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:32.112
you experienced the same
fundamental physics

00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:35.192
that I was watching in the operating room that day.

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:37.738
And it turns out it really is a problem.

00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:40.530
In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.907
that trocar incisions might 
be the most dangerous step

00:02:43.907 --> 00:02:45.923
in minimally invasive surgery.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:48.363
Again in 2009, we see a paper that says

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:50.547
that trocars account for over half

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:54.234
of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.376
And, oh by the way,

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.970
this hasn't changed for 25 years.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.500
So when I got to graduate school,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.368
this is what I wanted to work on.

00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:04.176
I was trying to explain to a friend of mine

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:06.291
what exactly I was spending my time doing,

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.107
and I said,

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:10.283
"It's like when you're drilling through a wall

00:03:10.283 --> 00:03:13.483
to hang something in your apartment.

00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:17.395
There's that moment when the drill
first punctures through the wall

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.047
and there's this plunge. Right?

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.430
And he looked at me and he said,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.901
"You mean like when they drill 
into people's brains?"

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.233
And I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.281
And then I looked it up and they
do drill into people's brains.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.345
A lot of neurosurgical procedures

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:40.127
actually start with a drill
incision through the skull.

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:41.912
And if the surgeon isn't careful,

00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:45.496
he can plunge directly into the brain.

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:47.662
So this is the moment when I started thinking,

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:50.970
okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.634
why not other areas of medicine?

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:54.578
Because think about it, when was
the last time you went to the doctor

00:03:54.578 --> 00:03:57.325
and you didn't get stuck with something? Right?

00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:58.642
So the truth is

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:01.194
in medicine puncture is everywhere.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:03.986
And here are just a couple
of the procedures that I've found

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:07.195
that involve some tissue puncture step.

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:09.274
And if we take just three of them —

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:13.370
laparoscopic surgery, 
epidurals, and cranial drilling —

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.349
these procedures account 
for over 30,000 complications

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.200
every year in this country alone.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.915
I call that a problem worth solving.

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:25.240
So let's take a look at some of the devices

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.744
that are used in these types of procedures.

00:04:27.744 --> 00:04:30.969
I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.286
It's used to puncture through 
the ligaments in the spine

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.725
and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:38.278
Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.214
These are actually used
to burrow into the bone

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:43.714
and collect bone marrow
or sample bone lesions.

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.624
Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.

00:04:45.624 --> 00:04:48.640
(Laughter)

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.233
If I had told you it was a 
medical puncture device

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:53.449
you probably would have believed me.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.642
Because what's the difference?

00:04:55.642 --> 00:04:57.577
So, the more I did this research

00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.161
the more I thought there has to be

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.190
a better way to do this.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.609
And for me the key to this problem

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:06.020
is that all these different puncture devices

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.822
share a common set of fundamental physics.

00:05:09.822 --> 00:05:11.374
So what are those physics?

00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:12.966
Let's go back to drilling through a wall.

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:16.598
So you're applying a force 
on a drill towards the wall.

00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:19.942
And Newton says the wall
is going to apply force back,

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:21.207
equal and opposite.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.170
So, as you drill through the wall,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.100
those forces balance.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.641
But then there's that moment

00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:28.777
when the drill first punctures
through the other side of the wall,

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:31.633
and right at that moment 
the wall can't push back anymore.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:35.100
But your brain hasn't reacted 
to that change in force.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.161
So for that millisecond,

00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.793
or however long it takes you 
to react, you're still pushing,

00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:41.337
and that unbalanced force 
causes an acceleration,

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:44.449
and that is the plunge.

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.353
But what if right at the moment of puncture

00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:49.977
you could pull that tip back,

00:05:49.977 --> 00:05:52.990
actually oppose the forward acceleration?

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.127
That's what I set out to do.

00:05:55.127 --> 00:05:56.447
So imagine you have a device

00:05:56.447 --> 00:05:59.647
and it's got some kind of sharp tip 
to cut through tissue.

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:02.860
What's the simplest way 
you could pull that tip back?

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.671
I chose a spring.

00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:07.255
So when you extend that spring, 
you extend that tip out

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:09.470
so it's ready to puncture tissue,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.910
the spring wants to pull the tip back.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.663
How do you keep the tip in place

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:15.127
until the moment of puncture?

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:17.550
I used this mechanism.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.111
When the tip of the device
is pressed against tissue,

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.951
the mechanism expands outwards 
and wedges in place against the wall.

00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:25.655
And the friction that's generated

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:28.847
locks it in place and prevents
the spring from retracting the tip.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.734
But right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:32.798
the tissue can't push back
on the tip anymore.

00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:35.980
So the mechanism unlocks 
and the spring retracts the tip.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.630
Let me show you that 
happening in slow motion.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.278
This is about 2,000 frames a second,

00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:41.150
and I'd like you to notice the tip

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.778
that's right there on the bottom, 
about to puncture through tissue.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.839
And you'll see that 
right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.892
right there, the mechanism unlocks 
and retracts that tip back.

00:06:51.892 --> 00:06:54.236
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.

00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:56.428
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,

00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:58.420
and right when it punctures 
that rubber membrane

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.572
it's going to disappear
into this white blunt sheath.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.437
Right there.

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:09.101
That happens within four 100ths 
of a second after puncture.

00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:12.901
And because this device is designed
to address the physics of puncture

00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:14.733
and not the specifics of cranial drilling

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:16.940
or laparoscopic surgery, 
or another procedure,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.597
it's applicable across these
different medical disciplines

00:07:19.597 --> 00:07:22.628
and across different length scales.

00:07:22.628 --> 00:07:24.741
But it didn't always look like this.

00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:26.926
This was my first prototype.

00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:29.568
Yes, those are popsicle sticks,

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:31.470
and there's a rubber band at the top.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.870
It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.566
And it proved to me that my idea worked

00:07:36.566 --> 00:07:39.958
and it justified the next couple
years of work on this project.

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.766
I worked on this because

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:43.429
this problem really fascinated me.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.558
It kept me up at night.

00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:48.540
But I think it should fascinate you too,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.442
because I said puncture is everywhere.

00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:54.706
That means at some point 
it's going to be your problem too.

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.266
That first day in the operating room

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:59.250
I never expected to find myself 
on the other end of a trocar.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.140
But last year, I got appendicitis 
when I was visiting Greece.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.970
So I was in the hospital in Athens,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.458
and the surgeon was telling me

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:08.594
he was going to perform 
a laparoscopic surgery.

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:11.346
He was going to remove my appendix 
through these tiny incisions,

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:14.040
and he was talking about what
I could expect for the recovery,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.482
and what was going to happen.

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:17.900
He said, "Do you have any questions?"
And I said, "Just one, doc.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.374
What kind of trocar do you use?"

00:08:21.374 --> 00:08:24.879
So my favorite quote 
about laparoscopic surgery

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.525
comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:

00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:31.189
"It is puncture itself that causes risk."

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:34.325
That's my favorite quote 
because H.C. Jacobaeus

00:08:34.325 --> 00:08:38.365
was the first person to ever perform 
laparoscopic surgery on humans,

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:41.797
and he wrote that in 1912.

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:47.581
This is a problem that's been injuring and
even killing people for over 100 years.

00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:49.815
So it's easy to think that for
every major problem out there

00:08:49.815 --> 00:08:53.751
there's some team of experts 
working around the clock to solve it.

00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:57.100
The truth is that's not always the case.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.545
We have to be better at finding those problems

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:02.313
and finding ways to solve them.

00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:05.569
So if you come across a problem that grabs you,

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:07.450
let it keep you up at night.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.593
Allow yourself to be fascinated,

00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:12.505
because there are so many lives to save.

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:15.904
