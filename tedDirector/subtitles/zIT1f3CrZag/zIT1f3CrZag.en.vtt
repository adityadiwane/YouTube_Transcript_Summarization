00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.136
[SHIT]

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.136
This is arguably the back end
of the design of animals.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.136
(Laughter)

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.580
But the reason
I put this up here is because

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.715
when I was in Africa last year,
my wife and I were driving around,

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.961
we had this wonderful guide,

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:38.136
who showed us something
that surprised both of us,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.136
and it was very revealing
in terms of the fascination

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.136
that comes with the design of animals.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.136
It turns out that in about the 1880s,
the missionaries came to Africa

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.136
to spread the word of Christianity,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.137
to teach English to the natives.

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:54.054
And they brought blackboards and chalk.

00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:56.631
And I'd like you to imagine
that that's a blackboard,

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.477
and I just used some chalk on there.

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.902
And they brought
quite a bit of this stuff.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.563
But over the years,
the blackboards were fine,

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.564
but they ran out of chalk.

00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:07.588
And this is a real crisis for them.

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.461
And that's where the hyena comes in.

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:13.236
The hyena is probably
the most perfectly designed

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.137
scavenging animal in the world.

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.136
It strip-mines carcasses,
and it has amazing teeth,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.953
because it enables the hyena
to essentially eat bones.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Now, the end product of that action
is up on the board here.

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.825
What the missionaries would do is,
they'd walk around

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:36.913
and they'd pick up hyena shit.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.636
And the incredible thing
about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.215
(Laughter)

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.136
That's not what I'm here to talk about,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.771
but it is a fascinating aspect
of animal design.

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:51.136
What I'm here to talk about is the camel.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.136
When I started talking to Richard

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.136
about what I was going to speak about,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.784
I had recently come back from Jordan,

00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:01.030
where I had an amazing
experience with a camel.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.136
(Laughter)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.581
And we were in the desert.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.422
Richard Wurman: That's the end!
Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:11.691
We were in the desert,
in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.715
There were four of us,
two Bedouin drivers.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.047
You can just imagine,
this expanse is an ocean of sand,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
105 degrees, one water bottle.

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:26.120
And we were driving in what they told us
was their very, very best Jeep.

00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:28.762
Didn't look like it to me.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:31.688
And as we started to go
through the desert,

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:34.136
the Jeep broke down.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.136
The guys got out, they put the hood up,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.835
they started working
under the hood, got it going again.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.629
About a hundred yards, it broke down.

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:43.930
This went on about 6-7 times,
we were getting more and more alarmed,

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:46.612
we were also getting deeper
and deeper into the desert.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:49.136
And eventually,
our worst nightmare happened:

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.136
they flooded the engine.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.884
And they said, "Ah, no problem!
We just get out and walk."

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.137
And we said, "We get out and walk?"

00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:59.413
One water bottle, remember,
guys, four people.

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:02.794
And they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk.
We'll find some camels."

00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:05.057
We got out and walked, and sure enough,

00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.691
about half a mile, we came
over the crest of this hill,

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:10.613
and there was a huge gathering
of Bedouin with their camels.

00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:12.532
The guy went up and started dickering,

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:15.136
and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.678
They went down like elevators;
we got on them.

00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:21.136
They went back up, and the Bedouin,
each Bedouin, four of them,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.136
got behind each of the camels
with a little whip.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.136
And they started slashing away
at the back of the camels,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.452
and they started galloping.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:31.953
And if you've ever been on a camel,
it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.136
There's also one other aspect
about these camels.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.136
About every 10 steps, they lean back

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.136
and try to take a chunk out of your leg.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.239
(Laughter)

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:42.136
So we kept on going,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.136
and this camel kept on trying
to take a chunk out of my leg.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.294
And eventually, three miles later,
we arrived at our destination,

00:03:48.318 --> 00:03:50.136
where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.477
And the camels come down
again like elevators,

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:54.136
we sort of clumsily get off,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.136
and they, obviously, try to take
another chunk out of my leg.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.136
And I've developed
a very wonderful relationship

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.136
with this creature by this point,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
and I've realized
that this is a mean son of a bitch.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.136
And much meaner, by the way,
than the Bedouin who greeted me

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.700
and tried to sell me
one of his 26 daughters

00:04:11.724 --> 00:04:13.700
to take back to the States.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.034
So as we talked, Richard and I,

00:04:16.058 --> 00:04:18.319
I said, "You know, maybe
I should bring a camel.

00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:20.576
It's the best designed
animal in the world."

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.484
He went, "Nah. I don't think
we want to be bringing a camel."

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:26.645
And you should be really glad
we decided not to bring the camel.

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.160
So I did the next best thing.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.121
I went to the Washington Zoo.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.498
Richard said, "I want you to get up
close and personal with this camel.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.673
I want you to inspect its mouth,
look at its teeth.

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:41.136
Go underneath it.
Go above it. Go around it.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.693
Pull its tail up; take a look in there.

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:47.136
I want you to get as close
to that camel as you possibly can."

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.406
So, I got a National Geographic film crew.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:55.332
We went down there,
and I took one look at this camel.

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:01.136
It is a 2,000 pound creature
who is in rut.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.954
(Laughter)

00:05:03.978 --> 00:05:06.835
Now, if you've ever seen
a 2,000 pound camel in rut,

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:09.096
it is a scary, scary thing to behold.

00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:13.683
And if Richard thought I was getting
in the ring with that camel,

00:05:13.707 --> 00:05:16.136
someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.342
(Laughter)

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:21.136
So we got as close to it as possible,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.502
and I'm going to share this.

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:24.295
Chris, if you want to roll this film.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.573
Then I'm going to show you

00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:27.693
a little bit more
about the design of camels.

00:05:27.717 --> 00:05:29.098
Do you want to roll the film?

00:05:29.447 --> 00:05:31.502
(Adventure music)

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.101
(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:09.619
with the TED National Geographic
Camel Investigation Unit.

00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:12.643
I'm here to look
at the ultimate desert machine.

00:06:13.076 --> 00:06:15.457
(Music continues)

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:22.565
Keith Bellows: And you'll note
I started chewing gum

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.565
because I was around this camel all day.

00:06:25.124 --> 00:06:26.703
(Video) That's it, OK. No!

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.817
See, now he's getting
a little overexcited.

00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:33.416
So we'll need to be very careful
around him. Don't let him get you.

00:06:55.334 --> 00:06:59.516
Now, you can see copious amounts
of saliva in there.

00:07:02.436 --> 00:07:05.560
I always called myself
the unstable stable boy.

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:09.235
Their nose, you can see
his nose is flared right now.

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:12.907
When they're in rut,
they're similar to seals

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:15.931
in the way, like, a seal has
to open its nose to breathe.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.123
And they're similar.
They have to consciously open their nose.

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:22.148
KB: Ears?

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:25.741
SK: They are small.
But they have excellent hearing.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.231
But not big; for instance,
in zebras, they have a huge ear

00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:36.136
that's very mobile, so they can
actually turn them both around.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.136
And they use them in the same way
we use our binocular vision.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.136
They use that to pinpoint sound.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.317
The desert's extremely windy
as well as being very cold.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.812
So not only do they have
the very long eyelashes,

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.695
but there's the secondary --

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:56.136
I guess you'd call it
the [unclear] or whatever.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.136
It's this hair that's above the eyes,
and below it, it's longer.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.136
Most people think
that the humps store water.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.833
They don't. They store fat.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.136
Now, I'm not a chemist,
but basically what happens

00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:19.449
is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.

00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:24.533
And that will turn it
into actually usable water.

00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:27.136
Like a lot of predators,
they walk on their toes.

00:08:28.496 --> 00:08:32.136
But there's a big fat pad
in there that squishes out.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.136
They're like sun shoes,
but, you know, with sand.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.136
Hooves? They don't have
traditional hooves,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.120
but they do have one, like, big nail.

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:45.438
(Audience laughter)

00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:48.439
You can't really see too clear.
The fur's kind of grown over.

00:08:48.463 --> 00:08:51.439
But they use their tails a lot,
especially in rut.

00:08:52.358 --> 00:08:58.136
He will urinate and spin his tail
to spread the urine around

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.136
and make him more attractive.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.256
I don't know why that would be,
but it works for them.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.775
So, what the hell.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.136
(Audience laughter)

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.929
Now, they will also defecate
in certain areas.

00:09:11.953 --> 00:09:14.528
Generally, they poop
wherever they want to,

00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:21.066
but during their rut,
they will defecate in perimeter areas.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.136
I don't know if you've read or heard
about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.136
you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.136
These big, big rumbling sounds.
He will do the same thing.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.047
You can actually see,
right here, it will vibrate.

00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:37.969
We weigh our animals.

00:09:37.993 --> 00:09:42.136
Unfortunately,
he's a very aggressive animal,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.136
so he's actually destroyed
some of the scales.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.208
We had these big things that I weigh
the bison on, for instance.

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:51.956
I'm guessing that
he's at least 1,600 pounds.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.136
But I would put him closer to 2,000.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.551
He's basically a walking mulch pile.

00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:59.677
We're kind of like buds,
but I'm also a male as well.

00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:02.604
KB: He sees you as competition?
Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:05.136
And it makes him very dangerous
at this time of year.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.136
Don't even think about it.
Don't think about it!

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.802
But now, we're going to meet. Out!

00:10:14.874 --> 00:10:17.160
Out! Out!

00:10:19.087 --> 00:10:20.088
No.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.203
Out!

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:26.602
(Music)

00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:48.136
(Applause)

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.160
KB: What I didn't show you was,
you got that swinging thing going?

00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:55.938
Well, and you're glad
I didn't show you this.

00:10:56.582 --> 00:10:59.336
One of the other things
about the camel's beautiful design

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.336
is that its penis points backwards.

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:05.598
That way the camel can dip
its tail in the stream,

00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.136
and just whacker
the entire area around him.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.256
And that's how
he really marks his territory.

00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:14.136
Now, what you also didn't see was that --

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.136
and you may have noticed
in the pen beside him

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.

00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.732
In the pen beside him is Jasmine.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.406
Jasmine has been his mate for some time.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.536
But on this particular occasion,
it was very, very clear

00:11:27.894 --> 00:11:32.346
that as horny as Suki was,
Jasmine was having none of it.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.136
And so we started thinking.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.059
Well, if poor old Suki
is in search of a mate,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.938
what would Suki do to find
the perfect mate?

00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:43.635
I'm going to show you another film.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:45.707
But before I do, I just want to mention

00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:50.136
that this animal truly is a sort
of the SUV of the sand,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.586
the ship of the desert.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.136
It's so vital to the inhabitants
of the areas

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.882
in which the camel is found,
largely Mongolia and Sahara,

00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:06.086
that there are 160 words
in Arabic to describe the camel.

00:12:06.453 --> 00:12:09.136
And if this is a creature
that was designed by committee,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.136
it's certainly been
like no committee I've ever been on.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.525
So here's what Suki would do
in search of a mate.

00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:20.184
Can you roll it, please?

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:21.688
Camel seeking camel

00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:24.653
Lusty beast desires
attractive and sincere mate.

00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:28.034
I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs.,
with brown hair and eyes, long legs --

00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:29.427
and I'm very well ... hung.

00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:36.136
I'm TED Camel.

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:38.319
The perfect desert machine.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.438
I'm smartly designed.

00:12:42.954 --> 00:12:44.595
Eyelashes that keep out sand

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:47.414
and a third eyelash that works
like a windshield wiper.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
A distinguished nose --

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.399
with nostrils lined
to filter out sand and dust

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:59.083
and a groove that catches moisture.

00:12:59.922 --> 00:13:01.708
Amazingly full lips --

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.684
that allow me to eat practically
anything that grows.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
Callouses on my knees
that let me kneel comfortably.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.136
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
Short fur that keeps my skin cool.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.301
Long legs that allow heat to escape.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.670
And my hump?

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.136
Ogden Nash once wrote:

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.399
"The camel has a single hump;
the dromedary two,

00:13:34.423 --> 00:13:37.136
or else the other way around.
I'm never sure. Are you?"

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:39.136
Here's a hint:

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.136
Bactarian.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Dromedary.

00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:48.852
My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat,
but doesn't store H2O.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
I'm built to last.

00:13:55.652 --> 00:13:57.700
I'm the go-to animal
when the oasis is dry.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.541
I usually won't sweat
until my body reaches 105 ºF,

00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:03.275
enough to fry an egg.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.136
I'm able to lose 40%
of my weight without dying.

00:14:09.409 --> 00:14:12.160
(Most animals would
if they lost half that much.)

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.750
I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons
of water a day.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.136
But go without for more than a month.

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:23.566
I'm powerful.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.590
Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Outrun a horse --

00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:33.945
And cover 26 miles on a good day.

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:38.136
Camelot.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.208
Jackie O. once said
that traveling by camel

00:14:40.232 --> 00:14:43.232
made riding an elephant seem
like taking a jet plane.

00:14:47.112 --> 00:14:49.532
Yet my large, soft feet
allow me to navigate sand.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
(Is that why the Bedouin
claim I can dance?)

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.136
I'm a good provider, too.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.136
Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.040
No surprise.

00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:05.136
Tents and rugs are made of my hair.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.303
My dried bones are prized
as a sort of ivory.

00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:09.899
My dung is burned as fuel.
My milk is used for cheese.

00:15:09.923 --> 00:15:12.756
"Camels are like angels,"
a Bedouin once said.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.739
(Applause)

00:15:16.763 --> 00:15:20.136
Thank you. I just want to leave you
with one last thought,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.997
which is probably the most important
thing to take away.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:30.644
Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky
creatures because, by and large,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.136
we really don't have
to adapt to our environment;

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.136
we adapt our environment to us.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.136
And we've seen that repeatedly
through this conference,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.136
not just this year, but in past years.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.435
But this creature that you've just seen

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.994
ultimately adapts,
and keeps adapting and adapting.

00:15:48.018 --> 00:15:50.136
I think when you look
at the animal kingdom,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
that is one of the most remarkable things.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:55.070
It doesn't have an environment
that adapts to it;

00:15:55.094 --> 00:15:56.890
it has to adapt to the environment.

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.889
Ricky, thank you very much for having me.

00:15:58.913 --> 00:16:00.390
RW: That's terrific. Thank you.
