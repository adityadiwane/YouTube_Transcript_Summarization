00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.855
I want to talk about social innovation

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.806
and social entrepreneurship.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.426
I happen to have triplets.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.999
They're little. They're five years old.

00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:31.666
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets.
They say, "Really? How many?"

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.055
(Laughter)

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.180
Here's a picture of the kids --
that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.758
Now, I also happen to be gay.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.818
Being gay and fathering triplets is by far

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:48.684
the most socially innovative,
socially entrepreneurial thing

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.256
I have ever done.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.335
(Laughter)

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.007
(Applause)

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.412
The real social innovation I want
to talk about involves charity.

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:02.806
I want to talk about how the things
we've been taught to think

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.064
about giving and about charity

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:06.969
and about the nonprofit sector,

00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:10.938
are actually undermining
the causes we love,

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.742
and our profound yearning
to change the world.

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:17.328
But before I do that,
I want to ask if we even believe

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:20.306
that the nonprofit sector
has any serious role to play

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.522
in changing the world.

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:26.156
A lot of people say now that business
will lift up the developing economies,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.505
and social business
will take care of the rest.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:33.747
And I do believe that business will move
the great mass of humanity forward.

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:38.913
But it always leaves behind
that 10 percent or more

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:41.698
that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.750
And social business needs markets,

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:47.536
and there are some issues
for which you just can't develop

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.370
the kind of money measures
that you need for a market.

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:53.948
I sit on the board of a center
for the developmentally disabled,

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.282
and these people want laughter

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.445
and compassion and they want love.

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:02.199
How do you monetize that?

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.663
And that's where the nonprofit sector
and philanthropy come in.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:11.500
Philanthropy is the market for love.

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.252
It is the market for all those people

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.675
for whom there is no other market coming.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.823
And so if we really want,
like Buckminster Fuller said,

00:02:19.847 --> 00:02:22.212
a world that works for everyone,

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:24.716
with no one and nothing left out,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.878
then the nonprofit sector has to be

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:29.010
a serious part of the conversation.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.758
But it doesn't seem to be working.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.838
Why have our breast cancer
charities not come close

00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:36.584
to finding a cure for breast cancer,

00:02:36.608 --> 00:02:38.560
or our homeless charities not come close

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:40.874
to ending homelessness in any major city?

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.645
Why has poverty remained stuck

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.720
at 12 percent of the U.S.
population for 40 years?

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:50.881
And the answer is,

00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:54.160
these social problems
are massive in scale,

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:56.938
our organizations
are tiny up against them,

00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:59.794
and we have a belief system
that keeps them tiny.

00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:01.877
We have two rulebooks.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.767
We have one for the nonprofit sector,

00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.310
and one for the rest
of the economic world.

00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:09.250
It's an apartheid, and it discriminates

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:12.200
against the nonprofit sector
in five different areas,

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.983
the first being compensation.

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.878
So in the for-profit sector,
the more value you produce,

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.440
the more money you can make.

00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:21.548
But we don't like nonprofits to use money

00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:24.921
to incentivize people
to produce more in social service.

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:28.011
We have a visceral reaction
to the idea that anyone

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.706
would make very much money
helping other people.

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:33.721
Interestingly, we don't have
a visceral reaction

00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:36.150
to the notion that people
would make a lot of money

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.399
not helping other people.

00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:39.524
You know, you want to make
50 million dollars

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:41.770
selling violent video games
to kids, go for it.

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.915
We'll put you on the cover
of Wired magazine.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.963
But you want to make
half a million dollars

00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:47.476
trying to cure kids of malaria,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.620
and you're considered a parasite yourself.

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:55.572
(Applause)

00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:58.017
And we think of this
as our system of ethics,

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.184
but what we don't realize
is that this system

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:03.366
has a powerful side effect, which is:

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.144
It gives a really stark,
mutually exclusive choice

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:10.802
between doing very well
for yourself and your family

00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:13.220
or doing good for the world,

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:16.038
to the brightest minds
coming out of our best universities,

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.172
and sends tens of thousands of people

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.894
who could make a huge difference
in the nonprofit sector,

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:23.514
marching every year
directly into the for-profit sector

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:27.474
because they're not willing to make
that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:31.609
Businessweek did a survey,
looked at the compensation packages

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.958
for MBAs 10 years out of business school.

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:37.400
And the median compensation
for a Stanford MBA,

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:41.645
with bonus, at the age of 38,
was 400,000 dollars.

00:04:42.232 --> 00:04:44.502
Meanwhile, for the same year,
the average salary

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.355
for the CEO of a $5 million-plus
medical charity in the U.S.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.374
was 232,000 dollars,
and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.621
Now, there's no way you're
going to get a lot of people

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:59.700
with $400,000 talent to make
a $316,000 sacrifice every year

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:01.947
to become the CEO of a hunger charity.

00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:06.552
Some people say, "Well, that's just
because those MBA types are greedy."

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:08.747
Not necessarily. They might be smart.

00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:11.278
It's cheaper for that person to donate

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:15.112
100,000 dollars every year
to the hunger charity;

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:17.050
save 50,000 dollars on their taxes --

00:05:17.074 --> 00:05:21.499
so still be roughly 270,000 dollars
a year ahead of the game --

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:24.118
now be called a philanthropist
because they donated

00:05:24.142 --> 00:05:25.976
100,000 dollars to charity;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.258
probably sit on the board
of the hunger charity;

00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.178
indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.948
who decided to become the CEO
of the hunger charity;

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:33.979
(Laughter)

00:05:34.003 --> 00:05:37.354
and have a lifetime
of this kind of power and influence

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:39.638
and popular praise still ahead of them.

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:44.564
The second area of discrimination
is advertising and marketing.

00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:48.069
So we tell the for-profit sector,
"Spend, spend, spend on advertising,

00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:51.415
until the last dollar no longer
produces a penny of value."

00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:55.305
But we don't like to see our donations
spent on advertising in charity.

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:59.304
Our attitude is, "Well, look,
if you can get the advertising donated,

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:02.573
you know, to air at four o'clock
in the morning, I'm okay with that.

00:06:02.597 --> 00:06:04.961
But I don't want my donation
spent on advertising,

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:06.552
I want it go to the needy."

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.434
As if the money invested in advertising

00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:11.088
could not bring in dramatically
greater sums of money

00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:12.264
to serve the needy.

00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:15.204
In the 1990s, my company created

00:06:15.228 --> 00:06:18.603
the long-distance
AIDSRide bicycle journeys,

00:06:18.627 --> 00:06:23.176
and the 60 mile-long
breast cancer three-day walks,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.160
and over the course of nine years,

00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:31.223
we had 182,000 ordinary
heroes participate,

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:35.143
and they raised a total
of 581 million dollars.

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:38.307
(Applause)

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.784
They raised more money
more quickly for these causes

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:42.474
than any events in history,

00:06:42.498 --> 00:06:45.292
all based on the idea
that people are weary

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:48.118
of being asked to do the least
they can possibly do.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:52.708
People are yearning to measure
the full distance of their potential

00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:55.367
on behalf of the causes
that they care about deeply.

00:06:56.073 --> 00:06:57.708
But they have to be asked.

00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:00.930
We got that many people to participate

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:03.165
by buying full-page ads
in The New York Times,

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.602
in The Boston Globe, in prime time
radio and TV advertising.

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.785
Do you know how many people
we would've gotten

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:10.689
if we put up fliers in the laundromat?

00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:16.480
Charitable giving has remained stuck
in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:19.263
ever since we started
measuring it in the 1970s.

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:21.600
That's an important fact,
because it tells us

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:24.314
that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:27.419
has not been able
to wrestle any market share

00:07:27.443 --> 00:07:29.478
away from the for-profit sector.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.394
And if you think about it,
how could one sector

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:35.475
possibly take market share
away from another sector

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:37.670
if it isn't really allowed to market?

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:40.415
And if we tell the consumer brands,

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:42.995
"You may advertise
all the benefits of your product,"

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.400
but we tell charities, "You cannot
advertise all the good that you do,"

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.185
where do we think the consumer
dollars are going to flow?

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:53.249
The third area of discrimination
is the taking of risk

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:56.480
in pursuit of new ideas
for generating revenue.

00:07:57.388 --> 00:08:01.035
So Disney can make a new
$200 million movie that flops,

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:03.147
and nobody calls the attorney general.

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:07.895
But you do a little $1 million
community fundraiser for the poor,

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:11.812
and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit
to the cause in the first 12 months,

00:08:11.836 --> 00:08:13.974
and your character
is called into question.

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:18.092
So nonprofits are really reluctant
to attempt any brave,

00:08:18.116 --> 00:08:21.043
daring, giant-scale
new fundraising endeavors,

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.668
for fear that if the thing fails,

00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:25.064
their reputations will be dragged
through the mud.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.247
Well, you and I know

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.668
when you prohibit failure,
you kill innovation.

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:32.333
If you kill innovation in fundraising,
you can't raise more revenue;

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.638
if you can't raise more revenue,
you can't grow;

00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:38.074
and if you can't grow, you can't
possibly solve large social problems.

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:40.741
The fourth area is time.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.159
So Amazon went for six years
without returning any profit to investors,

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:46.661
and people had patience.

00:08:47.042 --> 00:08:49.923
They knew that there was a long-term
objective down the line,

00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:51.533
of building market dominance.

00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:54.140
But if a nonprofit organization
ever had a dream

00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:58.414
of building magnificent scale
that required that for six years,

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.302
no money was going to go to the needy,

00:09:00.326 --> 00:09:02.962
it was all going to be invested
in building this scale,

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:04.486
we would expect a crucifixion.

00:09:05.803 --> 00:09:07.430
The last area is profit itself.

00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:09.970
So the for-profit sector
can pay people profits

00:09:09.994 --> 00:09:12.567
in order to attract their capital
for their new ideas,

00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:15.707
but you can't pay profits
in a nonprofit sector,

00:09:15.731 --> 00:09:17.703
so the for-profit sector has a lock

00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:20.208
on the multi-trillion-dollar
capital markets,

00:09:20.232 --> 00:09:24.890
and the nonprofit sector is starved
for growth and risk and idea capital.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.040
Well, you put those
five things together --

00:09:28.064 --> 00:09:31.218
you can't use money to lure talent
away from the for-profit sector;

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:33.433
you can't advertise
on anywhere near the scale

00:09:33.457 --> 00:09:35.811
the for-profit sector
does for new customers;

00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:38.799
you can't take the kinds of risks
in pursuit of those customers

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:40.511
that the for-profit sector takes;

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:44.168
you don't have the same amount of time
to find them as the for-profit sector;

00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:47.256
and you don't have a stock market
with which to fund any of this,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.392
even if you could do it
in the first place --

00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:51.336
and you've just put the nonprofit sector

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.020
at an extreme disadvantage
to the for-profit sector,

00:09:54.044 --> 00:09:55.210
on every level.

00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:00.487
If we have any doubts about the effects
of this separate rule book,

00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.035
this statistic is sobering:

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.399
From 1970 to 2009,

00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:07.154
the number of nonprofits that really grew,

00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:10.358
that crossed the $50 million
annual revenue barrier,

00:10:10.382 --> 00:10:12.016
is 144.

00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:15.344
In the same time, the number
of for-profits that crossed it

00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:17.507
is 46,136.

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:21.499
So we're dealing with social problems
that are massive in scale,

00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:23.849
and our organizations
can't generate any scale.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.674
All of the scale goes
to Coca-Cola and Burger King.

00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:30.126
So why do we think this way?

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:35.252
Well, like most fanatical
dogma in America,

00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:38.161
these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:41.812
The Puritans came here
for religious reasons, or so they said,

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:45.034
but they also came here because
they wanted to make a lot of money.

00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:46.772
They were pious people,

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:49.811
but they were also
really aggressive capitalists,

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:53.355
and they were accused of extreme forms
of profit-making tendencies,

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.292
compared to the other colonists.

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:58.780
But at the same time,
the Puritans were Calvinists,

00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:01.327
so they were taught literally
to hate themselves.

00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:04.395
They were taught
that self-interest was a raging sea

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:07.006
that was a sure path to eternal damnation.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.958
This created a real problem
for these people.

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:13.499
Here they've come all the way across
the Atlantic to make all this money,

00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:16.698
but making all this money
will get you sent directly to Hell.

00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:18.280
What were they to do about this?

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:20.232
Well, charity became their answer.

00:11:20.256 --> 00:11:22.687
It became this economic sanctuary,

00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:26.330
where they could do penance
for their profit-making tendencies --

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:28.354
at five cents on the dollar.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:31.673
So of course, how could you
make money in charity

00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:34.021
if charity was your penance
for making money?

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:38.299
Financial incentive was exiled
from the realm of helping others,

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:41.728
so that it could thrive in the area
of making money for yourself,

00:11:41.752 --> 00:11:44.919
and in 400 years, nothing has intervened

00:11:44.943 --> 00:11:48.177
to say, "That's counterproductive
and that's unfair."

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:54.040
Now, this ideology gets policed
by this one very dangerous question,

00:11:54.064 --> 00:11:58.344
which is, "What percentage of my donation
goes to the cause versus overhead?"

00:11:58.653 --> 00:12:00.860
There are a lot of problems
with this question.

00:12:00.884 --> 00:12:02.384
I'm going to just focus on two.

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:06.473
First, it makes us think
that overhead is a negative,

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:09.290
that it is somehow not part of the cause.

00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:14.117
But it absolutely is, especially
if it's being used for growth.

00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:19.172
Now, this idea that overhead
is somehow an enemy of the cause

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:21.697
creates this second, much larger problem,

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:25.557
which is, it forces organizations
to go without the overhead things

00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:27.189
they really need to grow,

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.485
in the interest of keeping overhead low.

00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:32.692
So we've all been taught
that charities should spend

00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:35.491
as little as possible on overhead
things like fundraising

00:12:35.515 --> 00:12:38.889
under the theory that, well, the less
money you spend on fundraising,

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:41.714
the more money there is
available for the cause.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.938
Well, that's true
if it's a depressing world

00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:47.665
in which this pie cannot
be made any bigger.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.745
But if it's a logical world
in which investment in fundraising

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:55.255
actually raises more funds
and makes the pie bigger,

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.136
then we have it precisely backwards,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.708
and we should be investing more money,
not less, in fundraising,

00:13:00.732 --> 00:13:02.461
because fundraising is the one thing

00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:05.096
that has the potential
to multiply the amount of money

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.937
available for the cause
that we care about so deeply.

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:11.040
I'll give you two examples.

00:13:11.064 --> 00:13:12.310
We launched the AIDSRides

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:15.406
with an initial investment
of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:20.845
Within nine years,
we had multiplied that 1,982 times,

00:13:20.869 --> 00:13:25.059
into 108 million dollars
after all expenses, for AIDS services.

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:28.391
We launched the breast cancer three-days

00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:31.878
with an initial investment
of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.

00:13:32.243 --> 00:13:36.973
Within just five years,
we had multiplied that 554 times,

00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:40.576
into 194 million dollars
after all expenses,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.921
for breast cancer research.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.544
Now, if you were a philanthropist
really interested in breast cancer,

00:13:45.568 --> 00:13:46.861
what would make more sense:

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:50.736
go out and find the most innovative
researcher in the world

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.140
and give her 350,000 dollars for research,

00:13:54.164 --> 00:13:57.783
or give her fundraising
department the 350,000 dollars

00:13:57.807 --> 00:14:02.092
to multiply it into 194 million dollars
for breast cancer research?

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.085
2002 was our most successful year ever.

00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:09.243
We netted for breast cancer
alone, that year alone,

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:12.354
71 million dollars after all expenses.

00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:15.433
And then we went out of business,

00:14:15.457 --> 00:14:17.275
suddenly and traumatically.

00:14:18.569 --> 00:14:23.283
Why? Well, the short story is,
our sponsors split on us.

00:14:23.307 --> 00:14:25.370
They wanted to distance themselves from us

00:14:25.394 --> 00:14:28.251
because we were being
crucified in the media

00:14:28.275 --> 00:14:31.653
for investing 40 percent
of the gross in recruitment

00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:35.041
and customer service
and the magic of the experience,

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:37.928
and there is no accounting
terminology to describe

00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:41.102
that kind of investment
in growth and in the future,

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:44.070
other than this demonic
label of "overhead."

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:51.412
So on one day, all 350
of our great employees

00:14:51.436 --> 00:14:53.062
lost their jobs ...

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.745
because they were labeled "overhead."

00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:01.618
Our sponsor went and tried
the events on their own.

00:15:01.642 --> 00:15:02.975
The overhead went up.

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:06.768
Net income for breast cancer research
went down by 84 percent,

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.710
or 60 million dollars, in one year.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:16.641
This is what happens when we confuse
morality with frugality.

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:21.785
We've all been taught that the bake sale
with five percent overhead

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:24.760
is morally superior to the professional
fundraising enterprise

00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:26.450
with 40 percent overhead,

00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:29.751
but we're missing the most important
piece of information, which is:

00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:32.251
What is the actual size of these pies?

00:15:32.934 --> 00:15:36.853
Who cares if the bake sale only has
five percent overhead if it's tiny?

00:15:37.573 --> 00:15:40.405
What if the bake sale
only netted 71 dollars for charity

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:42.453
because it made no investment in its scale

00:15:42.477 --> 00:15:44.858
and the professional
fundraising enterprise netted

00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:47.188
71 million dollars because it did?

00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:49.426
Now which pie would we prefer,

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.545
and which pie do we think people
who are hungry would prefer?

00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:56.523
Here's how all of this
impacts the big picture.

00:15:57.251 --> 00:16:00.728
I said that charitable giving is
two percent of GDP in the United States.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:03.442
That's about 300 billion dollars a year.

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:06.829
But only about 20 percent of that,
or 60 billion dollars,

00:16:06.853 --> 00:16:08.806
goes to health and human services causes.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.456
The rest goes to religion
and higher education and hospitals,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.378
and that 60 billion dollars
is not nearly enough

00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:16.957
to tackle these problems.

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:21.959
But if we could move charitable giving
from two percent of GDP,

00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:28.621
up just one step to three percent of GDP,
by investing in that growth,

00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:32.680
that would be an extra 150 billion dollars
a year in contributions,

00:16:32.704 --> 00:16:35.062
and if that money
could go disproportionately

00:16:35.086 --> 00:16:36.945
to health and human services charities,

00:16:36.969 --> 00:16:40.208
because those were the ones we encouraged
to invest in their growth,

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:43.990
that would represent a tripling
of contributions to that sector.

00:16:44.573 --> 00:16:46.181
Now we're talking scale.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.689
Now we're talking the potential
for real change.

00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:52.926
But it's never going to happen
by forcing these organizations

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.778
to lower their horizons

00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:58.421
to the demoralizing objective
of keeping their overhead low.

00:17:00.397 --> 00:17:03.729
Our generation does not want
its epitaph to read,

00:17:03.753 --> 00:17:05.880
"We kept charity overhead low."

00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:10.428
(Laughter)

00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:14.284
(Applause)

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:16.515
We want it to read
that we changed the world,

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:18.254
and that part of the way we did that

00:17:18.278 --> 00:17:20.867
was by changing the way
we think about these things.

00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:23.693
So the next time
you're looking at a charity,

00:17:23.717 --> 00:17:25.798
don't ask about the rate
of their overhead.

00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:28.137
Ask about the scale of their dreams,

00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:31.717
their Apple-, Google-,
Amazon-scale dreams,

00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:34.210
how they measure their progress
toward those dreams,

00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.869
and what resources they need
to make them come true,

00:17:36.893 --> 00:17:38.656
regardless of what the overhead is.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.284
Who cares what the overhead is

00:17:40.308 --> 00:17:42.643
if these problems
are actually getting solved?

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:46.603
If we can have that kind of generosity --

00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:48.755
a generosity of thought --

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:51.655
then the non-profit sector
can play a massive role

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:55.111
in changing the world
for all those citizens

00:17:55.135 --> 00:17:57.728
most desperately in need of it to change.

00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:04.206
And if that can be
our generation's enduring legacy --

00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:08.794
that we took responsibility

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.313
for the thinking that had
been handed down to us,

00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:14.153
that we revisited it, we revised it,

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:18.259
and we reinvented the whole way
humanity thinks about changing things,

00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:21.759
forever, for everyone --

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:25.577
well, I thought I would let
the kids sum up what that would be.

00:18:26.561 --> 00:18:28.412
Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be

00:18:28.436 --> 00:18:30.418
Sage Smith-Pallotta: a real social

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.268
Rider Smith-Pallotta: innovation.

00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:34.339
Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.618
Thank you.

00:18:35.642 --> 00:18:42.589
(Applause)

00:18:44.778 --> 00:18:45.951
Thank you.

00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:49.013
(Applause)
