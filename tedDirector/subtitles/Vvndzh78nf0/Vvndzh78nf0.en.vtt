00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
♫ Where do we go from here? ♫

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
♫ How do we carry on? ♫

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
♫ I can't get beyond the questions ♫

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
♫ Clambering for the scraps ♫

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
♫ in the shatter of us, collapsed ♫

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
♫ It cuts me with every could have been ♫

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
♫ Pain on pain on play, repeating ♫

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.160
♫ With the backup, makeshift life in waiting ♫

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
♫ time heals everything ♫

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
♫ What of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
♫ There is nothing to see here now ♫

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
♫ Turning the sign around ♫

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.160
♫ We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice ♫

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
♫ A crumbling cliche case ♫

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
♫ crumpled and puffy faced ♫

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.160
♫ caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles ♫

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
♫ All I want, only one street level miracle ♫

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160
♫ I'll be an out and out born again ♫

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
♫ from none more cynical ♫

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
♫ that time heals everything ♫

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
♫ But what of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
♫ And sit here cold? ♫

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
♫ We will be long gone by then ♫

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
♫ In lackluster ♫

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
♫ for all we could and should be being ♫

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
♫ in the one life that we've got ♫

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
♫ time heals everything ♫

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
♫ And what of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.160
♫ Wait it out ♫

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160
(Applause)
