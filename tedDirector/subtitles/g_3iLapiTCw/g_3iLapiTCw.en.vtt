00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:17.787
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:19.930
where we are looking to find

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.470
alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.278
That's what we're after.

00:00:26.278 --> 00:00:28.458
And we do this because we actually believe

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.732
that silicon technology today is mostly about

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.484
a culture of excess.

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:35.657
It's about the fastest and the most efficient

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:38.087
and the most dazzling gadget you can have,

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:40.985
while about two-thirds of the world

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:44.669
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.252
to even address fundamental needs in life,

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.420
including health care, education

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.499
and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.744
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:01.767
a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.954
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.060
He is an outstanding person,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.202
because he's a small entrepreneur.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.944
He runs a little shop

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.947
in one of the back streets of Mumbai.

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.995
He has this little 10-square-meter store,

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.145
where so much is being done.

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.050
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.533
when I once just happened to bump into him.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.658
Basically, what he does is, he has all these services

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:26.411
for micro-payments and booking tickets

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:29.744
and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,

00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:31.933
but he does it for people offline

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.930
and connects to the digital world.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.435
More importantly, he makes his money

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:38.028
by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:40.303
for the prepaid subscriptions.

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:43.544
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook

00:01:43.544 --> 00:01:46.117
with a few of his employees

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:48.701
where they can fix almost anything.

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:51.959
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.077
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.246
and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.564
"Yes." (Laughter)

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:01.504
I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:06.137
to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)

00:02:06.137 --> 00:02:11.352
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:16.304
and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.895
They have figured out everything that's required

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.921
to dismantle, take things apart,

00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:23.880
rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.847
do whatever you want to with the phone,

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:28.416
and they can fix anything so quickly.

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.416
You can hand over a phone this morning

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.336
and you can go pick it up after lunch,

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:34.256
and it was quite incredible.

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.827
But then we were wondering whether this is

00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:38.369
a local phenomenon, or is truly global?

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.619
And, over time, we started understanding

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.338
and systematically researching

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:44.454
what this tinkering ecosystem is about,

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:46.059
because that is something that's happening

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.091
not just in one street corner in Mumbai.

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.205
It's actually happening in all parts of the country.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.466
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.513
in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.

00:02:55.513 --> 00:02:58.708
Even here in Doha I found this little nook

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.595
where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:04.796
and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.909
You've got to try it on your own to believe it.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.463
But what fuels this?

00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:11.971
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:15.277
and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:19.043
and then redistributed to basically service this industry,

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:21.214
and you can even buy salvaged parts.

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:23.370
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.833
brand new things. You have condemned computers

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.140
that are stripped apart,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.710
and you can buy salvaged components

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.531
and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.

00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.012
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:37.932
That's the real question, because this is something

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:40.157
that's been there, part of every society

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:42.523
that's deprived of enough resources.

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.420
But there's an interesting paradigm.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.912
There's the traditional crafts,

00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:47.915
and then there's the technology crafts.

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.123
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.

00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:52.195
They're not something that's been established.

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.862
It's not something that's institutionalized.

00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:56.633
It's not taught in universities.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.356
It's taught [by] word of mouth,

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:00.265
and it's an informal education system around this.

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:03.067
So we said, "What can we get out of this?

00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:05.801
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.146
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:10.486
which is fantastic because it means that your product

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:12.531
or your service doesn't have to go through

00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:15.139
a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.218
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,

00:04:18.218 --> 00:04:20.250
so it means that you can do a lot more with it.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.564
And then, the most important thing is,

00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:24.940
it gives us large math for low cost.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.269
So it means that you can actually embed

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:30.794
pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds

00:04:30.794 --> 00:04:34.452
of extendable ideas into really simple devices.

00:04:34.452 --> 00:04:39.260
So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.206
It's basically what was the system or the paradigm

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:44.670
before the industrial revolution is now re-happening

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.678
in a whole new way in small digital shops

00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:50.759
across the planet in most developing countries.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.893
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.571
and we said, "What can we do with this?

00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:59.099
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.519
So one of the first things we did is this thing called

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.915
a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:06.666
Basically one of the contexts that we studied was

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:10.153
schools in very remote parts of India.

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:13.412
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:16.114
which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:18.591
who teaches this amazing little social setting.

00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:20.128
It's an informal school,

00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:22.287
but it's really about holistic education.

00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:23.525
The only thing that they don't have

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:25.919
is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.746
sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:32.250
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.062
to do more?" How to access the digital world?

00:05:35.062 --> 00:05:37.624
Instead of being the sole guardian of information,

00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:40.028
be a facilitator to all this information.

00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:43.412
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"

00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:46.067
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:48.599
and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.591
that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"

00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:53.934
So we walked around.

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:56.224
We went and scavenged the nearby markets,

00:05:56.224 --> 00:06:00.245
and we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:02.772
So the thing that we got

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:05.979
was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.316
that comes for about 60 dollars.

00:06:08.316 --> 00:06:10.772
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,

00:06:10.772 --> 00:06:12.562
and a bunch of small speakers.

00:06:12.562 --> 00:06:14.860
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.784
a connected multimedia platform.

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:20.269
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.620
of different formats and play them.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.646
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:28.637
and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,

00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:30.853
and the lunch box is a nice little package

00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:32.900
in which you can put everything inside,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.463
and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of

00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:35.881
amplify the sound large enough.

00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:39.420
Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.013
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,

00:06:42.013 --> 00:06:43.673
and you really have to get above that.

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:46.394
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:48.484
of a mobile phone repair shop,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:49.912
and then the magic happens.

00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:51.293
We dismantle the whole thing,

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.650
we reassemble it in a new configuration,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.828
and we do this hardware mashup,

00:06:55.828 --> 00:06:58.437
systematically training the guy how to do this.

00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:01.892
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:08.718
(Applause)

00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:11.736
And we systematically field tested,

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:14.104
because in the field testing we learned some

00:07:14.104 --> 00:07:16.621
important lessons, and we went through many iterations.

00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:19.316
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.

00:07:19.316 --> 00:07:23.294
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.

00:07:23.294 --> 00:07:25.846
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.974
darkness in the classroom to do these things.

00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:31.816
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:34.394
and the next version we came up with was a box

00:07:34.394 --> 00:07:36.774
that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,

00:07:36.774 --> 00:07:39.573
but most importantly connect to a car battery,

00:07:39.573 --> 00:07:42.567
because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.774
in places where there's not enough electricity

00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:46.734
or erratic electricity.

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:48.703
And the other key thing that we did was

00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:51.165
make this box run off a USB key, because we realized

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:54.519
that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.094
at least, in theory, it was much more efficient

00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.984
to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.

00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:02.824
It might take a few days to get there,

00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:05.198
but at least it gets there in high definition

00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:07.413
and in a reliable quality.

00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:09.695
So we made this box, and we tested it again

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:11.230
and again and again, and we're going through

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.779
multiple iterations to do these things.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.748
But it's not limited to just education.

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:17.614
This kind of a technique or metrology

00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:19.626
can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,

00:08:19.626 --> 00:08:21.534
and I'm going to tell you one more little story.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.989
It's about this little device called a medi-meter.

00:08:23.989 --> 00:08:27.356
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:30.683
In India, there is a context of these amazing people,

00:08:30.683 --> 00:08:32.962
the health care workers called ASHA workers.

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:35.379
They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:37.763
who live in the local community and are trained

00:08:37.763 --> 00:08:40.331
with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,

00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:44.093
and the main purpose is basically to inform people

00:08:44.093 --> 00:08:47.626
to basically, how to lead a better life, but also

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:50.854
to divert or sort of make recommendations

00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:53.528
of what kind of health care should they approach?

00:08:53.528 --> 00:08:56.240
They are basically referral services, essentially.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.548
But the problem with that is that we realized

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:02.738
after a bunch of research that they are amazing

00:09:02.738 --> 00:09:05.218
at referring people to the nearest clinic

00:09:05.218 --> 00:09:08.091
or the public health care system, but what happens at the

00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:12.169
public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines

00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:14.979
and too many people who overload the system

00:09:14.979 --> 00:09:17.545
simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:19.747
for the population that's being referred.

00:09:19.747 --> 00:09:21.866
So everything from a common cold

00:09:21.866 --> 00:09:24.526
to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:27.570
level of attention, and there's no priorities.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.641
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way

00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:31.442
of doing this for sure."

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:34.019
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.950
that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.465
but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral

00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:43.946
system that allows load balancing of the network,

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:47.885
and directs patients to different sources of health care

00:09:47.885 --> 00:09:51.765
based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.746
So the real key question was,

00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:55.414
how do we empower this woman?

00:09:55.414 --> 00:09:57.341
How do we empower her with simple tools

00:09:57.341 --> 00:10:00.292
that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:04.072
so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:06.100
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.018
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:12.938
distances that people need to travel, often sometimes

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:15.611
seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,

00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:21.074
to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental

00:10:21.074 --> 00:10:23.528
in the sense that it really dissuades people

00:10:23.528 --> 00:10:25.537
from getting access to health care.

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.572
So if there was something that she could do,

00:10:27.572 --> 00:10:28.681
that would be amazing.

00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:31.742
So what we did was that we converted this device

00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:33.559
into a medical device.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.835
I want to demo this actually,

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:37.508
because it's a very simple process.

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:39.917
Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:46.119
Come along. (Applause)

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:49.044
So, what we're going to do is that

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:52.016
we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,

00:10:52.016 --> 00:10:54.871
including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen

00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:56.744
that's there in your blood.

00:10:56.744 --> 00:11:00.035
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.809
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.475
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:07.483
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:11.833
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:13.845
So ... (Laughter)

00:11:13.845 --> 00:11:18.236
So I take it into the start position, and then

00:11:18.236 --> 00:11:21.848
I press the read button. (Beeps)

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:27.329
So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:30.107
And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:33.382
Let's see what happens here.

00:11:33.382 --> 00:11:35.465
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:39.301
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)

00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:41.646
VV: So ... (Applause)

00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:44.863
So the thing about this is that

00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:48.968
if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,

00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:50.814
we would have to rush you to a hospital.

00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:54.934
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange

00:11:54.934 --> 00:11:57.763
or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,

00:11:57.763 --> 00:12:00.807
sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.

00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.158
So that was a very simple three-step screening process

00:12:03.158 --> 00:12:05.273
that could basically change the equation

00:12:05.273 --> 00:12:08.013
of how public health care works in so many different ways.

00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:09.910
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.303
(Applause)

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:17.743
So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,

00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:20.033
because that's the more interesting part.

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:22.727
So essentially, the three things that are required

00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:27.255
to make this conversion from this guy to this guy

00:12:27.255 --> 00:12:31.384
is a cheap remote control for a television

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:34.295
that you can almost find in every home today,

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:38.009
some parts from a computer mouse, basically,

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:41.872
something that you can scavenge for very low cost,

00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:44.783
and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.

00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:47.184
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few

00:12:47.184 --> 00:12:49.979
extra components that can be shipped for very little cost

00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:52.972
across the world, and that's what is all required

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.363
with a little bit of local tinkering talent

00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:58.150
to convert the device into something else.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.546
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests

00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:04.596
to basically ascertain whether something like this actually

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:06.163
makes sense to the ASHA worker.

00:13:06.163 --> 00:13:09.707
We are going through some reference tests to compare it

00:13:09.707 --> 00:13:13.165
against professional equipment to see if there's a degree

00:13:13.165 --> 00:13:15.487
of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact

00:13:15.487 --> 00:13:18.095
in people's lives. But most importantly,

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.890
what we are trying to do right now

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.144
is we are trying to scale this up, because there

00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:24.831
are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground

00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:27.568
who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can

00:13:27.568 --> 00:13:31.128
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,

00:13:31.128 --> 00:13:34.086
it just changes the way the economics of public health care

00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:37.097
works, and it changes the way systems actually function,

00:13:37.097 --> 00:13:41.363
not just on a systematic planning level,

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:44.548
but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.

00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:47.349
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.

00:13:47.349 --> 00:13:50.507
Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:59.153
(Applause)
