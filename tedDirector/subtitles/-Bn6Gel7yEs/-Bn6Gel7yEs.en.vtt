00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
First place I'd like to take you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that I'll talk a little bit about.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One of the things that's changed here,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in the last 150 years since Jules Verne

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that you can see for hundreds of meters

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
without a break in the line of sight.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for anywhere from two to four months,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And a lot of people ask me, you know,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what kind of people do you get for a project like this?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
While our selection process

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(Laughter)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But we also value esprit de corps

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
while under great stress in remote locations.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
except that you're now running a string of these things down.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
is artificially illuminated at great effort.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Video)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
are obsolete and dangerous.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
(Laughter)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Along that same line, I have to tell you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
we have never seen monsters underground --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
at least the kind that eat you.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If there is a monster underground,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
it is the crushing psychological remoteness

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that begins to hit every member of the team

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that's a little over 8,600 feet down --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
at 30 kilometers from the entrance.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that collects water and fills to the roof.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And when you used to find these things,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is because the confrontation of these things

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
forced me to become an inventor.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And we've since gone on to develop

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
for long range, away from a safe haven.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that came out in 1999.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
To experience it is a privilege.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to another unexplored world.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is Europa.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is one of the places where planetary scientists

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
believe there is a highest probability of the detection

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
For those who have never seen this story,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
There was a brief clip --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
would be the ultimate robotic challenge.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and to find a good landing site on the ice.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now we have to get through the ice.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You need a melt probe.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
through the ancient ice, until finally --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is the target site,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and beyond that nobody knows anything.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
There are two primary targets we're doing here.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
There are more stages involved here

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
sulphide, halide, things like that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
where there's a high probability of life.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
looking for changes in color.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We either draw in a liquid sample,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
No hands at the wheel.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is all behavioral autonomy here

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that's being conducted by the robot on its own.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
The real hat trick for this vehicle, though,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
allowing it to do new exploration

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
on what it's gone through already.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
What I'm going to show you next

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that's ever been done.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
robotically-discovered division of bacteria.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
What then of manned space exploration?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The successful conclusion of that mission will result

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
of government scientists and pilots.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Something fundamental has to change

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
One of them is the requirement

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
for economical earth-to-space transport.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
have got this in their sights and I salute them.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Go, go, go.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
a gas station on orbit.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's not going to look like that.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now, to give you a chance to understand

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
why there is power in that statement,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Anybody drink one of these here this week?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That's more than you pay for TED,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
if Google dropped their sponsorship.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
(Laughter)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
every time you hit the accelerator.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
There is a place where you can.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
if you can find propellant on the moon.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
There is a little-known mission that was launched

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
on the south pole of the moon.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
That signal was so strong,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
by the impact of asteroids and comet material.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We can't do that right now.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
that has to be launched from the ground,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We have to beat that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And we can extend that now to just about everything.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We can go much further.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
There's another thing.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
When you're coming back from the moon,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
you have to deal with orbital mechanics.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You got two choices.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You can dive into the stratosphere,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It has never been done.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
better than Disney.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The traditional approach to space exploration

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
has been that you carry all the fuel you need

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to get everybody back in case of an emergency.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
If you try to do that for the moon,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
But if you send a mining team there,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
without the return propellant, first --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
so we're not going to burn the gear.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and it would be the most dramatic demonstration

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that you could do something worthwhile off this planet

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that has ever been done.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
That's not true.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
In seven years, we could pull off

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
The orbital refueling stations I've just described

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
for opening space to the general exploration.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
of purpose and timing.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I intend to lead that expedition.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
(Applause)

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It can be done in seven years with the right backing.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and join other bold individuals from time past

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We have collectively forgotten that lesson.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and complete the final piece

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Thank you.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
(Applause)
