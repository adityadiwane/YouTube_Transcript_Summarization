00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:18.520
So a chip, a poet and a boy.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.485
It's just about 20 years ago,

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.989
June 1994, when Intel announced

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.002
that there was a flaw

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.819
at the core of their Pentium chip.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.200
Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.451
to calculate intermediate quotients necessary

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.285
for iterative floating points of divisions --

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.384
I don't know what that means, but 
it's what it says on Wikipedia —

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.263
there was a flaw and an error

00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:43.479
that meant that there was a certain probability

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.487
that the result of the calculation would be an error,

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:49.080
and the probability was one out of every

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.617
360 billion calculations.

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.611
So Intel said your average spreadsheet

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:59.117
would be flawed once every 27,000 years.

00:00:59.117 --> 00:01:00.411
They didn't think it was significant,

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.637
but there was an outrage in the community.

00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:05.987
The community, the techies, said, this flaw

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:07.068
has to be addressed.

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.069
They were not going to stand by quietly

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.017
as Intel gave them these chips.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:13.063
So there was a revolution across the world.

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:16.093
People marched to demand --

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:18.202
okay, not really exactly like that —

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:20.943
but they rose up and they demanded

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:23.935
that Intel fix the flaw.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:29.787
And Intel set aside 475 million dollars

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:32.029
to fund the replacement of millions of chips

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.120
to fix the flaw.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.332
So billions of dollars in our society

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:37.516
was spent to address a problem

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:41.607
which would come once out of every 360 billion

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:43.694
calculations.

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:46.297
Number two, a poet.

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:48.577
This is Martin Niemöller.

00:01:48.577 --> 00:01:50.110
You're familiar with his poetry.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.886
Around the height of the Nazi period,

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.158
he started repeating the verse,

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:55.893
"First they came for the communists,

00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:57.424
and I did nothing,

00:01:57.424 --> 00:01:59.674
did not speak out because I was not a communist.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:00.728
Then they came for the socialists.

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:02.690
Then they came for the trade unions.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.936
Then they came for the Jews.

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.838
And then they came for me.

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:11.509
But there was no one left to speak for me."

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.638
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:17.970
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.684
We could call it cluefulness.

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:23.245
It's a certain kind of test:

00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:25.037
Can you recognize

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:27.541
an underlying threat and respond?

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.031
Can you save yourself or save your kind?

00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.770
Turns out ants are pretty good at this.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.853
Cows, not so much.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:37.283
So can you see the pattern?

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:39.630
Can you see a pattern and then recognize

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.682
and do something about it? Number two.

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:45.609
Number three, a boy.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.910
This is my friend Aaron Swartz.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.341
He's Tim's friend.

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:51.373
He's friends of many of you in this audience,

00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:52.798
and seven years ago,

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:55.784
Aaron came to me with a question.

00:02:55.784 --> 00:02:58.367
It was just before I was going
to give my first TED Talk.

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.790
I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.297
"Laws that choke creativity."

00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:04.906
And Aaron looked at me

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:06.857
and was a little impatient, and he said,

00:03:06.857 --> 00:03:10.950
"So how are you ever

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.990
going to solve the problems you're talking about?

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.792
Copyright policy, Internet policy,

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:17.982
how are you ever going to address those problems

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:21.215
so long as there's this fundamental corruption

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:24.060
in the way our government works?"

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.665
So I was a little put off by this.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.650
He wasn't sharing in my celebration.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.817
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron,

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:32.911
it's not my field, not my field."

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.467
He said, "You mean as an
academic, it's not your field?"

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:38.061
I said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."

00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.392
He said, "What about as a citizen?

00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:44.819
As a citizen."

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.415
Now, this is the way Aaron was.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:51.476
He didn't tell. He asked questions.

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:53.226
But his questions spoke as clearly

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:55.914
as my four-year-old's hug.

00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:57.330
He was saying to me,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.262
"You've got to get a clue.

00:03:59.262 --> 00:04:00.938
You have got to get a clue, because there is

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:04.000
a flaw at the core of the operating system

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.507
of this democracy,

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:09.805
and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times

00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:11.597
our democracy tries to make a decision.

00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:13.418
It is every time,

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:15.814
every single important issue.

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:20.347
We've got to end the bovinity of this political society.

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.990
We've got to adopt, it turns out,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.762
the word is fourmi-formatic attitude --

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:26.532
that's what the Internet tells me the word is --

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.604
the ant's appreciative attitude

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:31.242
that gets us to recognize this flaw,

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:37.055
save our kind and save our demos.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:38.533
Now if you know Aaron Swartz,

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:42.171
you know that we lost him

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:44.503
just over a year ago.

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:46.039
It was about six weeks

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.919
before I gave my TED Talk,

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.814
and I was so grateful to Chris

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:51.245
that he asked me to give this TED Talk,

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.445
not because I had the chance to talk to you,

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.729
although that was great,

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.162
but because it pulled me out
of an extraordinary depression.

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:03.671
I couldn't begin to describe the sadness.

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:04.951
Because I had to focus.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:09.266
I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:11.468
It saved me.

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.417
But after the buzz, the excitement,

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:17.892
the power that comes from this community,

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:20.443
I began to yearn for a less sterile,

00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:22.960
less academic way to address these issues,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.749
the issues that I was talking about.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.605
We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:31.273
as a target for this political movement,

00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:33.810
because the primary in New Hampshire

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.600
is so incredibly important.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.201
It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.519
that was beginning to talk about, how would we make

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:43.769
this issue of this corruption central in 2016?

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:47.210
But it was another soul that caught my imagination,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.547
a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.

00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:55.909
On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.738
at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.

00:06:00.738 --> 00:06:04.008
She started in Los Angeles

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.970
and began to walk to Washington, D.C.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.698
with a single sign on her chest that said,

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:12.282
"campaign finance reform."

00:06:12.282 --> 00:06:15.010
Eighteen months later,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.820
at the age of 90,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.346
she arrived in Washington
with hundreds following her,

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:21.664
including many congressmen
who had gotten in a car

00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:24.572
and driven out about a mile outside of the city

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:26.460
to walk in with her.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.602
(Laughter)

00:06:28.602 --> 00:06:31.892
Now, I don't have 13 months

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.534
to walk across the country.

00:06:33.534 --> 00:06:36.176
I've got three kids who hate to walk,

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:37.578
and a wife who, it turns out,

00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:39.476
still hates when I'm not there

00:06:39.476 --> 00:06:40.645
for mysterious reasons,

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:41.950
so this was not an option,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.110
but the question I asked,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.658
could we remix Granny D a bit?

00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:47.790
What about a walk not of 3,200 miles

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.710
but of 185 miles across New Hampshire

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.314
in January?

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.540
So on January 11,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.426
the anniversary of Aaron's death,

00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:04.169
we began a walk that ended on January 24th,

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.515
the day that Granny D was born.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:13.095
A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,

00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:16.869
as we went from the very top to the
very bottom of New Hampshire

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:19.265
talking about this issue.

00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:20.865
And what was astonishing to me,

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:23.426
something I completely did not expect to find,

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:26.021
was the passion and anger

00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:31.496
that there was among everyone
that we talked to about this issue.

00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:36.602
We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans

00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:38.441
believe it important to reduce the influence

00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:40.687
of money in politics.

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:42.703
Now politicians and pundits tell you,

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.523
there's nothing we can do about this issue,

00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:45.859
Americans don't care about it,

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:48.155
but the reason for that is

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:50.009
that 91 percent of Americans

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.531
think there's nothing that can
be done about this issue.

00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:57.353
And it's this gap between 96 and 91

00:07:57.353 --> 00:07:59.830
that explains our politics of resignation.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.913
I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us

00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:03.775
wish we could fly like Superman,

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.939
but because at least 91 percent
of us believe we can't,

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:09.605
we don't leap off of tall buildings every time

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:10.915
we have that urge.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:12.921
That's because we accept our limits,

00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:15.680
and so too with this reform.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.973
But when you give people the sense of hope,

00:08:19.973 --> 00:08:26.690
you begin to thaw that
absolute sense of impossibility.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.305
As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:33.020
you give 'em a chance, a way to think

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.109
about how this change is possible.

00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:37.960
Hope.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.530
And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.527
failed him with, because we let him

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:50.127
lose that sense of hope.

00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:54.079
I loved that boy like I love my son.

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:02.202
But we failed him.

00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:05.790
And I love my country,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.144
and I'm not going to fail that.

00:09:08.144 --> 00:09:09.316
I'm not going to fail that.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:13.009
That sense of hope, we're going to hold,

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:14.475
and we're going to fight for,

00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:19.175
however impossible this battle looks.

00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:20.469
What's next?

00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:23.630
Well, we started with this march with 200 people,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.032
and next year, there will be 1,000

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:28.671
on different routes

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:31.181
that march in the month of January

00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:35.009
and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.569
and then in 2016, before the primary,

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:40.530
there will be 10,000 who march across that state,

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.594
meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:46.365
And as we have marched, people around the country

00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:48.223
have begun to say, "Can we do the same thing

00:09:48.223 --> 00:09:49.340
in our state?"

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.719
So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:53.710
that is, Granny D walkers,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.837
and Granny D walkers across the country

00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:58.939
will be marching for this reform. Number one.

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:01.219
Number two, on this march,

00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:04.011
one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,

00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:05.630
was with us,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.488
and he said, "Well what can we do?"

00:10:07.488 --> 00:10:09.817
And so they developed a platform,

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.739
which we are announcing today,

00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:14.205
that allows us to pull together voters

00:10:14.205 --> 00:10:16.883
who are committed to this idea of reform.

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.029
Regardless of where you are,

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:20.681
in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,

00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:22.591
you can sign up and directly be informed

00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.579
where the candidates are on this issue

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:27.219
so you can decide who to vote for

00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:30.137
as a function of which is going

00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:34.605
to make this possibility real.

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:38.677
And then finally number three, the hardest.

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:40.500
We're in the age of the Super PAC.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.609
Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:46.859
that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:50.499
It is now an official word in the dictionary.

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:55.894
So on May 1, aka May Day,

00:10:55.894 --> 00:10:58.681
we're going to try an experiment.

00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.498
We're going to try a launching

00:11:00.498 --> 00:11:02.796
of what we can think of as a Super PAC

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:06.060
to end all Super PACs.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.860
And the basic way this works is this.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.632
For the last year, we have been working

00:11:09.632 --> 00:11:13.352
with analysts and political experts

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:16.684
to calculate, how much would it cost

00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:19.106
to win enough votes in the United States Congress

00:11:19.106 --> 00:11:20.926
to make fundamental reform possible?

00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:23.728
What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?

00:11:23.728 --> 00:11:25.568
What is that number?

00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:28.333
And then whatever that number is,

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.438
we are going to kickstart, sort of,

00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:32.369
because you can't use KickStarter for political work,

00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:35.140
but anyway, kickstart, sort of,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.496
first a bottom-up campaign

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.476
where people will make small dollar commitments

00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:43.438
contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,

00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:45.438
and when those goals have been reached,

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:49.577
we will turn to the large dollar contributors,

00:11:49.577 --> 00:11:52.959
to get them to contribute to make it possible

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:56.482
for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:57.824
to win this issue,

00:11:57.824 --> 00:12:00.718
to change the way money influences politics,

00:12:00.718 --> 00:12:04.489
so that on November 8,

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.817
which I discovered yesterday is the day

00:12:06.817 --> 00:12:10.508
that Aaron would have been 30 years old,

00:12:10.508 --> 00:12:13.200
on November 8,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.739
we will celebrate 218 representatives

00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:18.826
in the House and 60 Senators

00:12:18.826 --> 00:12:20.847
in the United States Senate

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:23.140
who have committed to this idea

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.006
of fundamental reform.

00:12:25.006 --> 00:12:28.768
So last night, we heard about wishes.

00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:30.856
Here's my wish.

00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:34.100
May one.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.483
May the ideals of one boy

00:12:37.483 --> 00:12:41.964
unite one nation behind one critical idea

00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:44.425
that we are one people,

00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:47.902
we are the people who were promised a government,

00:12:47.902 --> 00:12:50.031
a government that was promised to be

00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:54.752
dependent upon the people alone, the people,

00:12:54.752 --> 00:12:57.601
who, as Madison told us,

00:12:57.601 --> 00:13:01.178
meant not the rich more than the poor.

00:13:01.178 --> 00:13:03.324
May one.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:07.503
And then may you, may you join this movement,

00:13:07.503 --> 00:13:09.511
not because you're a politician,

00:13:09.511 --> 00:13:11.127
not because you're an expert,

00:13:11.127 --> 00:13:14.419
not because this is your field,

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.099
but because if you are,

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:19.770
you are a citizen.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.807
Aaron asked me that.

00:13:22.807 --> 00:13:25.662
Now I've asked you.

00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:27.340
Thank you very much.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:35.385
(Applause)
