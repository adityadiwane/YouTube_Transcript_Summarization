00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So it's 1995,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I'm in college,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and a friend and I go on a road trip

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
from Providence, Rhode Island

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
to Portland, Oregon.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And you know, we're young and unemployed,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
so we do the whole thing on back roads

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
through state parks

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and national forests --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
basically the longest route we can possibly take.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I turn to my friend

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and I ask her a question

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that's been bothering me

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
for 2,000 miles.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.260
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
My friend looks at me totally blankly.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
There's actually a gentleman in the front row

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
(Laughter)

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And I'm like, "You know,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
all the signs we keep seeing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
with the Chinese character on them."

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
She just stares at me for a few moments,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and then she cracks up,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
because she figures out what I'm talking about.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And what I'm talking about is this.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Laughter)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
(Laughter)

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I've spent the last five years of my life

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
thinking about situations

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
exactly like this --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
why we sometimes misunderstand

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
the signs around us,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and how we behave when that happens,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and what all of this can tell us about human nature.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
In other words, as you heard Chris say,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I've spent the last five years

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
thinking about being wrong.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This might strike you as a strange career move,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
but it actually has one great advantage:

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
no job competition.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
(Laughter)

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
In fact, most of us do everything we can

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
to avoid thinking about being wrong,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that we ourselves are wrong.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
We get it in the abstract.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
But when it comes down to me, right now,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
to all the beliefs I hold,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
here in the present tense,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.260
suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
goes out the window --

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
We go to meetings in the present tense;

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
we go on family vacations in the present tense;

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
trapped in this little bubble

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of feeling very right about everything.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I think this is a problem.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
in our personal and professional lives,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So what I want to do today

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
inside this feeling of being right.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And second, why it's such a problem.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And finally, I want to convince you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
that it is possible

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
to step outside of that feeling

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and that if you can do so,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
it is the single greatest

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
So why do we get stuck

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
in this feeling of being right?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
So let me ask you guys something --

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
How does it feel -- emotionally --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
how does it feel to be wrong?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Dreadful. Thumbs down.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
thank you, these are great answers,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
but they're answers to a different question.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
You guys are answering the question:

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
How does it feel to realize you're wrong?

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.260
(Laughter)

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
it can actually be quite funny,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
like my stupid Chinese character mistake.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
But just being wrong

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
doesn't feel like anything.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I'll give you an analogy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
where there's this pathetic coyote

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And what's funny --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
at least if you're six years old --

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is that the coyote's totally fine too.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
He just keeps running --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
right up until the moment that he looks down

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and realizes that he's in mid-air.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
That's when he falls.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
When we're wrong about something --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
not when we realize it, but before that --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
we're like that coyote

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
You know, we're already wrong,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
we're already in trouble,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
but we feel like we're on solid ground.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It does feel like something to be wrong;

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
it feels like being right.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
(Laughter)

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
So this is one reason, a structural reason,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I call this error blindness.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Most of the time,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
we don't have any kind of internal cue

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
to let us know that we're wrong about something,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
until it's too late.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and this one is cultural.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Think back for a moment to elementary school.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You're sitting there in class,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
and one of them looks like this.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
This is not mine, by the way.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
(Laughter)

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So there you are in grade school,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and you know exactly what to think

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
about the kid who got this paper.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
the one who never does his homework.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So by the time you are nine years old,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
you've already learned, first of all,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that people who get stuff wrong

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and second of all,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
that the way to succeed in life

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
is to never make any mistakes.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.260
We learn these really bad lessons really well.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And a lot of us --

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.260
and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
deal with them by just becoming

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
perfect little A students,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
perfectionists, over-achievers.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Right,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:47.260
(Laughter)

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.260
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Okay, so fine.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Except that then we freak out

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Because according to this,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
getting something wrong

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
means there's something wrong with us.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So we just insist that we're right,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
because it makes us feel smart and responsible

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and virtuous and safe.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
So let me tell you a story.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
A couple of years ago,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Beth Israel's in Boston.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
one of the best hospitals in the country.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Everything seems to have gone fine.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
because the surgeon has performed a major operation

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
on her left leg instead of her right one.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
spoke about this incident,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
he said something very interesting.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
He said, "For whatever reason,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
the surgeon simply felt

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
that he was on the correct side of the patient."

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
(Laughter)

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
The point of this story

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
is that trusting too much in the feeling

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
of being on the correct side of anything

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
can be very dangerous.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
This internal sense of rightness

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that we all experience so often

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
is not a reliable guide

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
to what is actually going on in the external world.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And when we act like it is,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
well that's when we end up doing things

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.260
like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
or torpedoing the global economy.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
So this is a huge practical problem.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
But it's also a huge social problem.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
It means that you think that your beliefs

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
just perfectly reflect reality.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And when you feel that way,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
you've got a problem to solve,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
which is, how are you going to explain

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
all of those people who disagree with you?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
is we just assume they're ignorant.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
They don't have access to the same information that we do,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and when we generously share that information with them,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
When that doesn't work,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and they still disagree with us,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
then we move on to a second assumption,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
which is that they're idiots.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
(Laughter)

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And when that doesn't work,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
when it turns out that people who disagree with us

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
have all the same facts we do

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and are actually pretty smart,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
then we move on to a third assumption:

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
they know the truth,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and they are deliberately distorting it

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
for their own malevolent purposes.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
So this is a catastrophe.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
This attachment to our own rightness

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
keeps us from preventing mistakes

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
when we absolutely need to

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and causes us to treat each other terribly.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
But to me, what's most baffling

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and most tragic about this

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.260
is that it misses the whole point of being human.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
It's like we want to imagine

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and we just gaze out of them

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and describe the world as it unfolds.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and see the exact same thing.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
That is not true,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
The miracle of your mind

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
isn't that you can see the world as it is.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
We can remember the past,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
and we can think about the future,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
and we can imagine what it's like

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
to be some other person in some other place.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And we all do this a little differently,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
which is why we can all look up at the same night sky

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and see this

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and also this

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and also this.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
about "I think therefore I am,"

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
this guy, St. Augustine, sat down

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
"I err therefore I am."

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Augustine understood

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
that our capacity to screw up,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
it's not some kind of embarrassing defect

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
in the human system,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
something we can eradicate or overcome.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
It's totally fundamental to who we are.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Because, unlike God,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
we don't really know what's going on out there.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
And unlike all of the other animals,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.260
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
To me, this obsession

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
is the source and root

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
of all of our productivity and creativity.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
Last year, for various reasons,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
I found myself listening to a lot of episodes

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
of the Public Radio show This American Life.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
And so I'm listening and I'm listening,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and at some point, I start feeling

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
like all the stories are about being wrong.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And my first thought was,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
"I've lost it.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
I just imagined it everywhere,"

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
which has happened.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
But a couple of months later,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And I mentioned this to him,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and he was like, "No actually, that's true.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
In fact," he says,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
"as a staff, we joke

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
that every single episode of our show

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
has the same crypto-theme.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And the crypto-theme is:

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
'I thought this one thing was going to happen

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
and something else happened instead.'

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
We need these moments

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
of surprise and reversal and wrongness

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
to make these stories work."

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And for the rest of us, audience members,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
as listeners, as readers,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
we eat this stuff up.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
We love things like plot twists

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and red herrings and surprise endings.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
When it comes to our stories,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
we love being wrong.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
But, you know, our stories are like this

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
because our lives are like this.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
We think this one thing is going to happen

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and something else happens instead.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
And something else happened instead.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
And Hosni Mubarak

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
until he got too old or too sick

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And something else happened instead.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
And maybe you thought

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And something else happened instead.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And I have to tell you

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
about a subject everybody hates

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
for an audience that would never materialize.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
And something else happened instead.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
(Laughter)

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
I mean, this is life.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
For good and for ill,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.260
we generate these incredible stories

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
about the world around us,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and then the world turns around and astonishes us.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
No offense, but this entire conference

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
is an unbelievable monument

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
to our capacity to get stuff wrong.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
We just spent an entire week

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
talking about innovations and advancements

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and improvements,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
but you know why we need all of those innovations

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
and advancements and improvements?

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Because half the stuff

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
TED 1998 --

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
eh.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.260
(Laughter)

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Didn't really work out that way, did it?

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
(Laughter)

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
Where's my jet pack, Chris?

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.260
(Laughter)

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.260
(Applause)

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
So here we are again.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
And that's how it goes.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
We come up with another idea.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
We tell another story.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
We hold another conference.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
The theme of this one,

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
as you guys have now heard seven million times,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
is the rediscovery of wonder.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
And to me,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
if you really want to rediscover wonder,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
you need to step outside

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:14.260
of that tiny, terrified space of rightness

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and look around at each other

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
and look out at the vastness

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
and complexity and mystery

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
of the universe

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
and be able to say,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.260
"Wow, I don't know.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Maybe I'm wrong."

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
Thank you.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
(Applause)

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
Thank you guys.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
(Applause)
