Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.877
Growth is not dead.

00:00:14.877 --> 00:00:16.263
(Applause)

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.226
Let's start the story 120 years ago,

00:00:20.226 --> 00:00:23.858
when American factories began to electrify their operations,

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.202
igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:28.313
The amazing thing is

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:31.090
that productivity did not increase in those factories

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.346
for 30 years. Thirty years.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:37.820
That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.042
You see, the first wave of managers

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.459
simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.469
but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.810
of electricity's flexibility.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.794
It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.521
and then productivity soared,

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.186
often doubling or even tripling in those factories.

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:03.909
Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.139
like the steam engine before it.

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:09.555
General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:13.009
because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.641
like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:20.251
Is there a general purpose technology of our era?

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:22.759
Sure. It's the computer.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.418
But technology alone is not enough.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.184
Technology is not destiny.

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:29.764
We shape our destiny,

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:32.280
and just as the earlier generations of managers

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.578
needed to redesign their factories,

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.807
we're going to need to reinvent our organizations

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:39.362
and even our whole economic system.

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:42.964
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.

00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:44.194
As we'll see in a moment,

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:46.916
productivity is actually doing all right,

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.778
but it has become decoupled from jobs,

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:55.197
and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:57.716
These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:01.428
as the end of innovation,

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.557
but they are actually the growing pains

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:09.147
of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:11.029
Let's look at some data.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.931
So here's GDP per person in America.

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:16.697
There's some bumps along the way, but the big story

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:19.412
is you could practically fit a ruler to it.

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.688
This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.731
is actually an acceleration in real terms.

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:27.891
And here's productivity.

00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.562
You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:34.300
but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.991
when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.120
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.691
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,

00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:46.259
but sometimes it rhymes."

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.395
Today, productivity is at an all-time high,

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:51.372
and despite the Great Recession,

00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:55.624
it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:59.760
the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.434
It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.177
And that's just the United States.

00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:08.425
The global news is even better.

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:10.785
Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate

00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:13.281
in the past decade than ever in history.

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:18.332
If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:20.244
because the new machine age

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:21.908
is more about knowledge creation

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.239
than just physical production.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.177
It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,

00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:29.239
ideas not things.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.809
That creates a problem for standard metrics,

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:35.311
because we're getting more and more stuff for free,

00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:37.952
like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:41.015
and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:44.318
Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:46.083
Sure, of course it is.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:49.951
But that's not how economists measure GDP.

00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:55.543
Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.

00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:57.655
According to the numbers, the music industry

00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:00.655
is half the size that it was 10 years ago,

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:04.311
but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:06.503
You know, I bet you are too.

00:04:06.503 --> 00:04:09.226
In total, my research estimates

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:13.980
that the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.326
in free goods and services on the Internet.

00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.115
Now let's look to the future.

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.378
There are some super smart people

00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:26.397
who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,

00:04:26.397 --> 00:04:29.955
but to understand the future of growth,

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:32.638
we need to make predictions

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:35.928
about the underlying drivers of growth.

00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:39.734
I'm optimistic, because the new machine age

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:44.764
is digital, exponential and combinatorial.

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.028
When goods are digital, they can be replicated

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:51.537
with perfect quality at nearly zero cost,

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:55.555
and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.

00:04:55.555 --> 00:04:58.355
Welcome to the economics of abundance.

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:02.045
But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:06.645
Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:08.793
In the age of big data,

00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:13.079
we can measure the world in ways we never could before.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:17.174
Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.

00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:23.109
Computers get better faster than anything else ever.

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:26.677
A child's Playstation today is more powerful

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:30.733
than a military supercomputer from 1996.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:33.940
But our brains are wired for a linear world.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.828
As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.

00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:40.430
I used to teach my students that there are some things,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.364
you know, computers just aren't good at,

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:44.749
like driving a car through traffic.

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.762
(Laughter)

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:50.253
That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.637
because we just rode down Route 101

00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:56.306
in, yes, a driverless car.

00:05:56.306 --> 00:05:58.889
Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.937
The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,

00:06:02.937 --> 00:06:04.793
like low-hanging fruit,

00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:07.956
but the reality is that each innovation

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:11.212
creates building blocks for even more innovations.

00:06:11.212 --> 00:06:14.557
Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,

00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:16.629
an undergraduate student of mine

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.740
built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.439
He was able to do that so easily

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.266
because he built it on top of Facebook,

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:26.199
and Facebook was built on top of the web,

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.897
and that was built on top of the Internet,

00:06:27.897 --> 00:06:30.315
and so on and so forth.

00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:35.080
Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.430
would each be game-changers.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.620
Put them together, and we're seeing a wave

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.013
of astonishing breakthroughs,

00:06:41.013 --> 00:06:44.073
like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:46.869
or leap tall buildings in a single bound.

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.101
You know, robots are even revolutionizing

00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.930
cat transportation.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.200
(Laughter)

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.932
But perhaps the most important invention,

00:06:55.932 --> 00:07:00.997
the most important invention is machine learning.

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:04.373
Consider one project: IBM's Watson.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:05.962
These little dots here,

00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:10.822
those are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."

00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:13.366
At first, Watson wasn't very good,

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:18.988
but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:21.675
and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.327
to my class at MIT,

00:07:23.327 --> 00:07:26.869
Watson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:30.858
At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.

00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:36.176
Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.

00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:42.122
The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.

00:07:42.122 --> 00:07:44.396
Damn. (Laughter)

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.676
But you know, Watson is growing up fast.

00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:50.888
It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:54.612
It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,

00:07:54.612 --> 00:07:56.562
and getting some of them.

00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:58.451
Isn't it ironic that at the very moment

00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.685
we are building intelligent machines,

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:04.134
perhaps the most important invention in human history,

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:08.109
some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.528
Like the first two industrial revolutions,

00:08:10.528 --> 00:08:13.662
the full implications of the new machine age

00:08:13.662 --> 00:08:16.344
are going to take at least a century to fully play out,

00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:19.376
but they are staggering.

00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:22.712
So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?

00:08:22.712 --> 00:08:26.392
No. Technology is not destiny.

00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:28.961
Productivity is at an all time high,

00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:31.944
but fewer people now have jobs.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:35.064
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:38.968
but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.280
This is the great decoupling

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.256
of productivity from employment,

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:47.360
of wealth from work.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.706
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.552
have become disillusioned by the great decoupling,

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:54.299
but like too many others,

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.396
they misunderstand its basic causes.

00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.006
Technology is racing ahead,

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:03.556
but it's leaving more and more people behind.

00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:07.075
Today, we can take a routine job,

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:10.166
codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.993
and then replicate it a million times.

00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:15.272
You know, I recently overheard a conversation

00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:17.224
that epitomizes these new economics.

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:21.421
This guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&amp;R Block anymore.

00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.869
TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:28.427
but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."

00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:30.226
How can a skilled worker

00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:33.235
compete with a $39 piece of software?

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:35.202
She can't.

00:09:35.202 --> 00:09:37.982
Today, millions of Americans do have faster,

00:09:37.982 --> 00:09:40.369
cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:41.855
and the founders of Intuit

00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:44.348
have done very well for themselves.

00:09:44.348 --> 00:09:48.562
But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:50.640
That is a microcosm of what's happening,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.317
not just in software and services, but in media and music,

00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:59.003
in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --

00:09:59.003 --> 00:10:02.898
in short, in every industry.

00:10:02.898 --> 00:10:05.993
People are racing against the machine,

00:10:05.993 --> 00:10:09.083
and many of them are losing that race.

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:12.969
What can we do to create shared prosperity?

00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:15.986
The answer is not to try to slow down technology.

00:10:15.986 --> 00:10:18.543
Instead of racing against the machine,

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:22.220
we need to learn to race with the machine.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.349
That is our grand challenge.

00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:27.673
The new machine age

00:10:27.673 --> 00:10:30.786
can be dated to a day 15 years ago

00:10:30.786 --> 00:10:33.664
when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,

00:10:33.664 --> 00:10:37.370
played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.382
The machine won that day,

00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:42.350
and today, a chess program running on a cell phone

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.646
can beat a human grandmaster.

00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:48.011
It got so bad that, when he was asked

00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:50.574
what strategy he would use against a computer,

00:10:50.574 --> 00:10:54.590
Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.361
"I'd bring a hammer."

00:10:56.361 --> 00:11:00.041
(Laughter)

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:04.585
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.

00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:07.239
Neither is a human,

00:11:07.239 --> 00:11:10.818
because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament

00:11:10.818 --> 00:11:12.734
where teams of humans and computers

00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:14.833
could work together,

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:17.990
and the winning team had no grandmaster,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.455
and it had no supercomputer.

00:11:20.455 --> 00:11:24.630
What they had was better teamwork,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.646
and they showed that a team of humans and computers,

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:32.694
working together, could beat any computer

00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:36.214
or any human working alone.

00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:37.878
Racing with the machine

00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.221
beats racing against the machine.

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.785
Technology is not destiny.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.527
We shape our destiny.

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:45.974
Thank you.

00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:50.990
(Applause)
