00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
What I thought I would talk about today

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
is the transition from one mode

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
of thinking about nature

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
to another that's tracked by architecture. 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
What's interesting about architects is, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
we always have tried to justify beauty 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
by looking to nature,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
and arguably, beautiful architecture 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160
has always been looking at a model of nature. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
So, for roughly 300 years, 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
the hot debate in architecture

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
was whether the number five 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
or the number seven

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
was a better proportion to think about architecture, 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
because the nose was one-fifth of your head, 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
or because your head was one-seventh of your body. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And the reason that that was the model 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
of beauty and of nature

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
it wasn't the 16th century --

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and everybody had to dimension a building 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
in terms of fractions,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
so a room would be dimensioned 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
as one-fourth of a facade;

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.160
the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
and you would get down to the small elements 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
by fractional subdivision: 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
finer and finer and finer.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented; 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
architects stopped using fractions, 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and they had a new model of nature. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So, what's going on today 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
is that there's a model of natural form

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
which is calculus-based 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and which is using digital tools,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
and that has a lot of implications 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
to the way we think about beauty and form, 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic, 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus, 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
although the Gothic architects 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
weren't really using calculus to define their forms. 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
But what was important is, 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross: 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
the expression of structural force and form. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
which optimize structural form

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi, 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
the Catalan architect.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
The end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century, 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
and how that Hanging Chain model 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
translates into archways

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
and vaulting.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
So, in all of these examples, 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
structure is the determining force.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160
and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Interestingly, in the last 10 years

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.160
to generate the roof of the National Gallery, 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
with the structural engineer Chris Williams. 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
In all these examples, 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
there's one ideal form, 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
because these are thought in terms of structure. 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment. 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
So, what I thought I would bring up is 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
another component that needs to be thought of, 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
whenever you think about nature, 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
and that's basically the invention of 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
generic form in genetic evolution.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
My hero is actually not Darwin; 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
it's a guy named William Bateson,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.160
father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And he was what you'd call a teratologist: 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
or the ideal average,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule, 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb. 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Beautiful, because it has symmetry. 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations, 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
instead of having a thumb, 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
you would either get another opposable thumb,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
or you would get four fingers. 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
So, the mutations reverted to symmetry. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
And Bateson invented 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
the concept of symmetry breaking,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
which is that 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
wherever you lose information in a system,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
you revert back to symmetry. 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
So, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization --

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
which is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect --

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
symmetry was the absence of information. 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry; 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
whenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
from looking for ideal shapes 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
to looking for a combination of 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
information and generic form.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
You know, literally after seeing that image, 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
and finding out what Bateson was working with, 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
to start to think about architectural form. 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
To just talk for a minute about the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
digital mediums that we're using now 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
and how they integrate calculus:

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
the fact that they're calculus-based 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
means that we don't have to think about dimension 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
in terms of ideal units 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
or discreet elements.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So, in architecture we deal with

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
big assemblies of components, 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
so there might be up to, say, 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
50,000 pieces of material

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
in this room you're sitting in right now

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
that all need to get organized. 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same: 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
that every chair would be a slightly different dimension, 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting, 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
they're all losing their modular quality, 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions. 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
That's because we're all using calculus tools 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
for manufacturing and for design. 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Calculus is also a mathematics of curves. 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
So, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve. 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
It's just a curve without inflection.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
So, a new vocabulary of form

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
is now pervading all design fields:

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
you know, in the example of the nose to the face, 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
there's a fractional part-to-whole idea. 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
With calculus, the whole idea 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
of subdivision is more complex,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
because the whole and the parts are one continuous series. 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus, 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
so I brought some images to just describe how that works. 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
This is a Korean church that we did in Queens. 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
And in this example, you can see 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
that the components of this stair are repetitive, 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
but they're repetitive without being modular. 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Each one of the elements in this structure 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
is a unique distance and dimension, 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
and all of the connections are unique angles. 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Now, the only way we could design that, 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
or possibly construct it,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
is by using a calculus-based definition 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
of the form.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
It also is much more dynamic, 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
so that you can see that the same form opens and closes 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
in a very dynamic way as you move across it, 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
because it has this quality of vector in motion 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
built into it. 

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume, 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160
when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista. 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
And you also get a sense of

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
visual movement in the space,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern, 

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.160
so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar. 

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
I think that's one of the main changes, 

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
also, in architecture: 

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
like a Latin cross for a church, 

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
but actually all the traits of a church:

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
directionality that focuses you towards an altar. 

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
It turns out it's not rocket science

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
to design a sacred space.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits 

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
in a very kind of genetic way. 

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
So, these are the different perspectives of that interior, 

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
which has a very complex 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
set of orientations all in a simple form. 

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
In terms of construction and manufacturing, 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
this is a kilometer-long housing block 

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
that was built in the '70s in Amsterdam. 

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
And here we've broken the 500 apartments

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
up into small neighborhoods,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
and differentiated those neighborhoods. 

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects, 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
but what you can see is that 

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
the escalators and elevators

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
that circulate people along the face of the building 

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
are all held up by 

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.160
122 structural trusses.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Because we're using escalators

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
to move people,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.160
all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads. 

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped 

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
as you move down the length of the building. 

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
So, working with 

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
Bentley and MicroStation, 

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
we've written a custom piece of software 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
that networks all of the components together 

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
into these chunks of information, 

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
so that if we change any element 

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
along the length of the building,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
not only does that change distribute 

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
through each one of the trusses,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
but each one of the trusses then distributes that information 

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
down the length of the entire facade of the building.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
So it's a single calculation

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
for every single component of the building

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
that we're adding onto. 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
So, it's tens of millions of calculations

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel 

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
and another piece of structural steel. 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
But what it gives us is a harmonic 

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and synthesized

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
relationship of all these components, one to another. 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
This idea has, kind of, brought me into doing 

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
some product design,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
and it's because design firms

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
that have connections to architects,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
like, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company, 

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
and Alessi, which is a houseware company.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
They saw this actually solving a problem: 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
this ability to differentiate components

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
but keep them synthetic.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
So, not to pick on BMW, 

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
or to celebrate them,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
but take BMW as an example. 

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
They have to, in 2005,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
have a distinct identity 

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
for all their models of cars. 

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, 

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
the 100 series that's coming out, 

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
has to look like the 700 series,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
at the other end of their product line, 

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
so they need a distinct, coherent identity, 

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
which is BMW.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
for a 300-series car, 

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
and a person paying 70,000 dollars

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
for a 700 series,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
and that person paying more than double 

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
doesn't want their car to look too much like 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
the bottom-of-the-market car.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
So they have to also discriminate between these products. 

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
So, as manufacturing 

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
starts to allow more

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
design options,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
this problem gets exacerbated, 

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
of the whole and the parts.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
is all I think about,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
but in terms of product design

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160
So, the first kind of test product we did 

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
was with Alessi,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
which was for a coffee and tea set. 

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set; 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
down south in San Diego, 

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
and we used an exploded

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
titanium forming method 

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
that's used in the aerospace industry. 

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Basically what we can do, 

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
is just cut a graphite mold, 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.160
put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees, 

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
gently inflate titanium that's soft, 

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
and then explode it at the last minute into this form. 

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
But what's great about it is, 

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
the forms are only a few hundred dollars. 

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
So, we designed a system here 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160
of eight curves that could be swapped,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
very similar to that housing project I showed you, 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and we could recombine those together, 

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
so that we always had ergonomic shapes 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
that always had the same volume

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and could always be produced in the same way. 

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
a few hundred dollars, 

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
and get incredible variation in the components. 

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And this is one of those examples of the sets. 

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
So, for me, what was important is that 

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
this coffee set --

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
which is just a coffee pot, a teapot, 

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- 

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
that they would have a coherence --

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots -- 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
but that everyone who bought one 

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160
would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way. 

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
To go back to architecture, 

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
what's organic about architecture as a field, 

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
unlike product design, 

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.160
is this whole issue of holism 

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and of monumentality is really our realm.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
but also break down into small rooms 

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
and have an identity of both the big scale 

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
and the small scale.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.160
Architects tend to work with signature, 

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
so that an architect needs a signature 

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
and that signature has to work across the scale of houses 

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
up to, say, skyscrapers,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
and working with; and intricacy, 

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
which is the relationship of, say, 

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
the shape of a building, its structure, its windows, 

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.160
its color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems. 

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
So, my kind of hero for this in the natural world 

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
are these tropical frogs. 

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I got interested in them because they're the most 

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
extreme example

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
of a surface where

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160
the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration --

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works -- 

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
are all intricately connected to one another.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
So a change in the form 

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
indicates a change in the color pattern.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing, 

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
but they really work together and are fused

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
in some way.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
So, when doing a center 

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
for the national parks in Costa Rica, 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
we tried to use that idea of a gradient color 

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
and a change in texture

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
as the structure moves across the surface of the building. 

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
We also used a continuity of change 

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum, 

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
so it's all one continuous change 

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
in the massing,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
In a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.160
the different towers of housing fused together 

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
in shared curves so you get a single mass, 

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
like a kind of monolith,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
but it breaks down into individual elements. 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
And you can see that that change in massing 

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
also gives all 48 of the apartments 

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
a unique shape and size,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
but always within a, kind of, controlled limit, 

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
an envelope of change.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
I work with a group of other architects. 

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.160
We have a company called United Architects. 

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
And I think this just shows how 

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
we were approaching

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
the problem of incredibly large-scale construction. 

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral 

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. 

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
And to do that, we tried to connect up 

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160
the five towers into a single system.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.160
And we looked at, from the 1950s on, 

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
there were numerous examples of other architects 

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
trying to do the same thing.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
We really approached it at the level 

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
of the typology of the building,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.160
where we could build these five separate towers, 

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
but they would all join at the 60th floor 

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
and make a kind of single monolithic mass. 

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
With United Architects, also, 

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.160
we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters 

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
that used the same system, 

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
but this time in a much more monolithic mass, 

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
like a sphere.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
But again, you can see this, kind of, 

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
organic fusion

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
of multiple building elements

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.160
to make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts, 

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.160
but in an incredibly organic way. 

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
Finally, I'd like to just show you 

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
some of the effects of using digital fabrication. 

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.160
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills, 

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160
to just replace, kind of, 

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.160
young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. 

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.160
And I also bought a laser cutter 

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160
and started to fabricate within my own shop, 

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
kind of, large-scale building elements and models, 

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
where we could go directly to the tooling. 

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
What I found out is that the tooling, 

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
if you intervened in the software, 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
actually produced decorative effects. 

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160
So, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden, 

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.160
or this installation wall in the Netherlands 

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
at the Netherlands Architecture Institute, 

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
we could use the texture that the tool would leave 

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
to produce a lot of the spatial effects, 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
and we could integrate the texture of the wall 

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
with the form of the wall with the material. 

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.160
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass, 

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
and then even at the level of structural steel, 

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.160
which you think of as being linear and modular. 

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
The steel industry is so far 

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.160
ahead of the design industry

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160
that if you take advantage of it 

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
you can even start to think of beams and columns 

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
all rolled together into a single system

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
which is highly efficient,

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160
but also produces decorative effects

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
and formal effects 

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.160
that are very beautiful and organic.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
Thanks very much.
