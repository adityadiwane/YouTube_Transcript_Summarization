00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In fact what we're going to talk about,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
by a conversation than an address.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
many people have flocked to downtown New York to see

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There's a new place in New York

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
this was her number-one pick.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
JA: Even on the coldest winter days.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
To honor and remember.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is ours.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
a bit of a problem.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
JA: But that is about to change.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In record time,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a team of architects and construction workers

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and bring people closer.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Man: They'll get an incredible panorama

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and understand, I think more completely,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
most any other tourist site in America.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
people come here to see what's no longer there.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
when they see this is not as a construction site

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but as this incredibly moving burial ground.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with their own memorials the way they already have

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
along the current perimeter.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
JA: The ramps are made of simple material --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the kind of plywood you see at construction sites --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
which is really the whole point.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In the face of America's worst destruction

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
people are building again.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
an entertainment architect.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
DR: I like that word.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
felt on the 11th of September transmute

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
into your desire to do this thing?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I felt myself in the role originally --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and whose neighborhood was devastated,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and as someone who works less than a mile from there --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
about creating the places we had been creating.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure,"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We were really paralyzed.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
two days afterwards --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We gave the office a few days off.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And in discussing this with other architects,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we had seen people saying in the press

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that they should rebuild the towers as they were --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And I thought it was astonishing to speculate,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
as if this were a competition,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
on something that was such a fresh wound.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And I had a series of discussions --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and several other people --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but to help right now.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So we tried to come up with a way,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And that was the mission that we came up with.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
suddenly fulfilling needs?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
DR: Well what I was aware of was,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
there was this overwhelming need to act now.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
They moved to an abandoned school.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It was just extraordinary.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and it became this cathartic experience for us.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
KA: And that was done, effectively,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
by October 8 or something?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
DR: Yeah.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that you've designed to surround the site --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in New York real estate and New York politics.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
DR: Well, it's a funny thing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I sat in on several meetings.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And there were the most circuitous grand plans

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And it wasn't an inclusive group.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So we said, what is --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
KA: It was not an inclusive group?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
DR: It was not an inclusive group.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that was not representative of the city.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
KA: Shocking.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
DR: Yeah, surprising.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The city actually approached us.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We first approached the city about Pier 94.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We saw how PS 234 worked.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The families -- the victims of the families --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
KA: On the Hudson River?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and a way to protect it from the weather."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
where the families of the victims had left notes to them.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And there was no mediation between us and the experience.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
There was no filter.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And it was amazing how much harder it was

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to believe in real life than it was on TV.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
There was something about the comfort of the filter

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and how much information was between us and the experience.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So seeing this in a very simple,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
dignified way was a very powerful experience.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So we went back to the city and said

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but we've spent some time down there.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
At the same time the city had this need.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They were looking for a solution

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
There was a way -- there had to be a way --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to get people to move around the site.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It looks like a fairly simple thing,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but this was a half a million dollar project?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
it wasn't going to happen.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
by the end of the Giuliani administration,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and the Police Department and all of the --

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and they sensed that this needed to happen.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
we had to work with the families of the victims,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Because this didn't want to be a surprise.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
because the key was not raising a lot of objection

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and sort of working as quietly as possible.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
There needed to be a foundation in place.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
one major developer in New York --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And we met with him.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
volunteered to do it at cost.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And we said, "That's incredible!"

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And I think this was the 21st,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And we had to start construction the next day.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
about half the size that we had drawn it.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Laughter)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and a place to reflect and remember.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
which is just to the right -- and moving around the site.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And I think people were amazed at two things --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I think they were amazed at the destruction,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
but I think there was a sense of disbelief

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And we said, "Well, this is half the size,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it doesn't have any of the design features

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I convinced him that we should leave the room

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
with the agreement to build it as designed.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The next day I got an email from the developer

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
saying that he was withdrawing all funding.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
So we didn't know what to do,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
but we decided to cast a very wide net.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We emailed out letters to as many people as we could --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And we just felt it had to happen.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Richard, I think very correctly,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
made the point at the beginning --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
before all the chair designers came out --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It seems to me with this,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that it was the opposite of that.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
DR: Well here's the issue:

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
we knew that this was not in the sense of --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
a kind of quiet place.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So it led us to using design solutions

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that created as few filters between the viewer --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's all incredibly humble material.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's scaffolding and plywood.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
up by Saint Paul's and down the other side --

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to where you get the 360 degree view.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
we knew that these had to be moveable

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to respond to changing conditions,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
sort of sense of existence.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
This is clearly not a work for the ages.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Did that require, as an architect,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
a new way of thinking about what you were doing?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
To think of it as this purely temporary installation?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
DR: No, I don't think so.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I think this is, obviously, substantially different

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and all the people within the city --

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So the notion of collaboration --

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I think this reinforces how important that is.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And in terms of the temporary nature of it,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
our goal was not to create something

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
that would be there longer than it needed to be.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
about what's really happening there.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And I think regardless of what the position is about how

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
this sacred piece of land is to be used,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And that's what we were interested in.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So that, very much, is in the realm of things

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I've been interested in before.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
It enables that conversation to get serious.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And six months after the fact --

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
and only a few months away from the site being cleaned --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
we are very quickly, now, getting to the point

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
what should or shouldn't be done?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
KA: But it had some really terrible ideas.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
the dialogue is really opening up to,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
what does this site really want to be?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
KA: Well, I think that's interesting.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining --

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
a silver lining, here -- to rebuild

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
some more traditional city grid, or not?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
in a discussion of why we live in cities.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
collide up against us each day?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
regardless of what the number is.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
DR: Right, which the towers fell into.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
that they're not re-opening the street

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
to connect that back to the rest of the city.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I'd like to see an international competition,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and a call for ideas for uses.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
whether it's what amount of shopping?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
DR: Right. And we're looking for other things.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
in New York to do artist housing.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And find other ways to encourage the discussion

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
and more about a multiplicity of things.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
of the experience of being on this platform?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
So I thought that would be good to end with.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
KA: As you say, it's not a memorial.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Those kinds of forms?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
DR: We certainly did as much research as we could,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and we were conscious of other memorials.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
that expanded on Union Square

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000
and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
so that what you're aware of

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
but all of the buildings around it --

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
This shows Saint Paul's on the left.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
for making this happen and getting this done.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
and its being there,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
almost before you could believe

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
is part of its extraordinary --

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
I don't know if beauty is the word --

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
but presence.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
DR: It was an honor to do.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.
