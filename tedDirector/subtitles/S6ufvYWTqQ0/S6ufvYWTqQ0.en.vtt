00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.996
So I would like to start by telling you
about one of my greatest friends,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.660
Okoloma Maduewesi.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.156
Okoloma lived on my street

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.476
and looked after me like a big brother.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.540
If I liked a boy,
I would ask Okoloma's opinion.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.836
Okoloma died in the notorious
Sosoliso plane crash

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.220
in Nigeria in December of 2005.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.500
Almost exactly seven years ago.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.260
Okoloma was a person I could argue with,
laugh with and truly talk to.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.881
He was also the first person
to call me a feminist.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.756
I was about fourteen,
we were at his house, arguing.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.276
Both of us bristling
with half bit knowledge

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.660
from books that we had read.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.140
I don't remember what this
particular argument was about,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.196
but I remember
that as I argued and argued,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.780
Okoloma looked at me and said,
"You know, you're a feminist."

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.916
It was not a compliment.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.356
(Laughter)

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.716
I could tell from his tone,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.516
the same tone that you would use
to say something like,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.276
"You're a supporter of terrorism."

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.076
(Laughter)

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.756
I did not know exactly
what this word "feminist" meant,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.996
and I did not want Okoloma
to know that I did not know.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.036
So I brushed it aside,
and I continued to argue.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.476
And the first thing
I planned to do when I got home

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.076
was to look up the word
"feminist" in the dictionary.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.236
Now fast forward to some years later,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.396
I wrote a novel about a man
who among other things beats his wife

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.380
and whose story doesn't end very well.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.476
While I was promoting
the novel in Nigeria,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.516
a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
told me he wanted to advise me.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.436
And for the Nigerians here,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.956
I'm sure we're all familiar

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.220
with how quick our people are
to give unsolicited advice.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.036
He told me that people were saying
that my novel was feminist

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.676
and his advice to me --

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.876
and he was shaking his head
sadly as he spoke --

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.076
was that I should never
call myself a feminist

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.676
because feminists
are women who are unhappy

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.636
because they cannot find husbands.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.060
(Laughter)

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.540
So I decided to call myself
"a happy feminist."

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.516
Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.236
that feminism was not our culture

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.876
and that feminism wasn't African,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.836
and that I was calling myself a feminist

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.100
because I had been corrupted
by "Western books."

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.156
Which amused me,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.516
because a lot of my early readings
were decidedly unfeminist.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.756
I think I must have read every single
Mills &amp; Boon romance published

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.980
before I was sixteen.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.756
And each time I tried to read those books

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.596
called "the feminist classics,"

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.396
I'd get bored, and I really
struggled to finish them.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.156
But anyway, since feminism was un-African,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.660
I decided that I would now call myself
"a happy African feminist."

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.076
At some point I was a happy African
feminist who does not hate men

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.436
and who likes lip gloss

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.956
and who wears high heels
for herself but not for men.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.716
(Laughter)

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.916
Of course a lot of this
was tongue-in-cheek,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.556
but that word feminist is so heavy
with baggage, negative baggage.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.916
You hate men, you hate bras,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.060
you hate African culture,
that sort of thing.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.100
Now here's a story from my childhood.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.596
When I was in primary school,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.156
my teacher said at the beginning of term
that she would give the class a test

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.116
and whoever got the highest score
would be the class monitor.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.220
Now, class monitor was a big deal.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.796
If you were a class monitor,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.276
you got to write down
the names of noisemakers --

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.956
(Laughter)

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.460
which was having enough power of its own.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.076
But my teacher would also give you
a cane to hold in your hand

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.060
while you walk around
and patrol the class for noisemakers.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.060
Now, of course you were not
actually allowed to use the cane.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.156
But it was an exciting prospect
for the nine-year-old me.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.956
I very much wanted
to be the class monitor.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.900
And I got the highest score on the test.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.980
Then, to my surprise, my teacher said
that the monitor had to be a boy.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.156
She had forgotten
to make that clear earlier

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.038
because she assumed it was ... obvious.

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.116
(Laughter)

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.916
A boy had the second highest
score on the test,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.980
and he would be monitor.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.956
Now, what was even more
interesting about this

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.796
is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.779
who had no interest
in patrolling the class with the cane,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.140
while I was full of ambition to do so.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.476
But I was female and he was male,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.167
and so he became the class monitor.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.060
And I've never forgotten that incident.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.876
I often make the mistake of thinking

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.356
that something that is obvious to me
is just as obvious to everyone else.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.956
Now, take my dear friend Louis

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.316
for example.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.196
Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.716
and we would have conversations
and he would tell me,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.220
"I don't know what you mean by things
being different or harder for women.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.420
Maybe in the past, but not now."

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.956
And I didn't understand how Louis
could not see what seems so self-evident.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.116
Then one evening, in Lagos,
Louis and I went out with friends.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.596
And for people here
who are not familiar with Lagos,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.516
there's that wonderful Lagos' fixture,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.196
the sprinkling of energetic men
who hang around outside establishments

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.220
and very dramatically
"help" you park your car.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.116
I was impressed
with the particular theatrics

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.116
of the man who found us
a parking spot that evening.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.100
And so as we were leaving,
I decided to leave him a tip.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.996
I opened my bag,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.396
put my hand inside my bag,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.140
brought out my money
that I had earned from doing my work,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.340
and I gave it to the man.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.796
And he, this man who was
very grateful and very happy,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.596
took the money from me,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.036
looked across at Louis

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.916
and said, "Thank you, sir!"

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.420
(Laughter)

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.236
Louis looked at me, surprised,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.660
and asked, "Why is he thanking me?
I didn't give him the money."

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.620
Then I saw realization
dawn on Louis' face.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.276
The man believed that whatever money I had

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.820
had ultimately come from Louis.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.780
Because Louis is a man.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.236
Men and women are different.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.116
We have different hormones,
we have different sexual organs,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.196
we have different biological abilities.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.020
Women can have babies, men can't.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.836
At least not yet.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.276
(Laughter)

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.580
Men have testosterone and are
in general physically stronger than women.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.996
There's slightly more women
than men in the world,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.116
about 52 percent of the world's
population is female.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.540
But most of the positions of power
and prestige are occupied by men.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.116
The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.476
Wangari Maathai,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.620
put it simply and well when she said:

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.140
"The higher you go,
the fewer women there are."

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.356
In the recent US elections we kept hearing
of the Lilly Ledbetter law,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.796
and if we go beyond the nicely
alliterative name of that law,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.956
it was really about a man and a woman

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.756
doing the same job,
being equally qualified,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.180
and the man being paid more
because he's a man.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.316
So in the literal way, men rule the world,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.180
and this made sense a thousand years ago

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.796
because human beings lived then in a world

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.996
in which physical strength was
the most important attribute for survival.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.300
The physically stronger person
was more likely to lead,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.676
and men, in general,
are physically stronger.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.415
Of course there are many exceptions.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.996
(Laughter)

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.820
But today we live
in a vastly different world.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.596
The person more likely to lead
is not the physically stronger person;

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.116
it is the more creative person,
the more intelligent person,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.556
the more innovative person,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.236
and there are no hormones
for those attributes.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.876
A man is as likely as a woman
to be intelligent,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.860
to be creative, to be innovative.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.916
We have evolved;

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.460
but it seems to me that our ideas
of gender had not evolved.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.540
Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby
of one of the best Nigerian hotels.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.356
I thought about naming the hotel,
but I thought I probably shouldn't.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.740
And a guard at the entrance stopped me
and asked me annoying questions,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.596
because their automatic assumption is

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.740
that a Nigerian female walking
into a hotel alone is a sex worker.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.036
And by the way,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.196
why do these hotels
focus on the ostensible supply

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.660
rather than the demand for sex workers?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.595
In Lagos I cannot go alone
into many "reputable" bars and clubs.

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:49.036
They just don't let you in
if you're a woman alone,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.780
you have to be accompanied by a man.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.156
Each time I walk into
a Nigerian restaurant with a man,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.380
the waiter greets the man and ignores me.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.636
The waiters are products --

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.796
(Laughter)

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.716
At this some women
felt like, "Yes! I thought that!"

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.676
The waiters are products of a society

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.740
that has taught them that men
are more important than women.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.916
And I know that waiters
don't intend any harm.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.236
But it's one thing to know intellectually
and quite another to feel it emotionally.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.636
Each time they ignore me,
I feel invisible.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.860
I feel upset.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.876
I want to tell them
that I am just as human as the man,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.700
that I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.836
These are little things,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.116
but sometimes it's the little things
that sting the most.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.876
And not long ago, I wrote an article

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.196
about what it means
to be young and female in Lagos,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.140
and the printers told me,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.140
"It was so angry."

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.156
Of course it was angry!

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.940
(Laughter)

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.316
I am angry.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.476
Gender as it functions today
is a grave injustice.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.236
We should all be angry.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.116
Anger has a long history
of bringing about positive change;

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.940
but, in addition to being angry,
I'm also hopeful.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.316
Because I believe deeply
in the ability of human beings

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.460
to make and remake
themselves for the better.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.636
Gender matters everywhere in the world,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.316
but I want to focus on Nigeria

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.796
and on Africa in general,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.396
because it is where I know,
and because it is where my heart is.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.356
And I would like today to ask

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.516
that we begin to dream about
and plan for a different world,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.860
a fairer world,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.236
a world of happier men and happier women
who are truer to themselves.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.796
And this is how to start:

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.276
we must raise our daughters differently.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.660
We must also raise our sons differently.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.476
We do a great disservice to boys
on how we raise them;

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.340
we stifle the humanity of boys.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.876
We define masculinity
in a very narrow way,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.396
masculinity becomes this hard, small cage

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.716
and we put boys inside the cage.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.660
We teach boys to be afraid of fear.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.060
We teach boys to be afraid
of weakness, of vulnerability.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.476
We teach them to mask their true selves,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.740
because they have to be,
in Nigerian speak, "hard man!"

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.396
In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
both of them teenagers,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.916
both of them with the same amount
of pocket money, would go out

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.716
and then the boy
would be expected always to pay,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.380
to prove his masculinity.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.060
And yet we wonder why boys are more likely
to steal money from their parents.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.556
What if both boys and girls were raised

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.700
not to link masculinity with money?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.556
What if the attitude
was not "the boy has to pay"

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.340
but rather "whoever has more should pay?"

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.756
Now, of course because
of that historical advantage,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.236
it is mostly men who will have more today,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.876
but if we start
raising children differently,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.436
then in fifty years, in a hundred years,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.260
boys will no longer have the pressure
of having to prove this masculinity.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.516
But by far the worst thing we do to males,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.876
by making them feel
that they have to be hard,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.020
is that we leave them
with very fragile egos.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.340
The more "hard man"
the man feels compelled to be,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.740
the weaker his ego is.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.796
And then we do a much greater
disservice to girls

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.140
because we raise them
to cater to the fragile egos of men.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.516
We teach girls to shrink themselves,
to make themselves smaller,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.740
we say to girls,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.636
"You can have ambition, but not too much."

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.036
(Laughter)

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.756
"You should aim to be successful,
but not too successful,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.820
otherwise you would threaten the man."

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.436
If you are the breadwinner
in your relationship with a man,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.436
you have to pretend that you're not,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.116
especially in public,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.180
otherwise you will emasculate him.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.876
But what if we question
the premise itself?

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.220
Why should a woman's success
be a threat to a man?

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.556
What if we decide
to simply dispose of that word,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.300
and I don't think there's an English word
I dislike more than "emasculation."

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.836
A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.500
if I was worried that men
would be intimidated by me.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.116
I was not worried at all.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.396
In fact, it had not occurred
to me to be worried

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.636
because a man who would
be intimidated by me

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.276
is exactly the kind of man
I would have no interest in.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.516
(Laughter)

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.620
(Applause)

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.780
But still I was really struck by this.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.060
Because I'm female,
I'm expected to aspire to marriage;

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.556
I'm expected to make my life choices

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.660
always keeping in mind
that marriage is the most important.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.836
A marriage can be a good thing;

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.276
it can be a source of joy
and love and mutual support.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.756
But why do we teach girls
to aspire to marriage

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.500
and we don't teach boys the same?

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.836
I know a woman
who decided to sell her house

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.900
because she didn't want
to intimidate a man who might marry her.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.156
I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria
who, when she goes to conferences,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.556
wears a wedding ring

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.796
because according to her,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.740
she wants the other participants
in the conference to "give her respect."

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.276
I know young women
who are under so much pressure

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.396
from family, from friends,
even from work to get married,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.500
and they're pushed
to make terrible choices.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.956
A woman at a certain age who is unmarried,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.100
our society teaches her
to see it as a deep, personal failure.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.636
And a man at a certain age
who is unmarried,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.276
we just think he hasn't come around
to making his pick.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.156
(Laughter)

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.796
It's easy for us to say,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.076
"Oh, but women can
just say no to all of this."

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.540
But the reality is more difficult
and more complex.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.956
We're all social beings.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.476
We internalize ideas
from our socialization.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.476
Even the language we use

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.916
in talking about marriage
and relationships illustrates this.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.796
The language of marriage
is often the language of ownership

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.980
rather than the language of partnership.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.316
We use the word "respect"

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.116
to mean something a woman shows a man

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.220
but often not something
a man shows a woman.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.436
Both men and women in Nigeria will say --

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.756
this is an expression
I'm very amused by --

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.100
"I did it for peace in my marriage."

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.796
Now, when men say it,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.996
it is usually about something
that they should not be doing anyway.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.956
(Laughter)

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.756
Sometimes they say it to their friends,

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.716
it's something to say to their friends
in a kind of fondly exasperated way,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.876
you know, something that ultimately
proves how masculine they are,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.356
how needed, how loved.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.876
"Oh, my wife said
I can't go to the club every night,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.716
so for peace in my marriage,
I do it only on weekends."

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.436
(Laughter)

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.716
Now, when a woman says,
"I did it for peace in my marriage,"

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.276
she's usually talking
about giving up a job,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.756
a dream,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.140
a career.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.316
We teach females that in relationships,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.620
compromise is what women do.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.476
We raise girls to see
each other as competitors --

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.956
not for jobs or for accomplishments,
which I think can be a good thing,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.580
but for attention of men.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.676
We teach girls that they
cannot be sexual beings

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.196
in the way that boys are.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.540
If we have sons, we don't mind
knowing about our sons' girlfriends.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.636
But our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.276
(Laughter)

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.116
But of course when the time is right,

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.036
we expect those girls to bring back
the perfect man to be their husbands.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.436
We police girls,
we praise girls for virginity,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.396
but we don't praise boys for virginity,

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.325
and it's always made me wonder how exactly
this is supposed to work out because ...

00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.676
(Laughter)

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.660
(Applause)

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.980
I mean, the loss of virginity
is usually a process that involves ...

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.676
Recently a young woman
was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.396
I think some of us know about that.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.676
And the response of many young Nigerians,
both male and female,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.196
was something along the lines of this:

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.396
"Yes, rape is wrong.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.700
But what is a girl doing
in a room with four boys?"

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.860
Now, if we can forget
the horrible inhumanity of that response,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.820
these Nigerians have been raised
to think of women as inherently guilty,

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:22.275
and they have been raised
to expect so little of men

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.995
that the idea of men as savage beings
without any control

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.260
is somehow acceptable.

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:30.676
We teach girls shame.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.580
"Close your legs." "Cover yourself."

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.515
We make them feel
as though by being born female

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.636
they're already guilty of something.

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:39.995
And so, girls grow up to be women

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.156
who cannot see they have desire.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.060
They grow up to be women
who silence themselves.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.316
They grow up to be women
who cannot say what they truly think,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.676
and they grow up --

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.876
and this is the worst thing
we did to girls --

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.036
they grow up to be women
who have turned pretense into an art form.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.900
(Applause)

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.676
I know a woman who hates domestic work,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.196
she just hates it,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.940
but she pretends that she likes it,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.116
because she's been taught
that to be "good wife material"

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.516
she has to be --
to use that Nigerian word --

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.020
very "homely."

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.796
And then she got married,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.636
and after a while her husband's family
began to complain that she had changed.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.236
(Laughter)

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.716
Actually, she had not changed,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.660
she just got tired of pretending.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.676
The problem with gender,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.236
is that it prescribes how we should be

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
rather than recognizing how we are.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.676
Now imagine how much happier we would be,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.196
how much freer to be
our true individual selves,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.860
if we didn't have the weight
of gender expectations.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.836
Boys and girls are
undeniably different biologically,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.836
but socialization
exaggerates the differences

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.436
and then it becomes
a self-fulfilling process.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.500
Now, take cooking for example.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.596
Today women in general are more likely
to do the housework than men,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.876
the cooking and cleaning.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.476
But why is that?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.356
Is it because women
are born with a cooking gene?

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.796
(Laughter)

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.076
Or because over years they have been
socialized to see cooking as their role?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.676
Actually, I was going to say that maybe
women are born with a cooking gene,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.156
until I remember that the majority
of the famous cooks in the world,

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.476
whom we give the fancy title of "chefs,"

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.700
are men.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.476
I used to look up to my grandmother

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.556
who was a brilliant, brilliant woman,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.316
and wonder how she would have been

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.700
if she had the same opportunities
as men when she was growing up.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.356
Now today, there are
many more opportunities for women

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.636
than there were
during my grandmother's time

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.276
because of changes in policy,
changes in law,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.876
all of which are very important.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.436
But what matters even more
is our attitude, our mindset,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.756
what we believe
and what we value about gender.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.196
What if in raising children

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.020
we focus on ability instead of gender?

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.940
What if in raising children
we focus on interest instead of gender?

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.036
I know a family
who have a son and a daughter,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.956
both of whom are brilliant at school,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.876
who are wonderful, lovely children.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.436
When the boy is hungry,
the parents say to the girl,

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.676
"Go and cook Indomie noodles
for your brother."

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.916
(Laughter)

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.436
Now, the daughter doesn't
particularly like to cook Indomie noodles,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.236
but she's a girl, and so she has to.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.036
Now, what if the parents,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.676
from the beginning,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.620
taught both the boy and the girl
to cook Indomie?

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.756
Cooking, by the way,
is a very useful skill for boys to have.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.636
I've never thought it made sense
to leave such a crucial thing,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.556
the ability to nourish oneself --

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.796
(Laughter)

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.356
in the hands of others.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.300
(Applause)

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.436
I know a woman who has the same degree
and the same job as her husband.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.356
When they get back from work,
she does most of the housework,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.556
which I think is true for many marriages.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.316
But what struck me about them

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.316
was that whenever her husband
changed the baby's diaper,

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.620
she said "thank you" to him.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.276
Now, what if she saw this
as perfectly normal and natural

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.636
that he should, in fact,
care for his child?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.500
(Laughter)

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.996
I'm trying to unlearn
many of the lessons of gender

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.316
that I internalized when I was growing up.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.396
But I sometimes still feel very vulnerable
in the face of gender expectations.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.420
The first time I taught
a writing class in graduate school,

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.436
I was worried.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.796
I wasn't worried
about the material I would teach

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.156
because I was well-prepared,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.396
and I was going to teach
what I enjoy teaching.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.500
Instead, I was worried about what to wear.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.100
I wanted to be taken seriously.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.876
I knew that because I was female

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.060
I will automatically
have to prove my worth.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.316
And I was worried
that if I looked too feminine,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.116
I would not be taken seriously.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.476
I really wanted to wear
my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.316
but I decided not to.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.716
Instead, I wore a very serious,

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.316
very manly and very ugly suit.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.836
(Laughter)

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.556
Because the sad truth is
that when it comes to appearance

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.180
we start off with men
as the standard, as the norm.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.116
If a man is getting ready
for a business meeting,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.276
he doesn't worry
about looking too masculine

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.796
and therefore not being taken for granted.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.316
If a woman has to get ready
for business meeting,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.116
she has to worry
about looking too feminine

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.420
and what it says and whether or not
she will be taken seriously.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.020
I wish I had not worn
that ugly suit that day.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.396
I've actually banished it
from my closet, by the way.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.356
Had I then the confidence
that I have now to be myself,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.316
my students would have benefited
even more from my teaching,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.396
because I would have been more comfortable

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.420
and more fully and more truly myself.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.636
I have chosen to no longer
be apologetic for my femaleness

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.860
and for my femininity.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.500
(Applause)

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.476
And I want to be respected
in all of my femaleness

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.060
because I deserve to be.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.460
Gender is not an easy
conversation to have.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.476
For both men and women,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.436
to bring up gender is sometimes
to encounter almost immediate resistance.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.716
I can imagine some people here
are actually thinking,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.660
"Women too do sef."

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.516
Some of the men here might be thinking,

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.276
"OK, all of this is interesting,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.860
but I don't think like that."

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.996
And that is part of the problem.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.996
That many men do not
actively think about gender

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.516
or notice gender

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.556
is part of the problem of gender.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.236
That many men, say, like my friend Louis,

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.940
that everything is fine now.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.836
And that many men do nothing to change it.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.716
If you are a man and you walk
into a restaurant with a woman

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.420
and the waiter greets only you,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.716
does it occur to you to ask the waiter,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.300
"Why haven't you greeted her?"

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.636
Because gender can be --

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.740
(Laughter)

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.196
Actually, we may repose
part of a longer version of this talk.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.796
So, because gender can be
a very uncomfortable conversation to have,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.916
there are very easy ways to close it,
to close the conversation.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.116
So some people will bring up
evolutionary biology and apes,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.796
how, you know, female apes
bow down to male apes

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.060
and that sort of thing.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.756
But the point is we're not apes.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.196
(Laughter)

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.220
(Applause)

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.796
Apes also live on trees
and have earthworms for breakfast,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.020
and we don't.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.060
Some people will say,
"Well, poor men also have a hard time."

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.900
And this is true.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.076
But that is not what this --

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.196
(Laughter)

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.900
But this is not
what this conversation is about.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.076
Gender and class
are different forms of oppression.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.756
I actually learned quite a bit
about systems of oppression

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.236
and how they can be blind to one another

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.740
by talking to black men.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.316
I was once talking
to a black man about gender

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.716
and he said to me,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.196
"Why do you have to say
'my experience as a woman'?

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.436
Why can't it be

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.340
'your experience as a human being'?"

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.916
Now, this was the same man

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.940
who would often talk
about his experience as a black man.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.396
Gender matters.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.916
Men and women
experience the world differently.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.756
Gender colors the way
we experience the world.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.180
But we can change that.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.276
Some people will say,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.756
"Oh, but women have the real power,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.556
bottom power."

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.476
And for non-Nigerians,
bottom power is an expression

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.356
which I suppose means
something like a woman

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.140
who uses her sexuality
to get favors from men.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.740
But bottom power is not power at all.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.996
Bottom power means that a woman

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.916
simply has a good root to tap into,
from time to time --

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.380
somebody else's power.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.316
And then, of course, we have to wonder

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.996
what happens when
that somebody else is in a bad mood,

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.396
or sick

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.620
or impotent.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.516
(Laughter)

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:33.780
Some people will say that a woman
being subordinate to a man is our culture.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.436
But culture is constantly changing.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.116
I have beautiful twin nieces
who are fifteen and live in Lagos.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.100
If they had been born a hundred years ago

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.956
they would have been
taken away and killed.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.020
Because it was our culture,
it was our culture to kill twins.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.580
So what is the point of culture?

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.876
I mean there's the decorative,

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.516
the dancing ...

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.156
but also, culture really is about
preservation and continuity of a people.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.436
In my family,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.636
I am the child who is most interested
in the story of who we are,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.916
in our traditions,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.116
in the knowledge about ancestral lands.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.716
My brothers are not as interested as I am.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.180
But I cannot participate,

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.036
I cannot go to umunna meetings,

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.796
I cannot have a say.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.020
Because I'm female.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.996
Culture does not make people,

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.420
people make culture.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.516
So if it is in fact true --

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.036
(Applause)

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.676
So if it is in fact true

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.596
that the full humanity of women
is not our culture,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.340
then we must make it our culture.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.476
I think very often of my dear friend,
Okoloma Maduewesi.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.476
May he and all the others
who passed away in that Sosoliso crash

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.980
continue to rest in peace.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.300
He will always be remembered
by those of us who loved him.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.196
And he was right that day many years ago
when he called me a feminist.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.460
I am a feminist.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.916
And when I looked up the word
in the dictionary that day,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.196
this is what it said:

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.596
"Feminist: a person
who believes in the social, political

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.316
and economic equality of the sexes."

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.276
My great grandmother,
from the stories I've heard,

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.876
was a feminist.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.276
She ran away from the house of the man
she did not want to marry

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.380
and ended up marrying
the man of her choice.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.956
She refused, she protested, she spoke up

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.276
whenever she felt she was being deprived
of access, of land, that sort of thing.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.596
My great grandmother
did not know that word "feminist,"

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.540
but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.900
More of us should reclaim that word.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.260
My own definition of feminist is:

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.396
"A feminist is a man or a woman

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.620
who says --

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.436
(Laughter)

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.220
(Applause)

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.676
A feminist is a man or a woman who says,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.996
"Yes, there's a problem
with gender as it is today,

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.316
and we must fix it.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.060
We must do better."

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.836
The best feminist I know

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.180
is my brother Kene.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.636
He's also a kind,
good-looking, lovely man,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.420
and he's very masculine.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.356
Thank you.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.660
(Applause)
