00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.735
So, a few years ago I heard
an interesting rumor.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.597
Apparently, the head
of a large pet food company

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.876
would go into the annual
shareholder's meeting

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.361
with can of dog food.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.486
And he would eat the can of dog food.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.063
And this was his way of convincing them
that if it was good enough for him,

00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:29.764
it was good enough for their pets.

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:32.224
This strategy is now known
as "dogfooding,"

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.567
and it's a common strategy
in the business world.

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.075
It doesn't mean everyone
goes in and eats dog food,

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.320
but businesspeople
will use their own products

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:40.881
to demonstrate that they feel --

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:42.610
that they're confident in them.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.559
Now, this is a widespread practice,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:47.678
but I think what's really interesting
is when you find exceptions

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:48.853
to this rule,

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:51.584
when you find cases of businesses
or people in businesses

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:53.202
who don't use their own products.

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:56.347
Turns out there's one industry
where this happens in a common way,

00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:57.531
in a pretty regular way,

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:59.989
and that is the screen-based
tech industry.

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:04.407
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs,
when he was releasing the iPad,

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.173
described the iPad as a device
that was "extraordinary."

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:10.737
"The best browsing experience
you've ever had;

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.494
way better than a laptop,
way better than a smartphone.

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:15.045
It's an incredible experience."

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.854
A couple of months later,
he was approached by a journalist

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.034
from the New York Times,

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:20.557
and they had a long phone call.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.751
At the end of the call,

00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:25.165
the journalist threw in a question
that seemed like a sort of softball.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.764
He said to him, "Your kids
must love the iPad."

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.252
There's an obvious answer to this,

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.895
but what Jobs said
really staggered the journalist.

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.110
He was very surprised,

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:36.709
because he said, "They haven't used it.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.655
We limit how much technology
our kids use at home."

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.542
This is a very common thing
in the tech world.

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.001
In fact, there's a school
quite near Silicon Valley

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.298
called the Waldorf School
of the Peninsula,

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:51.486
and they don't introduce screens
until the eighth grade.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.552
What's really interesting about the school

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.625
is that 75 percent
of the kids who go there

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.716
have parents who are high-level
Silicon Valley tech execs.

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:02.677
So when I heard about this, I thought
it was interesting and surprising,

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.733
and it pushed me to consider
what screens were doing to me

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:07.714
and to my family and the people I loved,

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.000
and to people at large.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.946
So for the last five years,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.003
as a professor of business and psychology,

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:15.731
I've been studying the effect
of screens on our lives.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.791
And I want to start by just focusing
on how much time they take from us,

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:23.321
and then we can talk about
what that time looks like.

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.012
What I'm showing you here
is the average 24-hour workday

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:28.374
at three different points in history:

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.400
2007 -- 10 years ago --

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:31.883
2015

00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:34.925
and then data that I collected,
actually, only last week.

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.698
And a lot of things haven't changed

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:37.873
all that much.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.915
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half
to eight hours a day;

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.256
some people say that's declined slightly,
but it hasn't changed much.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.534
We work eight-and-a-half
to nine hours a day.

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:50.290
We engage in survival activities --

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:53.441
these are things like eating
and bathing and looking after kids --

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.621
about three hours a day.

00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.173
That leaves this white space.

00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:57.864
That's our personal time.

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.676
That space is incredibly important to us.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:03.988
That's the space where we do things
that make us individuals.

00:03:04.012 --> 00:03:07.113
That's where hobbies happen,
where we have close relationships,

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:10.019
where we really think about our lives,
where we get creative,

00:03:10.043 --> 00:03:11.857
where we zoom back and try to work out

00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:13.741
whether our lives have been meaningful.

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:15.593
We get some of that from work as well,

00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:17.532
but when people look back on their lives

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.560
and wonder what their lives have been like

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:20.827
at the end of their lives,

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:22.738
you look at the last things they say --

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:26.463
they are talking about those moments
that happen in that white personal space.

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:28.490
So it's sacred; it's important to us.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.365
Now, what I'm going to do is show you

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.641
how much of that space
is taken up by screens across time.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:34.990
In 2007,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.165
this much.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.169
That was the year that Apple
introduced the first iPhone.

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:40.391
Eight years later,

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.280
this much.

00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:44.927
Now, this much.

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.389
That's how much time we spend
of that free time in front of our screens.

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:51.716
This yellow area, this thin sliver,
is where the magic happens.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.322
That's where your humanity lives.

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.378
And right now, it's in a very small box.

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:57.688
So what do we do about this?

00:03:57.712 --> 00:03:59.069
Well, the first question is:

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:00.952
What does that red space look like?

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:03.081
Now, of course, screens are miraculous

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:04.533
in a lot of ways.

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:05.814
I live in New York,

00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:07.836
a lot of my family lives in Australia,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.290
and I have a one-year-old son.

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:13.212
The way I've been able to introduce
them to him is with screens.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.326
I couldn't have done that
15 or 20 years ago

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.508
in quite the same way.

00:04:16.532 --> 00:04:18.689
So there's a lot of good
that comes from them.

00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:20.559
One thing you can do is ask yourself:

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.666
What goes on during that time?

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.128
How enriching are the apps
that we're using?

00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:26.426
And some are enriching.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.892
If you stop people while
they're using them and say,

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:30.504
"Tell us how you feel right now,"

00:04:30.528 --> 00:04:32.924
they say they feel pretty good
about these apps --

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:36.308
those that focus on relaxation,
exercise, weather, reading,

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:37.875
education and health.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.033
They spend an average of nine
minutes a day on each of these.

00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:43.387
These apps make them much less happy.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.523
About half the people, when you interrupt
them and say, "How do you feel?"

00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:49.655
say they don't feel good about using them.

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:51.310
What's interesting about these --

00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.044
dating, social networking, gaming,

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:55.794
entertainment, news, web browsing --

00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:58.424
people spend 27 minutes a day
on each of these.

00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:02.000
We're spending three times longer
on the apps that don't make us happy.

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:03.692
That doesn't seem very wise.

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:07.244
One of the reasons we spend
so much time on these apps

00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:08.420
that make us unhappy

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:09.976
is they rob us of stopping cues.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.379
Stopping cues were everywhere
in the 20th century.

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:14.267
They were baked into everything we did.

00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:17.707
A stopping cue is basically a signal
that it's time to move on,

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.428
to do something new,
to do something different.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:23.648
And -- think about newspapers;
eventually you get to the end,

00:05:23.672 --> 00:05:25.969
you fold the newspaper away,
you put it aside.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:29.151
The same with magazines, books --
you get to the end of a chapter,

00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:31.952
prompts you to consider
whether you want to continue.

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:35.022
You watched a show on TV,
eventually the show would end,

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:37.451
and then you'd have a week
until the next one came.

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.229
There were stopping cues everywhere.

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:43.003
But the way we consume media today
is such that there are no stopping cues.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.318
The news feed just rolls on,

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:49.015
and everything's bottomless:
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.181
email, text messaging, the news.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:55.175
And when you do check
all sorts of other sources,

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.540
you can just keep going on and on and on.

00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:01.974
So, we can get a cue about what to do
from Western Europe,

00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:05.399
where they seem to have a number
of pretty good ideas in the workplace.

00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:07.831
Here's one example.
This is a Dutch design firm.

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:11.241
And what they've done
is rigged the desks to the ceiling.

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.417
And at 6pm every day,

00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.248
it doesn't matter who you're emailing
or what you're doing,

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:16.749
the desks rise to the ceiling.

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:17.881
(Laughter)

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:19.155
(Applause)

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.422
Four days a week, the space
turns into a yoga studio,

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.077
one day a week, into a dance club.

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:27.630
It's really up to you which ones
you stick around for.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:29.341
But this is a great stopping rule,

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:31.252
because it means at the end of the day,

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:33.313
everything stops, there's no way to work.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:36.781
At Daimler, the German car company,
they've got another great strategy.

00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:38.335
When you go on vacation,

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:40.563
instead of saying,
"This person's on vacation,

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:42.310
they'll get back to you eventually,"

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:45.556
they say, "This person's on vacation,
so we've deleted your email.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.226
This person will never see
the email you just sent."

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.266
(Laughter)

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.931
"You can email back in a couple of weeks,

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:53.441
or you can email someone else."

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:54.493
(Laughter)

00:06:54.517 --> 00:06:55.689
And so --

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:59.355
(Applause)

00:07:00.702 --> 00:07:02.340
You can imagine what that's like.

00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:04.822
You go on vacation,
and you're actually on vacation.

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:06.815
The people who work at this company feel

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.201
that they actually get a break from work.

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.142
But of course, that doesn't tell us much

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.465
about what we should do
at home in our own lives,

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:15.171
so I want to make some suggestions.

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:19.688
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm,
I'm going to not use my phone.

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:23.143
The problem is, 5 and 6pm
looks different on different days.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.354
I think a far better strategy is to say,

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.847
I do certain things every day,

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.225
there are certain occasions
that happen every day,

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:30.508
like eating dinner.

00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:31.850
Sometimes I'll be alone,

00:07:31.874 --> 00:07:33.380
sometimes with other people,

00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:34.683
sometimes in a restaurant,

00:07:34.707 --> 00:07:35.895
sometimes at home,

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.565
but the rule that I've adopted is:
I will never use my phone at the table.

00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:41.377
It's far away,

00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:42.862
as far away as possible.

00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:45.195
Because we're really bad
at resisting temptation.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.290
But when you have a stopping cue
that, every time dinner begins,

00:07:48.314 --> 00:07:49.470
my phone goes far away,

00:07:49.494 --> 00:07:51.162
you avoid temptation all together.

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:52.903
At first, it hurts.

00:07:52.927 --> 00:07:54.549
I had massive FOMO.

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:55.639
(Laughter)

00:07:55.663 --> 00:07:56.829
I struggled.

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.119
But what happens is, you get used to it.

00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:02.241
You overcome the withdrawal
the same way you would from a drug,

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:05.050
and what happens is, life becomes
more colorful, richer,

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:06.229
more interesting --

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:07.903
you have better conversations.

00:08:07.927 --> 00:08:10.951
You really connect with the people
who are there with you.

00:08:10.975 --> 00:08:12.619
I think it's a fantastic strategy,

00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:15.132
and we know it works,
because when people do this --

00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:17.746
and I've tracked a lot of people
who have tried this --

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.940
it expands.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.280
They feel so good about it,

00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:23.396
they start doing it for the first
hour of the day in the morning.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.545
They start putting their phones
on airplane mode on the weekend.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:30.306
That way, your phone remains a camera,
but it's no longer a phone.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.665
It's a really powerful idea,

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:35.318
and we know people feel much better
about their lives when they do this.

00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:37.382
So what's the take home here?

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:39.645
Screens are miraculous;
I've already said that,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.021
and I feel that it's true.

00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:45.665
But the way we use them is a lot like
driving down a really fast, long road,

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:48.852
and you're in a car where the accelerator
is mashed to the floor,

00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:50.924
it's kind of hard
to reach the brake pedal.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:52.440
You've got a choice.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.493
You can either glide by, past,
say, the beautiful ocean scenes

00:08:57.517 --> 00:09:00.613
and take snaps out the window --
that's the easy thing to do --

00:09:00.637 --> 00:09:04.177
or you can go out of your way
to move the car to the side of the road,

00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.673
to push that brake pedal,

00:09:05.697 --> 00:09:06.850
to get out,

00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:08.755
take off your shoes and socks,

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.044
take a couple of steps onto the sand,

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:13.308
feel what the sand feels like
under your feet,

00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:14.483
walk to the ocean,

00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:16.620
and let the ocean lap at your ankles.

00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:19.842
Your life will be richer
and more meaningful

00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:22.084
because you breathe in that experience,

00:09:22.108 --> 00:09:24.504
and because you've left
your phone in the car.

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:25.699
Thank you.

00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.024
(Applause)
