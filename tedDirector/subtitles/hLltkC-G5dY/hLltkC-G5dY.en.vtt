00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.696
(Music)

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.416
Roughly 43,000 years ago,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.416
a young cave bear
died in the rolling hills

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.816
on the northwest border
of modern day Slovenia.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.936
A thousand years later,
a mammoth died in southern Germany.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.256
A few centuries after that,
a griffon vulture also died

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.480
in the same vicinity.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.416
And we know almost nothing
about how these animals met their deaths,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.496
but these different creatures
dispersed across both time and space

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.696
did share one remarkable fate.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.176
After their deaths,
a bone from each of their skeletons

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.896
was crafted by human hands

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.120
into a flute.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.376
Think about that for a second.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.056
Imagine you're a caveman,
40,000 years ago.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.736
You've mastered fire.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.816
You've built simple tools for hunting.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.456
You've learned how to craft
garments from animal skins

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.536
to keep yourself warm in the winter.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.296
What would you choose to invent next?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.456
It seems preposterous
that you would invent the flute,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.296
a tool that created
useless vibrations in air molecules.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.320
But that is exactly
what our ancestors did.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.616
Now this turns out
to be surprisingly common

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.256
in the history of innovation.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.216
Sometimes people invent things

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.176
because they want to stay alive
or feed their children

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.336
or conquer the village next door.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.776
But just as often,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.696
new ideas come into the world

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.760
simply because they're fun.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.936
And here's the really strange thing:

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.216
many of those playful
but seemingly frivolous inventions

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.856
ended up sparking
momentous transformations

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.976
in science, in politics and society.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.936
Take what may be the most
important invention of modern times:

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.696
programmable computers.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.336
Now, the standard story is that computers
descend from military technology,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.216
since many of the early computers
were designed specifically

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.696
to crack wartime codes
or calculate rocket trajectories.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.216
But in fact, the origins
of the modern computer

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.896
are much more playful,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.216
even musical,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.496
than you might imagine.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.776
The idea behind the flute,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.896
of just pushing air through tubes
to make a sound,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.816
was eventually modified
to create the first organ

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.576
more than 2,000 years ago.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.896
Someone came up with the brilliant idea
of triggering sounds

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.816
by pressing small levers with our fingers,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.216
inventing the first musical keyboard.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.376
Now, keyboards evolved
from organs to clavichords to harpsichords

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.736
to the piano,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.416
until the middle of the 19th century,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.216
when a bunch of inventors
finally hit on the idea

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.136
of using a keyboard
to trigger not sounds but letters.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.456
In fact, the very first typewriter

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.640
was originally called
"the writing harpsichord."

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.256
Flutes and music led
to even more powerful breakthroughs.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.016
About a thousand years ago,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.256
at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.616
three brothers in Baghdad
designed a device

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.136
that was an automated organ.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.040
They called it "the instrument
that plays itself."

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.096
Now, the instrument
was basically a giant music box.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.456
The organ could be trained to play
various songs by using instructions

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.680
encoded by placing pins
on a rotating cylinder.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.056
And if you wanted the machine
to play a different song,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.040
you just swapped a new cylinder in
with a different code on it.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.216
This instrument was the first of its kind.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.976
It was programmable.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.056
Now, conceptually,
this was a massive leap forward.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.496
The whole idea of hardware and software

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.736
becomes thinkable for the first time
with this invention.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.216
And that incredibly powerful concept

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.416
didn't come to us as an instrument
of war or of conquest,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.136
or necessity at all.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.296
It came from the strange delight
of watching a machine play music.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.536
In fact, the idea of programmable machines

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.216
was exclusively kept alive by music
for about 700 years.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.736
In the 1700s, music-making machines

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.336
became the playthings
of the Parisian elite.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.536
Showmen used the same coded cylinders

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.496
to control the physical movements
of what were called automata,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.536
an early kind of robot.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.496
One of the most famous of those robots

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.896
was, you guessed it,
an automated flute player

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.816
designed by a brilliant French inventor

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.125
named Jacques de Vaucanson.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.776
And as de Vaucanson
was designing his robot musician,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.736
he had another idea.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.736
If you could program a machine
to make pleasing sounds,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.400
why not program it to weave
delightful patterns of color out of cloth?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.176
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder
to represent musical notes,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.296
they would represent
threads with different colors.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.816
If you wanted a new pattern
for your fabric,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.520
you just programmed a new cylinder.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.840
This was the first programmable loom.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.736
Now, the cylinders were too expensive
and time-consuming to make,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.296
but a half century later,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.936
another French inventor named Jacquard

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.656
hit upon the brilliant idea
of using paper-punched cards

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.456
instead of metal cylinders.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.536
Paper turned out to be
much cheaper and more flexible

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.696
as a way of programming the device.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.176
That punch card system inspired
Victorian inventor Charles Babbage

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.696
to create his analytical engine,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.336
the first true programmable computer

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.696
ever designed.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.416
And punch cards were used
by computer programmers

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.520
as late as the 1970s.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.776
So ask yourself this question:

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.296
what really made
the modern computer possible?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.336
Yes, the military involvement
is an important part of the story,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.096
but inventing a computer
also required other building blocks:

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.336
music boxes,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.376
toy robot flute players,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.896
harpsichord keyboards,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.496
colorful patterns woven into fabric,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.336
and that's just a small part of the story.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.336
There's a long list of world-changing
ideas and technologies

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.056
that came out of play:

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.056
public museums, rubber,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.416
probability theory, the insurance business

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.656
and many more.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.400
Necessity isn't always
the mother of invention.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.256
The playful state of mind
is fundamentally exploratory,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.240
seeking out new possibilities
in the world around us.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.416
And that seeking
is why so many experiences

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.456
that started with simple
delight and amusement

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.240
eventually led us
to profound breakthroughs.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.256
Now, I think this has implications
for how we teach kids in school

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.640
and how we encourage innovation
in our workspaces,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.576
but thinking about play
and delight this way

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.136
also helps us detect what's coming next.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.536
Think about it: if you were
sitting there in 1750

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.096
trying to figure out
the big changes coming to society

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.016
in the 19th, the 20th centuries,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.096
automated machines, computers,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.056
artificial intelligence,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.896
a programmable flute

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.096
entertaining the Parisian elite

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.920
would have been as powerful a clue
as anything else at the time.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.376
It seemed like an amusement at best,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.136
not useful in any serious way,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.016
but it turned out to be
the beginning of a tech revolution

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.896
that would change the world.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.776
You'll find the future

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800
wherever people are having the most fun.
