00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.858
I and my colleagues Art Aron
and Lucy Brown and others,

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:27.439
have put 37 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:31.336
17 who were happily in love,
15 who had just been dumped,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.496
and we're just starting
our third experiment:

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.026
studying people who report
that they're still in love

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.306
after 10 to 25 years of marriage.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.306
So, this is the short story
of that research.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.652
In the jungles of Guatemala,
in Tikal, stands a temple.

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:52.421
It was built by the grandest Sun King,
of the grandest city-state,

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:56.300
of the grandest civilization
of the Americas, the Mayas.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.415
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:01.725
He stood over six feet tall.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:04.124
He lived into his 80s,

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:08.079
and he was buried beneath
this monument in 720 AD.

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:12.564
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim
that he was deeply in love with his wife.

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:15.988
So, he built a temple
in her honor, facing his.

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:20.417
And every spring and autumn,
exactly at the equinox,

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:22.876
the sun rises behind his temple,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.936
and perfectly bathes her temple
with his shadow.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.711
And as the sun sets
behind her temple in the afternoon,

00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:35.374
it perfectly bathes
his temple with her shadow.

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:41.854
After 1,300 years, these two lovers
still touch and kiss from their tomb.

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:45.099
Around the world, people love.

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.867
They sing for love, they dance for love,

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:50.899
they compose poems and stories about love.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.498
They tell myths and legends about love.

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:59.023
They pine for love, they live for love,
they kill for love, and they die for love.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:03.482
As Walt Whitman once said,
"O I would stake all for you."

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:08.306
Anthropologists have found evidence
of romantic love in 170 societies.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.882
They've never found a society
that did not have it.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:15.146
But love isn't always a happy experience.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.069
In one study of college students,
they asked a lot of questions about love,

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:22.032
but the two that stood out
to me the most were:

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:26.224
"Have you ever been rejected
by somebody who you really loved?"

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:28.103
And the second question was:

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.641
"Have you ever dumped somebody
who really loved you?"

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:36.733
And almost 95 percent of both men
and women said yes to both.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.905
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.

00:02:40.858 --> 00:02:44.113
So, before I start telling you
about the brain,

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:45.597
I want to read for you

00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.306
what I think is the most powerful
love poem on Earth.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.147
There's other love poems that are,
of course, just as good,

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.365
but I don't think this one
can be surpassed.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:58.454
It was told by an anonymous
Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.396
to a missionary in 1896.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.193
And here it is.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:05.949
I've never had the opportunity
to say it before.

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:10.378
"Fire runs through my body
with the pain of loving you.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.946
Pain runs through my body
with the fires of my love for you.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.813
Pain like a boil about to burst
with my love for you,

00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:21.928
consumed by fire with my love for you.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:24.058
I remember what you said to me.

00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:26.167
I am thinking of your love for me.

00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:28.516
I am torn by your love for me.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.478
Pain and more pain --

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.539
where are you going with my love?

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:34.339
I am told you will go from here.

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:36.806
I am told you will leave me here.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.995
My body is numb with grief.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.078
Remember what I said, my love.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:43.206
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:49.324
Emily Dickinson once wrote,
"Parting is all we need to know of hell."

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.304
How many people have suffered

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:56.306
in all the millions of years
of human evolution?

00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:59.082
How many people around the world

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.971
are dancing with elation
at this very minute?

00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:06.239
Romantic love is one of the most powerful
sensations on Earth.

00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:10.141
So, several years ago,
I decided to look into the brain

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:12.695
and study this madness.

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.606
Our first study of people
who were happily in love

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.971
has been widely publicized,

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.489
so I'm only going to say
very little about it.

00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:23.493
We found activity in a tiny,
little factory near the base of the brain

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:25.663
called the ventral tegmental area.

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:28.831
We found activity in some cells
called the A10 cells,

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:31.784
cells that actually make
dopamine, a natural stimulant,

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.084
and spray it to many brain regions.

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:38.219
Indeed, this part, the VTA,
is part of the brain's reward system.

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.816
It's way below your cognitive
thinking process.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.431
It's below your emotions.

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:45.684
It's part of what we call
the reptilian core of the brain,

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:50.954
associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving.

00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:54.084
In fact, the same brain region
where we found activity

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:57.306
becomes active also
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:00.924
But romantic love is much more
than a cocaine high --

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.259
at least you come down from cocaine.

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:06.564
Romantic love is an obsession,
it possesses you.

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:08.247
You lose your sense of self.

00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:11.639
You can't stop thinking
about another human being.

00:05:11.663 --> 00:05:14.056
Somebody is camping in your head.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.045
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
"My longing had no time when it ceases."

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.305
Wild is love.

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:26.054
And the obsession can get worse
when you've been rejected.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:31.306
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,
the neuroscientists on our project,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.307
are looking at the data of the people

00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:36.662
who were put into the machine
after they had just been dumped.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:39.887
It was very difficult actually,
putting these people in the machine,

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.646
because they were in such bad shape.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.630
(Laughter)

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.949
So anyway, we found activity
in three brain regions.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.444
We found activity in the brain region,

00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:55.059
in exactly the same brain region
associated with intense romantic love.

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.306
What a bad deal.

00:05:56.983 --> 00:05:58.631
You know, when you've been dumped,

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:01.852
the one thing you love to do
is just forget about this human being,

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:05.082
and then go on with your life --
but no, you just love them harder.

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:09.493
As the poet Terence,
the Roman poet once said,

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:12.534
he said, "The less my hope,
the hotter my love."

00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:14.794
And indeed, we now know why.

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:18.036
Two thousand years later,
we can explain this in the brain.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.459
That brain system -- the reward system

00:06:20.483 --> 00:06:24.306
for wanting, for motivation,
for craving, for focus --

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.792
becomes more active
when you can't get what you want.

00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:32.069
In this case, life's greatest prize:
an appropriate mating partner.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.358
We found activity
in other brain regions also --

00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:40.274
in a brain region associated
with calculating gains and losses.

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:42.645
You're lying there,
you're looking at the picture,

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:43.978
and you're in this machine,

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:46.175
and you're calculating what went wrong.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.747
What have I lost?

00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.419
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I
have a little joke about this.

00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:55.306
It comes from a David Mamet play,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.404
and there's two con artists in the play,

00:06:57.428 --> 00:06:59.306
and the woman is conning the man,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.511
and the man looks at the woman and says,

00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:06.130
"Oh, you're a bad pony,
I'm not going to bet on you."

00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:09.081
And indeed, it's this part of the brain,

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:11.011
the core of the nucleus accumbens,

00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:14.225
that is becoming active
as you're measuring your gains and losses.

00:07:14.657 --> 00:07:17.003
It's also the brain region
that becomes active

00:07:17.027 --> 00:07:21.924
when you're willing to take enormous risks
for huge gains and huge losses.

00:07:21.948 --> 00:07:25.210
Last but not least,
we found activity in a brain region

00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:28.943
associated with deep attachment
to another individual.

00:07:29.913 --> 00:07:36.036
No wonder people suffer around the world,
and we have so many crimes of passion.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.176
When you've been rejected in love,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.129
not only are you engulfed
with feelings of romantic love,

00:07:42.153 --> 00:07:44.907
but you're feeling deep
attachment to this individual.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.178
Moreover, this brain circuit
for reward is working,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:53.378
and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation

00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:57.909
and the willingness to risk it all,
to win life's greatest prize.

00:07:59.807 --> 00:08:02.701
So, what have I learned
from this experiment

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:04.447
that I would like to tell the world?

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:06.849
Foremost, I have come to think

00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:10.295
that romantic love is a drive,
a basic mating drive.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.495
Not the sex drive --

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:14.389
the sex drive gets you looking
for a whole range of partners.

00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:16.919
Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy

00:08:16.943 --> 00:08:19.741
on just one at a time,
conserve your mating energy,

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.423
and start the mating process
with this single individual.

00:08:23.447 --> 00:08:27.064
I think of all the poetry
that I've read about romantic love,

00:08:27.088 --> 00:08:30.910
what sums it up best
is something that is said by Plato

00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:33.037
over 2,000 years ago.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:36.306
He said, "The god of love
lives in a state of need.

00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:42.459
It is a need, it is an urge,
it is a homeostatic imbalance.

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:46.459
Like hunger and thirst,
it's almost impossible to stamp out."

00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:50.698
I've also come to believe
that romantic love is an addiction:

00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:53.269
a perfectly wonderful addiction
when it's going well,

00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:56.365
and a perfectly horrible addiction
when it's going poorly.

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.177
And indeed, it has all
of the characteristics of addiction.

00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:02.554
You focus on the person,
you obsessively think about them,

00:09:02.578 --> 00:09:05.306
you crave them, you distort reality,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.273
your willingness to take enormous
risks to win this person.

00:09:08.654 --> 00:09:11.341
And it's got the three main
characteristics of addiction:

00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:14.046
tolerance, you need to see them
more, and more, and more;

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.607
withdrawals;

00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:17.029
and last: relapse.

00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:20.679
I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair.

00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:23.586
It's been about eight months,
she's beginning to feel better.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.076
And she was driving along
in her car the other day,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.268
and suddenly she heard a song
on the car radio

00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:29.727
that reminded her of this man.

00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:32.614
Not only did the instant
craving come back,

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:36.188
but she had to pull over
from the side of the road and cry.

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:39.071
So, one thing I would like
the medical community,

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.794
and the legal community,
and even the college community,

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:45.631
to see if they can understand,
that indeed, romantic love

00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:48.721
is one of the most addictive
substances on Earth.

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:51.771
I would also like to tell the world
that animals love.

00:09:52.464 --> 00:09:54.635
There's not an animal on this planet

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:57.055
that will copulate with anything
that comes along.

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:01.776
Too old, too young, too scruffy,
too stupid, and they won't do it.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.306
Unless you're stuck
in a laboratory cage --

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.026
and you know, if you spend
your entire life in a little box,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.306
you're not going to be as picky
about who you have sex with,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.207
but I've looked in a hundred species,

00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:17.306
and everywhere in the wild,
animals have favorites.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.333
As a matter of fact,
ethologists know this.

00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:23.306
There are over eight words
for what they call "animal favoritism:"

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.819
selective proceptivity, mate choice,
female choice, sexual choice.

00:10:28.843 --> 00:10:31.819
And indeed, there are now
three academic articles

00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:34.306
in which they've looked
at this attraction,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.306
which may only last for a second,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.041
but it's a definite attraction,

00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:41.347
and either this same brain region,
this reward system,

00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:44.924
or the chemicals of that reward
system are involved.

00:10:44.948 --> 00:10:47.562
In fact, I think animal attraction
can be instant --

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:50.306
you can see an elephant
instantly go for another elephant.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
And I think that this is really the origin

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:55.495
of what you and I call
"love at first sight."

00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:58.884
People have often asked me

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.912
whether what I know about love
has spoiled it for me.

00:11:02.936 --> 00:11:04.946
And I just simply say, "Hardly."

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.095
You can know every single ingredient
in a piece of chocolate cake,

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:10.814
and then when you sit down
and eat that cake,

00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:12.657
you can still feel that joy.

00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:16.339
And certainly, I make all the same
mistakes that everybody else does too,

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:20.602
but it's really deepened my understanding

00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:24.552
and compassion, really,
for all human life.

00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:27.825
As a matter of fact, in New York,
I often catch myself

00:11:27.849 --> 00:11:31.410
looking in baby carriages
and feeling a little sorry for the tot.

00:11:31.434 --> 00:11:34.306
And in fact, sometimes
I feel a little sorry

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.329
for the chicken on my dinner plate,

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:40.875
when I think of how intense
this brain system is.

00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:46.246
Our newest experiment has been hatched

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.924
by my colleague, Art Aron --

00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:52.109
putting people who are reporting
that they are still in love,

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:55.271
in a long-term relationship,
into the functional MRI.

00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:57.648
We've put five people in so far,

00:11:57.672 --> 00:12:00.728
and indeed, we found exactly
the same thing.

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.093
They're not lying.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:08.100
The brain areas associated
with intense romantic love

00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:12.125
still become active, 25 years later.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.306
There are still many questions
to be answered

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.076
and asked about romantic love.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.615
The question that I'm working on
right this minute --

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.380
and I'm only going to say it
for a second, and then end --

00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:26.479
is, why do you fall in love
with one person, rather than another?

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:29.306
I never would have
even thought to think of this,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.306
but Match.com, the Internet dating site,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.125
came to me three years ago
and asked me that question.

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:35.474
And I said, I don't know.

00:12:35.498 --> 00:12:38.875
I know what happens in the brain,
when you do become in love,

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:42.416
but I don't know why you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.202
And so, I've spent
the last three years on this.

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:48.238
And there are many reasons
that you fall in love with one person

00:12:48.262 --> 00:12:50.753
rather than another,
that psychologists can tell you.

00:12:50.777 --> 00:12:54.610
And we tend to fall in love with somebody
from the same socioeconomic background,

00:12:54.634 --> 00:12:58.468
the same general level of intelligence,
of good looks, the same religious values.

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:01.306
Your childhood certainly plays a role,
but nobody knows how.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.491
And that's about it, that's all they know.

00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:05.125
No, they've never found

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:09.508
the way two personalities
fit together to make a good relationship.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:11.306
So, it began to occur to me

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.029
that maybe your biology pulls you
towards some people rather than another.

00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:20.938
And I have concocted a questionnaire
to see to what degree

00:13:20.962 --> 00:13:25.306
you express dopamine, serotonin,
estrogen and testosterone.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.601
I think we've evolved four
very broad personality types

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:32.306
associated with the ratios
of these four chemicals in the brain.

00:13:32.748 --> 00:13:36.949
And on this dating site
that I have created, called Chemistry.com,

00:13:36.973 --> 00:13:40.582
I ask you first a series of questions

00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:43.739
to see to what degree
you express these chemicals,

00:13:43.763 --> 00:13:46.799
and I'm watching who chooses who to love.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.738
And 3.7 million people have taken
the questionnaire in America.

00:13:51.762 --> 00:13:56.124
About 600,000 people have taken it
in 33 other countries.

00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:57.828
I'm putting the data together now,

00:13:57.852 --> 00:14:01.172
and at some point --
there will always be magic to love,

00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:04.611
but I think I will come closer
to understanding

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:08.912
why it is you can walk into a room
and everybody is from your background,

00:14:08.936 --> 00:14:12.464
your same general level
of intelligence, good looks,

00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:14.676
and you don't feel
pulled towards all of them.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.579
I think there's biology to that.

00:14:16.603 --> 00:14:19.164
I think we're going to end up,
in the next few years,

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:21.378
to understand all kinds
of brain mechanisms

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.712
that pull us to one person
rather than another.

00:14:24.736 --> 00:14:26.839
So, I will close with this.

00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:29.710
These are my older people.

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:35.737
Faulkner said, "The past is not dead,
it's not even past."

00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:40.198
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage
from our yesteryear in the human brain.

00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:47.492
And so, there's one thing that makes me
pursue my understanding of human nature,

00:14:48.107 --> 00:14:50.108
and this reminds me of it.

00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:51.556
These are two women.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.712
Women tend to get intimacy
differently than men do.

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:56.996
Women get intimacy
from face-to-face talking.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.917
We swivel towards each other,

00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.043
we do what we call
the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:04.630
This is intimacy to women.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.539
I think it comes from millions of years

00:15:06.563 --> 00:15:08.645
of holding that baby
in front of your face,

00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:12.079
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

00:15:12.103 --> 00:15:15.696
Men tend to get intimacy
from side-by-side doing.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.090
As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away.

00:15:19.114 --> 00:15:20.813
(Laughter)

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:25.934
I think it comes from millions of years
sitting behind the bush,

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.996
looking straight ahead, trying to hit
that buffalo on the head with a rock.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:33.196
I think, for millions of years,
men faced their enemies,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.948
they sat side-by-side with friends.

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:40.224
So my final statement is: love is in us.

00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:42.816
It's deeply embedded in the brain.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.645
Our challenge is to understand each other.

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:46.870
Thank you.

00:15:46.894 --> 00:15:51.314
(Applause)
