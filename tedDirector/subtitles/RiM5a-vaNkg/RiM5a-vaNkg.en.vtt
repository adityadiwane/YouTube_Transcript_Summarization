00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:15.507
As a student of adversity,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.617
I've been struck over the years
by how some people with major challenges

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.979
seem to draw strength from them.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.586
And I've heard the popular wisdom
that that has to do with finding meaning.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.401
And for a long time,

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.800
I thought the meaning was out there,

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.303
some great truth waiting to be found.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:37.535
But over time,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.103
I've come to feel
that the truth is irrelevant.

00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:42.776
We call it "finding meaning,"

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.102
but we might better call
it "forging meaning."

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:49.928
My last book was about
how families manage to deal

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:53.663
with various kinds of challenging
or unusual offspring.

00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:56.470
And one of the mothers I interviewed,

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:59.457
who had two children
with multiple severe disabilities,

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:04.178
said to me, "People always give us
these little sayings like,

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:07.118
'God doesn't give you
any more than you can handle.'

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.216
But children like ours
are not preordained as a gift.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:14.296
They're a gift

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.045
because that's what we have chosen."

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.280
We make those choices all our lives.

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.395
When I was in second grade,

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.276
Bobby Finkel had a birthday party

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.573
and invited everyone in our class but me.

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:35.131
My mother assumed
there had been some sort of error,

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:36.793
and she called Mrs. Finkel,

00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:41.428
who said that Bobby didn't like me
and didn't want me at his party.

00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:45.219
And that day, my mom took me to the zoo

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:47.150
and out for a hot fudge sundae.

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:49.951
When I was in seventh grade,

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:54.293
one of the kids on my school bus
nicknamed me "Percy,"

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.638
as a shorthand for my demeanor.

00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:02.059
And sometimes, he and his cohort
would chant that provocation

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:04.113
the entire school bus ride,

00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:07.750
45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:11.739
"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:16.753
When I was in eighth grade,
our science teacher told us

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:20.801
that all male homosexuals
develop fecal incontinence

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.937
because of the trauma
to their anal sphincter.

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:29.838
And I graduated high school
without ever going to the cafeteria,

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.839
where I would have sat with the girls
and been laughed at for doing so,

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.520
or sat with the boys,

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.454
and been laughed at for being a boy
who should be sitting with the girls.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:45.073
I survived that childhood
through a mix of avoidance and endurance.

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.555
What I didn't know then

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.055
and do know now,

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.556
is that avoidance and endurance
can be the entryway to forging meaning.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.509
After you've forged meaning,

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:02.193
you need to incorporate that meaning
into a new identity.

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.777
You need to take the traumas

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.076
and make them part
of who you've come to be,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.088
and you need to fold
the worst events of your life

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:13.213
into a narrative of triumph,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.755
evincing a better self
in response to things that hurt.

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:22.795
One of the other mothers I interviewed
when I was working on my book

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.144
had been raped as an adolescent,

00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:28.080
and had a child following that rape,

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:31.063
which had thrown away her career plans

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:34.327
and damaged all
of her emotional relationships.

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.036
But when I met her, she was 50,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.438
and I said to her,

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:42.208
"Do you often think
about the man who raped you?"

00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:46.196
And she said, "I used to think
about him with anger,

00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:48.593
but now only with pity."

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:52.020
And I thought she meant pity
because he was so unevolved

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:54.120
as to have done this terrible thing.

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:55.866
And I said, "Pity?"

00:03:56.343 --> 00:03:57.927
And she said, "Yes,

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:03.068
because he has a beautiful daughter
and two beautiful grandchildren,

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:04.566
and he doesn't know that,

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:06.281
and I do.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.120
So as it turns out,

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.140
I'm the lucky one."

00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:15.166
Some of our struggles
are things we're born to:

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:20.841
our gender, our sexuality,
our race, our disability.

00:04:21.507 --> 00:04:23.761
And some are things that happen to us:

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:27.359
being a political prisoner,
being a rape victim,

00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:29.062
being a Katrina survivor.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.789
Identity involves entering a community

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:34.952
to draw strength from that community,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.303
and to give strength there, too.

00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:41.691
It involves substituting
"and" for "but" --

00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:45.771
not "I am here but I have cancer,"

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:51.040
but rather, "I have cancer and I am here."

00:04:51.952 --> 00:04:54.956
When we're ashamed,
we can't tell our stories,

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:58.078
and stories are the foundation

00:04:58.102 --> 00:04:59.325
of identity.

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.187
Forge meaning,

00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:03.610
build identity.

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.443
Forge meaning and build identity.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.681
That became my mantra.

00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:13.182
Forging meaning
is about changing yourself.

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:16.960
Building identity
is about changing the world.

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:21.620
All of us with stigmatized identities
face this question daily:

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:26.635
How much to accommodate society
by constraining ourselves,

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.075
and how much to break the limits

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.490
of what constitutes a valid life?

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.490
Forging meaning and building identity

00:05:35.514 --> 00:05:37.804
does not make what was wrong right.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.396
It only makes what was wrong precious.

00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:45.197
In January of this year,

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.283
I went to Myanmar
to interview political prisoners,

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:53.474
and I was surprised to find them
less bitter than I'd anticipated.

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:56.403
Most of them had knowingly
committed the offenses

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.244
that landed them in prison,

00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:01.723
and they had walked in
with their heads held high,

00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:05.788
and they walked out
with their heads still held high,

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:07.350
many years later.

00:06:07.897 --> 00:06:11.309
Dr. Ma Thida, a leading
human rights activist

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.737
who had nearly died in prison

00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:15.791
and had spent many years
in solitary confinement,

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:21.771
told me she was grateful to her jailers
for the time she had had to think,

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:23.897
for the wisdom she had gained,

00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:27.080
for the chance to hone
her meditation skills.

00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.405
She had sought meaning

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:32.649
and made her travail
into a crucial identity.

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:37.299
But if the people I met
were less bitter than I'd anticipated

00:06:37.323 --> 00:06:38.860
about being in prison,

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:41.725
they were also less thrilled
than I'd expected

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:44.813
about the reform process
going on in their country.

00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:46.932
Ma Thida said,

00:06:46.956 --> 00:06:51.912
"We Burmese are noted
for our tremendous grace under pressure,

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:55.849
but we also have grievance under glamour."

00:06:56.587 --> 00:07:00.304
She said, "And the fact that there
have been these shifts and changes

00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:04.165
doesn't erase the continuing
problems in our society

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.960
that we learned to see so well
while we were in prison."

00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:10.521
I understood her to be saying

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:14.072
that concessions confer
only a little humanity

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.884
where full humanity is due;

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:20.013
that crumbs are not the same
as a place at the table.

00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:21.918
Which is to say,

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:25.072
you can forge meaning and build identity

00:07:25.096 --> 00:07:27.416
and still be mad as hell.

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.180
I've never been raped,

00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:35.670
and I've never been in anything
remotely approaching a Burmese prison.

00:07:36.214 --> 00:07:38.047
But as a gay American,

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:41.609
I've experienced prejudice
and even hatred,

00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:43.864
and I've forged meaning

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.624
and I've built identity,

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:48.972
which is a move I learned from people

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:52.934
who had experienced far worse privation
than I've ever known.

00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:55.907
In my own adolescence,

00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.581
I went to extreme lengths
to try to be straight.

00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:03.458
I enrolled myself in something called
"sexual surrogacy therapy,"

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:07.144
in which people
I was encouraged to call doctors

00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:11.096
prescribed what I was encouraged
to call exercises

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.130
with women I was encouraged
to call surrogates,

00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:17.226
who were not exactly prostitutes

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.151
but who were also
not exactly anything else.

00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:23.470
(Laughter)

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:28.656
My particular favorite
was a blonde woman from the Deep South

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.707
who eventually admitted to me
that she was really a necrophiliac,

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.510
and had taken this job
after she got in trouble

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:36.983
down at the morgue.

00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:40.854
(Laughter)

00:08:43.704 --> 00:08:46.683
These experiences eventually
allowed me to have

00:08:46.707 --> 00:08:49.524
some happy physical
relationships with women,

00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:50.754
for which I'm grateful.

00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:53.063
But I was at war with myself,

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:57.187
and I dug terrible wounds
into my own psyche.

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:01.739
We don't seek the painful experiences

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:03.504
that hew our identities,

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:06.146
but we seek our identities

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.102
in the wake of painful experiences.

00:09:09.643 --> 00:09:12.412
We cannot bear a pointless torment,

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:15.005
but we can endure great pain

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:17.076
if we believe that it's purposeful.

00:09:17.972 --> 00:09:20.436
Ease makes less of an impression on us

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.832
than struggle.

00:09:21.856 --> 00:09:24.578
We could have been ourselves
without our delights,

00:09:24.688 --> 00:09:28.843
but not without the misfortunes
that drive our search for meaning.

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:33.167
"Therefore, I take
pleasure in infirmities,"

00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:35.832
St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,

00:09:35.856 --> 00:09:39.106
"for when I am weak, then I am strong."

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.355
In 1988, I went to Moscow
to interview artists

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:46.023
of the Soviet underground.

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:49.683
I expected their work
to be dissident and political.

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:52.474
But the radicalism in their work

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:56.334
actually lay in reinserting
humanity into a society

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:58.948
that was annihilating humanity itself,

00:09:58.972 --> 00:10:02.667
as, in some senses,
Russian society is now doing again.

00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:05.798
One of the artists I met said to me,

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:09.398
"We were in training to be
not artists but angels."

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:14.740
In 1991, I went back to see
the artists I'd been writing about,

00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:18.652
and I was with them during the putsch
that ended the Soviet Union.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.353
And they were among the chief organizers
of the resistance to that putsch.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.376
And on the third day of the putsch,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.237
one of them suggested
we walk up to Smolenskaya.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:32.021
And we went there,

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:35.241
and we arranged ourselves
in front of one of the barricades,

00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:36.712
and a little while later,

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.411
a column of tanks rolled up.

00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:41.186
And the soldier on the front tank said,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.024
"We have unconditional orders
to destroy this barricade.

00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:48.015
If you get out of the way,
we don't need to hurt you.

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:51.431
But if you won't move, we'll have
no choice but to run you down."

00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:54.877
The artist I was with said,
"Give us just a minute.

00:10:55.326 --> 00:10:58.750
Give us just a minute
to tell you why we're here."

00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:01.471
And the soldier folded his arms,

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:06.070
and the artist launched into
a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy

00:11:06.094 --> 00:11:09.849
such as those of us who live
in a Jeffersonian democracy

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:12.346
would be hard-pressed to present.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.820
And they went on and on,

00:11:14.844 --> 00:11:16.254
and the soldier watched.

00:11:16.808 --> 00:11:20.072
And then he sat there for a full minute
after they were finished

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.694
and looked at us,
so bedraggled in the rain,

00:11:22.718 --> 00:11:26.820
and said, "What you have said is true,

00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:29.519
and we must bow to the will of the people.

00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:32.847
If you'll clear enough space
for us to turn around,

00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:34.725
we'll go back the way we came."

00:11:35.272 --> 00:11:36.630
And that's what they did.

00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:42.076
Sometimes, forging meaning
can give you the vocabulary you need

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.036
to fight for your ultimate freedom.

00:11:45.254 --> 00:11:48.090
Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion

00:11:48.114 --> 00:11:50.644
that oppression breeds
the power to oppose it.

00:11:50.995 --> 00:11:55.695
And I gradually understood that
as the cornerstone of identity.

00:11:56.496 --> 00:12:00.044
It took identity
to rescue me from sadness.

00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:02.851
The gay rights movement posits a world

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:05.248
in which my aberrances are a victory.

00:12:05.915 --> 00:12:08.818
Identity politics
always works on two fronts:

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:13.933
to give pride to people who have
a given condition or characteristic,

00:12:13.957 --> 00:12:16.792
and to cause the outside world
to treat such people

00:12:16.816 --> 00:12:18.598
more gently and more kindly.

00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:22.458
Those are two totally
separate enterprises,

00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:25.878
but progress in each sphere
reverberates in the other.

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:29.640
Identity politics can be narcissistic.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.335
People extol a difference
only because it's theirs.

00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:37.144
People narrow the world
and function in discrete groups

00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:38.927
without empathy for one another.

00:12:39.546 --> 00:12:43.493
But properly understood
and wisely practiced,

00:12:43.517 --> 00:12:47.725
identity politics should expand
our idea of what it is to be human.

00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:54.001
Identity itself should be
not a smug label or a gold medal,

00:12:54.617 --> 00:12:55.970
but a revolution.

00:12:56.848 --> 00:12:59.809
I would have had an easier life
if I were straight,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.697
but I would not be me.

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:04.859
And I now like being myself better

00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:06.993
than the idea of being someone else,

00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:08.642
someone who, to be honest,

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:12.560
I have neither the option of being
nor the ability fully to imagine.

00:13:13.257 --> 00:13:17.285
But if you banish the dragons,
you banish the heroes,

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:21.658
and we become attached
to the heroic strain in our own lives.

00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:23.805
I've sometimes wondered

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:26.588
whether I could have ceased
to hate that part of myself

00:13:26.612 --> 00:13:29.445
without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,

00:13:29.469 --> 00:13:32.115
of which this speech is one manifestation.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:33.732
(Laughter)

00:13:33.756 --> 00:13:36.689
I used to think I would know
myself to be mature

00:13:36.713 --> 00:13:39.143
when I could simply be gay
without emphasis.

00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:43.636
But the self-loathing
of that period left a void,

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.914
and celebration needs
to fill and overflow it,

00:13:46.938 --> 00:13:50.774
and even if I repay
my private debt of melancholy,

00:13:50.798 --> 00:13:53.689
there's still an outer world of homophobia

00:13:53.713 --> 00:13:55.813
that it will take decades to address.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.798
Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:02.123
free of party hats and blame.

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:03.828
But not yet.

00:14:04.602 --> 00:14:08.775
A friend of mine who thought gay pride
was getting very carried away with itself,

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:12.053
once suggested that we organize
Gay Humility Week.

00:14:12.077 --> 00:14:13.465
(Laughter)

00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:17.586
(Applause)

00:14:18.752 --> 00:14:19.943
It's a great idea.

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:21.331
(Laughter)

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:23.182
But its time has not yet come.

00:14:23.206 --> 00:14:25.167
(Laughter)

00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:30.569
And neutrality, which seems to lie
halfway between despair and celebration,

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:32.285
is actually the endgame.

00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:35.831
In 29 states in the US,

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:39.356
I could legally be fired or denied housing

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.705
for being gay.

00:14:41.352 --> 00:14:44.095
In Russia, the anti-propaganda law

00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:46.735
has led to people being beaten
in the streets.

00:14:47.316 --> 00:14:52.167
Twenty-seven African countries
have passed laws against sodomy.

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:55.927
And in Nigeria, gay people
can legally be stoned to death,

00:14:55.951 --> 00:14:57.894
and lynchings have become common.

00:14:58.578 --> 00:15:00.652
In Saudi Arabia recently,

00:15:00.676 --> 00:15:03.549
two men who had been caught in carnal acts

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:08.089
were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,

00:15:08.113 --> 00:15:10.672
and are now permanently
disabled as a result.

00:15:11.337 --> 00:15:13.560
So who can forge meaning

00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:15.094
and build identity?

00:15:16.118 --> 00:15:19.593
Gay rights are not primarily
marriage rights,

00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:22.688
and for the millions who live
in unaccepting places

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:24.557
with no resources,

00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:26.399
dignity remains elusive.

00:15:27.106 --> 00:15:29.686
I am lucky to have forged meaning

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:31.741
and built identity,

00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:34.321
but that's still a rare privilege.

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.524
And gay people deserve more, collectively,

00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:39.876
than the crumbs of justice.

00:15:40.714 --> 00:15:42.117
And yet,

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.933
every step forward is so sweet.

00:15:45.815 --> 00:15:49.684
In 2007, six years after we met,

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:52.536
my partner and I decided to get married.

00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:57.315
Meeting John had been the discovery
of great happiness

00:15:57.339 --> 00:16:00.207
and also the elimination
of great unhappiness.

00:16:00.707 --> 00:16:05.772
And sometimes, I was so occupied
with the disappearance of all that pain,

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:07.561
that I forgot about the joy,

00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:10.945
which was at first
the less remarkable part of it to me.

00:16:11.764 --> 00:16:14.371
Marrying was a way to declare our love

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:17.322
as more a presence than an absence.

00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:20.410
Marriage soon led us to children,

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:22.381
and that meant new meanings

00:16:22.775 --> 00:16:25.706
and new identities -- ours and theirs.

00:16:26.849 --> 00:16:29.018
I want my children to be happy,

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.713
and I love them most achingly
when they are sad.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.188
As a gay father, I can teach them
to own what is wrong in their lives,

00:16:38.827 --> 00:16:42.916
but I believe that if I succeed
in sheltering them from adversity,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.896
I will have failed as a parent.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.789
A Buddhist scholar I know
once explained to me

00:16:48.813 --> 00:16:50.983
that Westerners mistakenly think

00:16:51.007 --> 00:16:55.389
that nirvana is what arrives
when all your woe is behind you,

00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:58.458
and you have only bliss
to look forward to.

00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:01.163
But he said that would not be nirvana,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.188
because your bliss in the present

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:06.097
would always be shadowed
by the joy from the past.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.407
Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at

00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:12.027
when you have only bliss
to look forward to

00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:16.722
and find in what looked like sorrows
the seedlings of your joy.

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:19.178
And I sometimes wonder

00:17:19.202 --> 00:17:22.899
whether I could have found
such fulfillment in marriage and children

00:17:22.923 --> 00:17:24.488
if they'd come more readily,

00:17:25.115 --> 00:17:29.046
if I'd been straight in my youth
or were young now,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.538
in either of which cases
this might be easier.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.047
Perhaps I could.

00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:36.278
Perhaps all the complex
imagining I've done

00:17:36.302 --> 00:17:38.577
could have been applied to other topics.

00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.254
But if seeking meaning
matters more than finding meaning,

00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:46.851
the question is not whether
I'd be happier for having been bullied,

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:50.260
but whether assigning meaning
to those experiences

00:17:50.284 --> 00:17:51.981
has made me a better father.

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:56.714
I tend to find the ecstasy
hidden in ordinary joys,

00:17:56.738 --> 00:18:00.300
because I did not expect those joys
to be ordinary to me.

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:05.324
I know many heterosexuals who have
equally happy marriages and families,

00:18:05.348 --> 00:18:08.292
but gay marriage
is so breathtakingly fresh,

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:11.633
and gay families so exhilaratingly new,

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.754
and I found meaning in that surprise.

00:18:15.772 --> 00:18:19.262
In October, it was my 50th birthday,

00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:21.828
and my family organized a party for me.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.205
And in the middle of it,
my son said to my husband

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:26.976
that he wanted to make a speech.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.158
And John said,

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:32.241
"George, you can't make
a speech. You're four."

00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:33.946
(Laughter)

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.491
"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I
are going to make speeches tonight."

00:18:38.515 --> 00:18:41.110
But George insisted and insisted,

00:18:41.134 --> 00:18:44.582
and finally, John took him
up to the microphone,

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:47.455
and George said very loudly,

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.899
"Ladies and gentlemen!

00:18:49.923 --> 00:18:52.395
May I have your attention, please?"

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:54.514
And everyone turned around, startled.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.446
And George said,

00:18:57.327 --> 00:18:59.207
"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.

00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:01.713
I'm glad we all get cake.

00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:05.729
And Daddy, if you were little,

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.692
I'd be your friend."

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:09.084
(Gasp)

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.494
And I thought -- (Applause)

00:19:11.988 --> 00:19:13.139
Thank you.

00:19:13.163 --> 00:19:16.851
I thought that I was indebted
even to Bobby Finkel,

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:19.517
because all those earlier experiences

00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:21.956
were what had propelled me to this moment,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.489
and I was finally unconditionally grateful

00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:27.667
for a life I'd once have done
anything to change.

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:32.956
The gay activist Harvey Milk
was once asked by a younger gay man

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.060
what he could do to help the movement,

00:19:35.084 --> 00:19:36.678
and Harvey Milk said,

00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:38.289
"Go out and tell someone."

00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:42.637
There's always somebody
who wants to confiscate our humanity.

00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:45.266
And there are always
stories that restore it.

00:19:45.816 --> 00:19:47.371
If we live out loud,

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.392
we can trounce the hatred,

00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:51.622
and expand everyone's lives.

00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:53.785
Forge meaning.

00:19:54.222 --> 00:19:55.580
Build identity.

00:19:56.169 --> 00:19:57.731
Forge meaning.

00:19:58.393 --> 00:20:00.379
Build identity.

00:20:01.228 --> 00:20:04.135
And then invite the world
to share your joy.

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:05.874
Thank you.

00:20:05.898 --> 00:20:08.916
(Applause)

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.158
Thank you.

00:20:10.182 --> 00:20:12.200
(Applause)

00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:13.403
Thank you.

00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:16.125
(Applause)

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:17.302
Thank you.

00:20:17.326 --> 00:20:22.357
(Applause)
