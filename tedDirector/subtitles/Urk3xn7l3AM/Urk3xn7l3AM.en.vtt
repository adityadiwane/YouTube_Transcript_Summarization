00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:17.785
Someday, we may have robots
as smart as people,

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.283
artificial intelligence, AI.

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:21.783
How could that happen?

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:25.816
One route is that we'll just keep
accumulating better software,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.832
like we've been doing for 70 years.

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:31.299
At past rates of progress,
that may take centuries.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.308
Some say it'll happen a lot faster

00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:37.823
as we discover grand new
powerful theories of intelligence.

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:39.426
I'm skeptical.

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:43.489
But a third scenario

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.340
is what I'm going to talk about today.

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.102
The idea is to port the software
from the human brain.

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:52.093
To do this, we're going to need
three technologies to be good enough,

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:53.672
and none of them are there yet.

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:58.951
First, we're going to need
lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:04.882
Second, we're going to need
to scan individual human brains

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:07.144
in fine spatial and chemical detail,

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:11.196
to see exactly what cells are where,
connected to what, of what type.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.576
And third, we're going to need
computer models

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.822
of how each kind of brain cell works --

00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:21.402
taking input signals,
changing interval state

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:22.720
and sending output signals.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:26.562
If we have good enough models
of all the kinds of brain cells

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.349
and a good enough model of the brain,

00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:31.807
we can put it together to make
a good enough model of an entire brain,

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:35.834
and that model would have the same
input-output behavior as the original.

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:38.343
So if you talk to it, it might talk back.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.464
If you ask it to do things,
it might do them.

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:43.310
And if we could do that,
everything would change.

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.902
People have been talking
about this idea for decades,

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:47.715
under the name of "uploads."

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.223
I'm going to call them "ems."

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.779
When they talk about it, they say,

00:01:52.803 --> 00:01:54.347
"Is this even possible?

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:58.009
If you made one, would it be conscious?
Or is it just an empty machine?

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:00.485
If you made one of me,
is that me or someone else?"

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:03.958
These are all fascinating questions
that I'm going to ignore ...

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:06.347
(Laughter)

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:08.950
because I see a neglected question:

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.584
What would actually happen?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.164
I became obsessed with this question.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.766
I spent four years trying to analyze it,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.337
using standard academic tools,
to guess what would happen,

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.210
and I'm here to tell you what I found.

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:26.130
But be warned --

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.949
I'm not offering inspiration,
I'm offering analysis.

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:32.767
I see my job as telling you
what's most likely to happen

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.568
if we did the least to avoid it.

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:39.254
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed
by something I tell you here,

00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:40.872
you're just not paying attention.

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:42.247
(Laughter)

00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.867
OK, the first thing I can tell you

00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:48.024
is that ems spend most
of their life in virtual reality.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.123
This is what you might look like
if you were using virtual reality.

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:56.044
And this is what you might see:

00:02:57.064 --> 00:03:00.660
sunlight glinting off of water,
you might hear gulls flying above,

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:03.715
you might even feel the wind
on your cheeks or smell seawater,

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.064
with advanced hardware.

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:07.999
Now, if you were to spend
a lot of time here,

00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:09.289
you might want a dashboard

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:11.807
where you could do things like
make a phone call,

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.381
move to a new virtual world,

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:14.705
check your bank account.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.437
Now, while this is what
you would look like in virtual reality,

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.589
this is what an em
would look like in virtual reality.

00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:25.369
It's computer hardware
sitting in a server rack somewhere.

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:28.551
But still, it could see
and experience the same thing.

00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:30.932
But some things are different for ems.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.296
First, while you'll probably always notice
that virtual reality isn't entirely real,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.574
to an em, it can feel as real to them
as this room feels to you now

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:41.236
or as anything ever feels.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.672
And ems also have
some more action possibilities.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.925
For example, your mind just always
runs at the same speed,

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.790
but an em can add more or less
computer hardware to run faster or slower,

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:54.502
and therefore, if the world around them
seems to be going too fast,

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.145
they can just speed up their mind,

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.519
and the world around them
would seem to slow down.

00:03:58.543 --> 00:04:03.384
In addition, an em can make
a copy of itself at that moment.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.037
This copy would remember
everything the same,

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:09.377
and if it starts out with the same speed,
looking at the same speed,

00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:12.052
it might even need to be told,
"You are the copy."

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.172
And em could make archive copies,

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.020
and with enough archives,

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:18.116
an em can be immortal --

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.330
in principle, though not
usually in practice.

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.763
And an em can move its brain,
the computer that represents its brain,

00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:26.874
from one physical location to another.

00:04:27.857 --> 00:04:31.175
Ems can actually move around the world
at the speed of light,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.731
and by moving to a new location,

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.019
they can interact more quickly
with ems near that new location.

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:40.320
So far, I've been talking about
what ems can do.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.947
What do ems choose to do?

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:47.202
To understand that, we'll need
to understand three key facts.

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:54.067
First, ems by definition do what
the human they emulate would do

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.392
in the same situation.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.768
So their lives and behavior
are very human.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:02.089
They're mainly different because
they're living in a different world.

00:05:02.113 --> 00:05:05.411
Second, ems need
real resources to survive.

00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:09.098
You need food and shelter or you'll die.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:13.432
Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can't exist.

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:16.031
For every subjective minute
that an em experiences,

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:19.329
someone, usually that em,
had to work to pay for it.

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:21.646
Third, ems are poor.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.820
(Laughter)

00:05:23.535 --> 00:05:26.170
The em population can grow
quicker than the em economy,

00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:29.529
so that means wages fall down
to em subsistence levels.

00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:32.157
That means ems have to be working
most of the time.

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:35.109
So that means
this is what ems usually see:

00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:38.052
beautiful and luxurious, but desks --

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.800
they're working most of the time.

00:05:40.103 --> 00:05:44.072
Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
you might think, is exotic and strange,

00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.437
but it's actually the usual case
in human history,

00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:49.175
and it's how pretty much
all wild animals have ever lived,

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.475
so we know what humans do
in this situation.

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.429
Humans basically do
what it takes to survive,

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:57.762
and this is what lets me say
so much about the em world.

00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:00.961
When creatures are rich, like you,

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.008
you have to know a lot
about what they want

00:06:03.032 --> 00:06:04.373
to figure out what they do.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.567
When creatures are poor,

00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:08.248
you know that they mostly do
what it takes to survive.

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:12.220
So we've been talking about the em world
from the point of view of the ems --

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:14.759
now, let's step back
and look at their whole world.

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:17.863
First, the em world grows
much faster than ours,

00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:20.351
roughly a hundred times faster.

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:23.538
So the amount of change
we would experience in a century or two,

00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:25.420
they would experience in a year or two.

00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:28.482
And I'm not really willing to project
this age much beyond that,

00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:31.943
because plausibly by then something else
will happen, I don't know what.

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.325
Second, the typical emulation
runs even faster,

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.538
roughly a thousand times human speed.

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:42.476
So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.692
and for them, the world around them
is actually changing more slowly

00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:47.658
than your world seems to change for you.

00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:52.581
Third, ems are crammed together
in a small number of very dense cities.

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:56.071
This is not only how they see
themselves in virtual reality,

00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:58.991
it's also how they actually are
physically crammed together.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:03.180
So at em speeds, physical travel
feels really painfully slow,

00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:05.526
so most em cities are self-sufficient,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.300
most war is cyber war,

00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:10.015
and most of the rest of the earth
away from the em cities

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.713
is left to the humans, because the ems
really aren't that interested in it.

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:15.580
Speaking of humans,

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:17.388
you were wanting to hear about that.

00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:21.878
Humans must retire, at once, for good.

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:24.230
They just can't compete.

00:07:24.738 --> 00:07:27.810
Now, humans start out owning
all of the capital in this world.

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.703
The economy grows very fast,
their wealth grows very fast.

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:33.111
Humans get rich, collectively.

00:07:34.048 --> 00:07:37.287
As you may know, most humans today
don't actually own that much

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.152
besides their ability to work,

00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:42.724
so between now and then,
they need to acquire sufficient assets,

00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:44.581
insurance or sharing arrangements,

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:46.066
or they may starve.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.105
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.414
(Laughter)

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:51.508
Now, you might wonder,

00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:53.010
why would ems let humans exist?

00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:54.749
Why not kill them, take their stuff?

00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:58.598
But notice we have many
unproductive retirees around us today,

00:07:58.622 --> 00:08:00.727
and we don't kill them
and take their stuff.

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:02.385
(Laughter)

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:06.829
In part, that's because it would disrupt
the institutions we share with them.

00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:09.460
Other groups would wonder who's next,

00:08:09.484 --> 00:08:14.210
so plausibly, ems may well let humans
retire in peace during the age of em.

00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:17.283
You should worry more that
the age of em only lasts a year or two

00:08:17.307 --> 00:08:19.135
and you don't know what happens next.

00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:23.393
Ems are very much like humans,

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.726
but they are not like the typical human.

00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:32.241
The typical em is a copy
of the few hundred most productive humans.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:36.729
So in fact, they are as elite,
compared to the typical human,

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:39.015
as the typical billionaire,
Nobel Prize winner,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.388
Olympic gold medalist, head of state.

00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:46.649
Ems look on humans
perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,

00:08:46.673 --> 00:08:48.181
but not so much respect,

00:08:48.205 --> 00:08:51.400
which is, if you think about it,
how you think about your ancestors.

00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:54.691
We know many things about how humans
differ in terms of productivity.

00:08:54.715 --> 00:08:57.134
We can just use those
to predict features of ems --

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:00.254
for example, they tend to be smart,
conscientious, hard-working,

00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:01.963
married, religious, middle-aged.

00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:03.893
These are features of ems.

00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:06.145
Em world also contains enormous variety.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.198
Not only does it continue on with most
of the kinds of variety that humans do,

00:09:10.222 --> 00:09:12.617
including variety of industry
and profession,

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:14.803
they also have many new kinds of variety,

00:09:14.827 --> 00:09:17.172
and one of the most important
is mind speed.

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:21.366
Ems can plausibly go from human speed

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.270
up to a million times
faster than human speed,

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:27.071
and down to a billion times
slower than human speed.

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:30.812
Faster ems tend to have
markers of high status.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.996
They embody more wealth.
They win arguments.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.683
They sit at premium locations.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.527
Slower ems are mostly retirees,

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:38.801
and they are like the ghosts
of our literature.

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.866
If you recall, ghosts are all around us --

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.160
you can interact with them
if you pay the price.

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:45.613
But they don't know much,
they can't influence much,

00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:48.335
and they're obsessed with the past,
so what's the point?

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:49.510
(Laughter)

00:09:49.534 --> 00:09:52.491
Ems also have more variety
in the structure of their lives.

00:09:52.515 --> 00:09:55.197
This is your life: you start
and you end, really simple.

00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:56.834
This is the life of an em,

00:09:56.858 --> 00:09:59.151
who every day splits off
some short-term copies

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:01.133
to do short-term tasks and then end.

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:05.284
We'll talk more about
those short term versions in a moment,

00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:06.918
but they are much more efficient

00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:09.307
because they don't have to rest
for the next day.

00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:10.839
This em is more opportunistic.

00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:14.150
They make more copies of themselves
when there's more demand for that.

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:16.271
They don't know which way
the future's going.

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:17.594
This is an em designer,

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.220
who conceives of a large system

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:22.729
and then breaks recursively into copies
who elaborate that,

00:10:22.753 --> 00:10:26.165
so ems can implement
larger, more coherent designs.

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:27.547
This an emulation plumber

00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:30.016
who remembers that every day,
for the last 20 years,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.821
they only ever worked
two hours a day, a life of leisure.

00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:35.942
But what really happened is,
every day they had a thousand copies,

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:37.919
each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,

00:10:37.943 --> 00:10:40.108
and only one of them
went on to the next day.

00:10:40.132 --> 00:10:43.131
Objectively, they're working
well over 99 percent of the time.

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:45.345
Subjectively, they remember
a life of leisure.

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:46.377
(Laughter)

00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.489
This, again, is you.
You start and you end.

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:50.625
This could be you
if at the start of party,

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.460
you took a drug that meant
you would not remember that party

00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:55.102
ever after that day.

00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:57.055
Some people do this, I'm told.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.125
Toward the end of the party,

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:02.075
will you say to yourself,
"I'm about to die, this is terrible.

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:05.402
That person tomorrow isn't me,
because they won't remember what I do."

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:09.387
Or you could say, "I will go on tomorrow.
I just won't remember what I did."

00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:11.840
This is an em who splits off
a short-term copy

00:11:11.864 --> 00:11:13.728
to do a short-term task and then end.

00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:15.958
They have the same two
attitude possibilities.

00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:19.661
They can say, "I'm a new short-term
creature with a short life. I hate this."

00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:22.819
Or "I'm a part of a larger creature
who won't remember this part."

00:11:22.843 --> 00:11:24.961
I predict they'll have
that second attitude,

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:28.661
not because it's philosophically correct,
but because it helps them get along.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:31.013
Today, if the president says
we must invade Iraq,

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.188
and you say, "Why?"

00:11:32.212 --> 00:11:33.594
and they say, "State secret,"

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:35.468
you're not sure if you can trust them,

00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:39.108
but for ems, a copy of the president
and a copy of you can go inside a safe,

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:40.786
explain all their secret reasons,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.341
and then one bit comes out
from your copy to yourself,

00:11:43.365 --> 00:11:45.221
telling you if you were convinced.

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.468
So now you can know
there is a good reason.

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:50.341
I know you guys are all eager
to evaluate this world.

00:11:50.365 --> 00:11:52.699
You're eager to decide
if you love it or hate it.

00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:55.266
But think: your ancestors
from thousands of years ago

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.043
would have loved or hated your world

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.488
based on the first few things
they heard about it,

00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:01.365
because your world
is really just weird.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.217
So before judging a strange future world,
you should really learn a lot about it,

00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:06.807
maybe read a whole book about it,

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.195
and then, if you don't like it,
work to change it.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.248
Thank you.

00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:15.105
(Applause)
