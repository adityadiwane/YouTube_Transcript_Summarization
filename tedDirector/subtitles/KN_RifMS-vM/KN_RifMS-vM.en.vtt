00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.113
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,

00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:17.102
and when I was 13, I convinced

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.832
one of the largest toy companies,

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:21.235
toymakers, in the world, Hasbro,

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.193
to change the way that they marketed

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.319
one of their most best-selling products.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.639
So allow me to tell you about it.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.456
So I have a brother, Gavin.

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:30.875
When this whole shebang happened, he was four.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.388
He loved to cook.

00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:34.606
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:36.746
and mixing them into these, needless to say,

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:38.135
uneatable concoctions,

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:41.176
or making invisible macaroni and cheese.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:44.325
He wanted to be a chef really badly.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:47.690
And so what better gift for a kid
who wanted to be a chef

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.930
than an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.773
I mean, we all had those when we were little.

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:53.913
And he wanted one so badly.

00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:56.532
But then he started to realize something.

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:00.093
In the commercials, and on the 
boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.324
Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:04.829
And the way that they did this

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.935
was they would only feature girls
on the boxes or in the commercials,

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:10.314
and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:13.267
and it would be in bright pink and purple,

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:16.608
very gender-specific colors to females, right?

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:19.193
So it kind of was sending a message

00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:22.158
that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:23.731
And this discouraged my brother a lot.

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.308
He thought that he wasn't
supposed to want to be a chef,

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:29.165
because that was something that girls did.

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.670
Girls cooked; boys didn't,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.160
or so was the message that Hasbro was sending.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.146
And this got me thinking,

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:37.387
God, I wish there was a way that I could change this,

00:01:37.387 --> 00:01:40.393
that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:42.170
so I could ask them and tell them

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.489
what they were doing wrong

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:44.882
and ask them to change it.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.700
And that got me thinking about a website

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.171
that I had learned about a few months prior

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:49.718
called Change.org.

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:53.051
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.498
where you can create a petition and share it

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.781
across all of these social media networks,

00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.223
through Facebook, through Twitter,

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:00.777
through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:02.646
through whatever you can think of.

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:04.428
And so I created a petition

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:07.642
along with the YouTube video
that I added to the petition

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:09.668
basically asking Hasbro

00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:11.915
to change the way that they marketed it,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.938
in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:16.898
and most of all creating them

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:19.622
in less gender-specific colors.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.020
So this petition started to take off --

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.387
humongously fast, you have no idea.

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:29.776
I was getting interviewed by
all these national news outlets

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:33.352
and press outlets, and it was amazing.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.968
In three weeks, maybe three and a half,

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:40.777
I had 46,000 signatures on this petition.

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.975
(Applause)

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.749
Thank you.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.126
So, needless to say, it was crazy.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:51.732
Eventually, Hasbro themselves
invited me to their headquarters

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:53.330
so they could go and unveil

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.778
their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.634
in black, silver and blue.

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:00.484
It was literally one of the best moments of my life.

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:02.527
It was like &amp;quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&amp;quot;

00:03:02.527 --> 00:03:04.413
That thing was amazing.

00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:06.083
What I didn't realize at the time, however,

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.010
was that I had become an activist,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.584
I could change something,

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:12.591
that even as a kid, or maybe 
even especially as a kid,

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.421
my voice mattered, and your voice matters too.

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:17.022
I want to let you know it's not going to be easy,

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:18.438
and it wasn't easy for me,

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:21.250
because I faced a lot of obstacles.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.981
People online, and sometimes even in real life,

00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:27.893
were disrespectful to me and my family,

00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:30.524
and talked about how the whole
thing was a waste of time,

00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:31.988
and it really discouraged me.

00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:35.182
And actually, I have some examples,
because what's better revenge

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.746
than displaying their idiocy?

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.535
So, let's see.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:42.259
From user name Liquidsore29 --

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.268
interesting user names we have hereâ€”

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:50.048
&amp;quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&amp;quot;

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.803
Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.

00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:56.643
How about from Whiteboy77AGS:

00:03:56.643 --> 00:04:00.792
"People always need something
to (female dog) about."

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.082
From Jeffrey Gutierrez:

00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:06.098
&amp;quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&amp;quot;

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.371
So it was comments like these

00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:11.171
that really discouraged me from
wanting to make change in the future

00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:13.628
because I thought, people don't care,

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.034
people think it's a waste of time,

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:19.893
and people are going to be disrespectful 
to me and my family.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.316
It hurt me, and it made me think,

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:24.798
what's the point of making change in the future?

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.455
But then I started to realize something.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:29.896
Haters gonna hate.

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:31.670
Come on, say it with me. One, two, three:

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.138
Haters gonna hate.

00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:36.020
So let your haters hate,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.704
you know what, and make your change,

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:39.545
because I know you can.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:40.967
I look out into this crowd,

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.233
and I see 400 people

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:46.478
who came out because they wanted to know
how they could make a change,

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.025
and I know that you can, and all
of you watching at home can too

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:52.697
because you have so much that you 
can do and that you believe in,

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:55.515
and you can trade it across all these social media,

00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:58.401
through Facebook, through Twitter, through 
YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:00.291
through whatever else you can think of.

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:01.747
And you can make that change.

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:03.168
You can take what you believe in

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.549
and turn it into a cause and change it.

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:08.617
And that spark that you've been 
hearing about all day today,

00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:11.253
you can use that spark that you have within you

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:12.773
and turn it into a fire.

00:05:12.773 --> 00:05:14.549
Thank you.

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:17.454
(Applause)
