00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.007
Good afternoon.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.950
I am not a farmer.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.885
(Laughter)

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:24.437
I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:25.999
And this is my world.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.612
And along the way I've started noticing --

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.081
I'm on my third generation of kids --

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.334
that they're getting bigger.

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:31.493
They're getting sicker.

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:33.477
In addition to these complexities,

00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:35.390
I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.400
who are labeled learning disabled would not have been

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.757
had they had proper prenatal nutrition.

00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:43.433
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.167
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.309
And as jobs continue to leave my community,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.252
and energy continues to come in, be exported in,

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:56.587
it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:59.187
But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,

00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.820
so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.156
that I'm hoping to share with you all today.

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:07.633
And with that note, I come to you with this belief

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.107
that kids should not have to leave their communities

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:11.488
to live, learn and earn in a better one.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.126
So I'm here to tell you a story about me

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.647
and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.390
And it starts with three people.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.468
The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left,

00:01:20.468 --> 00:01:23.846
I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit --

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:25.510
my passionate borough president

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.055
and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:29.319
who helped me with my class

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.806
and helped me get involved with this patented technology.

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.670
But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.326
in my place, which looks like this.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:42.979
And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.678
And that's really what this is all about.

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:46.414
And it starts with incredible kids like this,

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:48.135
who come early and stay late.

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:51.103
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,

00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:52.862
most come with a lot of handicaps,

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.415
most are homeless and many are in foster care.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.666
Almost all of my kids live below poverty.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.087
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.278
and this is what it looks like in my classroom.

00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:05.879
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.318
And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:14.535
But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.191
And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.319
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.687
into something small, like this,

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:24.479
and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.201
kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,

00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:27.501
and everyone could have access.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.634
So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:33.295
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:36.643
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.350
private-based learning.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.974
And lo and behold, we gave birth to

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.222
the first edible wall in New York City.

00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:44.382
So if you're hungry, get up and eat.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:46.206
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.

00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:49.558
Okay? But we were just getting started,

00:02:49.558 --> 00:02:50.927
the kids loved the technology,

00:02:50.927 --> 00:02:53.272
so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.127
Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.904
which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --

00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:00.910
We decided to go to Boston.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.336
And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:06.601
became the first to install a green wall,

00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:08.886
designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.435
21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it,

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.494
it's on top of the John Hancock building.

00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:15.286
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:17.206
that look like this with lighting like that,

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:20.295
real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:22.614
And what do you know? We made 21st century money,

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:25.433
and that was groundbreaking. Wow!

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.245
This is my harvest, people.

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:31.002
And what do you do with this food? You cook it!

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.906
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:36.368
with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:38.568
and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.779
And that is the youngest nationally certified

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.602
workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.

00:03:43.602 --> 00:03:46.506
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:48.243
and they invited us to the Hamptons.

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:50.514
So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."

00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:53.019
And we started putting in roofs that look like this,

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.307
and we came in from destitute neighborhoods

00:03:55.307 --> 00:03:58.875
to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:00.869
And so we got invited back this past summer,

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:02.628
and we actually moved into the Hamptons,

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:05.451
payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:08.227
And when you can do stuff like this --

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:11.443
These are my kids putting in this technology,

00:04:11.443 --> 00:04:13.980
and when you can build a roof that looks like that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.394
on a house that looks like that

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:19.204
with sedum that looks like this,

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.946
this is the new green graffiti.

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:25.451
So, you may wonder what does a wall like this

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.011
really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?

00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:29.907
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.

00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:32.227
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,

00:04:32.227 --> 00:04:34.379
Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.112
And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:40.601
Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.485
really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:45.683
for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.

00:04:45.683 --> 00:04:48.027
And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.

00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.867
Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:52.882
out of work looking to manage a million dollars.

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.291
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed

00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:57.302
or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months

00:04:57.302 --> 00:04:59.755
for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.

00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:01.534
That's the beauty of this economy.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:04.868
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.844
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.

00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:11.253
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:13.635
And this is the true triple bottom line,

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:15.890
because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.811
and turn them into something like this with interiors like this.

00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:20.890
Wow! People noticed. And notice they did.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.386
So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:26.954
And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.858
could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.

00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:32.850
But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.570
can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.735
design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:40.754
that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:43.139
Really scholastic, if you ask me.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.410
But this is not a Getty image.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.986
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,

00:05:47.986 --> 00:05:51.201
addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:52.748
making them feel a part of it.

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:55.102
That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,

00:05:55.102 --> 00:05:57.702
coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.

00:05:57.702 --> 00:05:59.420
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.602
and the State Senator comes to our class,

00:06:01.602 --> 00:06:05.346
believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:06.868
We are poised, ready, willing and able

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:10.068
to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:12.134
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:15.347
and says he's got to lose weight, so do I!

00:06:15.347 --> 00:06:18.212
And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.290
Okay? And then celebrities started.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.306
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.522
Lorna Sass came and donated books.

00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:26.754
Okay? We're feeding seniors.

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:30.315
And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,

00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:32.200
so did the international community.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.770
And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.946
the first international green roof conference.

00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:37.378
And that's just great.

00:06:37.378 --> 00:06:38.989
Except what about locally?

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:42.053
Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.413
Unbelievable! Through her, my kids,

00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:46.541
the most disenfranchised and marginalized,

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:50.310
were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.167
That's triple bottom line! Okay?

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:56.102
A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.

00:06:56.102 --> 00:06:59.566
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:02.277
made sense, especially when the resources were free.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:04.053
So thank you all and I love them.

00:07:04.053 --> 00:07:07.071
They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,

00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:10.035
again, free resources, don't waste them.

00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:12.181
And what do you know? Six months later,

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.280
my school and my kids were awarded the first ever

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.967
high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.

00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:21.093
The greenest class in New York City.

00:07:21.093 --> 00:07:23.535
But more importantly is my kids learned to get,

00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:25.168
they learned to give.

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:27.637
And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,

00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:29.085
and started buying gifts for the homeless

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:30.525
and for needy around the world.

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:31.935
So we started giving back.

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:34.434
And that's when I realized that the greening of America

00:07:34.434 --> 00:07:37.669
starts first with the pockets, then with the heart

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:38.887
and then with the mind.

00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.218
So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.

00:07:41.218 --> 00:07:43.052
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,

00:07:43.052 --> 00:07:46.285
because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.

00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:48.092
We're 3,000 strong right now.

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:49.413
And what does it really do?

00:07:49.413 --> 00:07:51.447
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:54.493
so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.

00:07:54.493 --> 00:07:56.636
And my kids, trained and certified --

00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:58.628
Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg --

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.335
can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,

00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:05.724
and that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:07.804
Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.

00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:09.524
No more little Knicks and little Nets.

00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:12.934
Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:14.565
something you can aspire to.

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:16.612
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,

00:08:16.612 --> 00:08:19.085
growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,

00:08:19.085 --> 00:08:20.812
the most migrant community in America.

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:22.900
When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.261
it's no wonder we get fruit like that.

00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:27.252
And I love it! And so do they.

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:30.167
And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:32.540
And that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.917
And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people

00:08:35.917 --> 00:08:38.335
without a food stamp or a fingerprint.

00:08:38.335 --> 00:08:40.388
The poorest congressional district in America,

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:43.572
the most migratory community in America, we can do this.

00:08:43.572 --> 00:08:47.276
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.580
moving kids into an economy they never imagined.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.044
Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:55.772
is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:58.627
How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.

00:08:58.627 --> 00:09:01.268
Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,

00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:02.844
and not aisle 9 at the supermarket

00:09:02.844 --> 00:09:05.635
or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:08.335
And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.

00:09:08.335 --> 00:09:11.389
And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:15.022
And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:17.369
you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:20.801
and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:23.390
God, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.590
But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.255
This is what we're doing.

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:32.734
And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:36.077
Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.237
I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.

00:09:38.237 --> 00:09:39.778
But those kids are the kids who are now putting

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:41.654
pumpkin patches on top of trains.

00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:44.495
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.

00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:46.201
We're also becoming children of the corn,

00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.805
creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness

00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:50.358
and window bottles out of garbage.

00:09:50.358 --> 00:09:52.157
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:55.518
but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.

00:09:55.518 --> 00:09:58.005
I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!

00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:00.389
So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:04.189
Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:06.268
Or more importantly, to local shelters,

00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:08.621
where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.

00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:10.309
And we're stepping it up.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.871
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:16.150
And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.790
Let me tell you something, people.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.696
This is a beautiful moment.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:24.881
Black field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield --

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:27.736
we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.

00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:31.657
And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.

00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:33.689
We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.

00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:37.057
And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.

00:10:37.057 --> 00:10:39.953
And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse

00:10:39.953 --> 00:10:42.010
as this to do something as special as this,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.734
we're really creating a moment.

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:46.450
Now, you may ask about these kids.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.631
Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.

00:10:49.631 --> 00:10:52.520
All start overage and under-credit.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.456
They are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:58.737
The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.

00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:01.689
Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:05.825
Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:08.088
Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint?

00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:10.276
I grow seven kinds of mint in my class.

00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:12.427
Mojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.

00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:15.622
But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.

00:11:15.622 --> 00:11:18.822
Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:

00:11:18.822 --> 00:11:21.558
The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats

00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:23.710
is becoming home to the organic ones.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.646
My green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,

00:11:26.646 --> 00:11:29.958
I'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.668
So help us go from this to this.

00:11:32.668 --> 00:11:35.958
Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.150
plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.006
while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:43.622
Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.

00:11:43.622 --> 00:11:46.887
So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,

00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:49.534
to help us make America great again.

00:11:49.534 --> 00:11:51.478
It's simple. Share your passion.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:53.903
It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.

00:11:53.903 --> 00:11:56.802
One got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.

00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:59.436
And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:01.541
This has got to go tomorrow.

00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:03.602
People, you can all do that.

00:12:03.602 --> 00:12:06.838
Keep kids out of stores that look like this.

00:12:06.838 --> 00:12:08.535
Make them a healthy plate,

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:11.286
especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!

00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:14.622
Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart.

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:16.838
Big kids love strawberries and bananas.

00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:19.854
Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.

00:12:19.854 --> 00:12:23.086
Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:25.005
But most importantly, just love them.

00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:27.319
Nothing works like unconditional love.

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:30.526
So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.

00:12:30.526 --> 00:12:33.210
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.235
35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,

00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:38.886
where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.

00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:43.273
Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,

00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:46.536
we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:48.788
So here, and at a time when we've gone from

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:51.343
the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,

00:12:51.343 --> 00:12:53.238
I urge you to do something.

00:12:53.238 --> 00:12:54.709
I urge you to do something.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.453
Right now, we're all tadpoles,

00:12:56.453 --> 00:12:59.747
but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.

00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:03.041
I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.

00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:06.801
Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.

00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:09.435
We can do something here.

00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:12.105
And along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.642
especially if you and your students grew them.

00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:16.241
I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.

00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.610
I've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.368
thank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.802
believing and supporting me.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.935
We are growing our way into a new economy.

00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:28.136
Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:30.302
Sí se puede!

00:13:30.302 --> 00:13:35.673
(Applause)
