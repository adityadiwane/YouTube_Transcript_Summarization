00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.170
The first time I cried underwater

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:16.737
was in 2008,

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.338
the island of Curaçao,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.244
way down in the southern Caribbean.

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.320
It's beautiful there.

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:25.270
I was studying these corals for my PhD,

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:27.676
and after days and days
of diving on the same reef,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.729
I had gotten to know them as individuals.

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:32.224
I had made friends with coral colonies --

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.002
totally a normal thing to do.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.776
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
and ripped off their skin,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.289
leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing,

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:47.620
and big patches of dead skeleton
that would get overgrown by algae.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.225
When I saw this damage for the first time,

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.059
stretching all the way down the reef,

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:53.940
I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:55.360
and I cried.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:57.741
If a coral could die that fast,

00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:59.654
how could a reef ever survive?

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:03.133
And why was I making it my job
to try to fight for them?

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.704
I never heard another scientist
tell that kind of story

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:08.094
until last year.

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:10.628
A scientist in Guam wrote,

00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:12.199
"I cried right into my mask,"

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.433
seeing the damage on the reefs.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.410
Then a scientist in Australia wrote,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:20.431
"I showed my students
the results of our coral surveys,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.807
and we wept."

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.364
Crying about corals
is having a moment, guys.

00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:26.522
(Laughter)

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:28.490
And that's because reefs in the Pacific

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:31.348
are losing corals faster
than we've ever seen before.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.961
Because of climate change,

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:35.794
the water is so hot for so long
in the summers,

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:37.993
that these animals
can't function normally.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:41.522
They're spitting out the colored algae
that lives in their skin,

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:46.611
and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:47.889
and then rots away.

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.307
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.104
This is happening
over an unbelievable scale.

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:58.264
The Northern Great Barrier Reef
lost two-thirds of its corals last year

00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:00.843
over a distance of hundreds of miles,

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:02.669
then bleached again this year,

00:02:02.693 --> 00:02:04.811
and the bleaching stretched further south.

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:08.138
Reefs in the Pacific
are in a nosedive right now,

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:10.701
and no one knows
how bad it's going to get,

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:12.094
except ...

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:14.057
over in the Caribbean where I work,

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.159
we've already been through the nosedive.

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.463
Reefs there have suffered
through centuries of intense human abuse.

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.947
We kind of already know
how the story goes.

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:27.109
And we might be able to help predict
what happens next.

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.349
Let's consult a graph.

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:33.823
Since the invention of scuba,

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:36.828
scientists have measured
the amount of coral on the seafloor,

00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:38.518
and how it's changed through time.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.677
And after centuries
of ratcheting human pressure,

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.302
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:47.020
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.509
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.526
but kind of ended up in the same place.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.487
OK, so far this is not going very well.

00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:00.327
But some reefs in the Caribbean --

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.244
the ones best protected

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.982
and the ones a little
further from humans --

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:08.547
they managed to hold onto their corals.

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:10.710
Give us a challenge.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.565
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.596
The second time I cried underwater

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.030
was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.

00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:23.738
It was the calmest day of the year,

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:26.131
but it's always pretty
sketchy diving there.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.251
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.949
I watched my compass
so we could find our way back out,

00:03:30.973 --> 00:03:32.603
and he watched for sharks,

00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:35.483
and after 20 minutes of swimming
that felt like an hour,

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.223
we finally dropped down to the reef,

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:38.806
and I was so shocked,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.476
and I was so happy

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.495
that my eyes filled with tears.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.144
There were corals 1,000 years old
lined up one after another.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:53.682
They had survived the entire history
of European colonialism in the Caribbean,

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.841
and for centuries before that.

00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:01.623
I never knew what a coral could do
when it was given a chance to thrive.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.043
The truth is that even
as we lose so many corals,

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.123
even as we go through
this massive coral die-off,

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:10.998
some reefs will survive.

00:04:11.732 --> 00:04:13.386
Some will be ragged on the edge,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.299
some will be beautiful.

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.602
And by protecting shorelines
and giving us food to eat

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.375
and supporting tourism,

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.521
they will still be worth
billions and billions of dollars a year.

00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:26.634
The best time to protect a reef
was 50 years ago,

00:04:26.658 --> 00:04:29.576
but the second-best time is right now.

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.066
Even as we go through bleaching events,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.633
more frequent and in more places,

00:04:35.657 --> 00:04:37.932
some corals will be able to recover.

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.644
We had a bleaching event
in 2010 in the Caribbean

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:45.253
that took off big patches of skin
on boulder corals like these.

00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:48.785
This coral lost half of its skin.

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:53.036
But if you look at the side
of this coral a few years later,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.408
this coral is actually healthy again.

00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:57.729
It's doing what a healthy coral does.

00:04:57.753 --> 00:04:59.851
It's making copies of its polyps,

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.330
it's fighting back the algae

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:03.126
and it's reclaiming its territory.

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:05.360
If a few polyps survive,

00:05:05.384 --> 00:05:06.557
a coral can regrow;

00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:10.686
it just needs time and protection
and a reasonable temperature.

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.997
Some corals can regrow in 10 years --

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.744
others take a lot longer.

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:17.419
But the more stresses
we take off them locally --

00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:21.437
things like overfishing,
sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.906
dredging, coastal construction --

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.800
the better they can hang on
as we stabilize the climate,

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.634
and the faster they can regrow.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:33.504
And as we go through the long,
tough and necessary process

00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:36.133
of stabilizing the climate
of planet Earth,

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:38.587
some new corals will still be born.

00:05:39.143 --> 00:05:41.050
This is what I study in my research.

00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:44.045
We try to understand
how corals make babies,

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.743
and how those babies
find their way to the reef,

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:49.069
and we invent new methods
to help them survive

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:51.026
those early, fragile life stages.

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:54.905
One of my favorite
coral babies of all time

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:56.939
showed up right after Hurricane Omar.

00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:59.654
It's the same species
I was studying before the storm,

00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:02.110
but you almost never see
babies of this species --

00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:03.349
it's really rare.

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:05.687
This is actually an endangered species.

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.715
In this photo, this little baby coral,
this little circle of polyps,

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:11.163
is a few years old.

00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:13.085
Like its cousins that bleach,

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:14.945
it's fighting back the algae.

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.894
And like its cousins on the north shore,

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.959
it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.

00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:23.868
What's happening in the world
and in the ocean

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:25.690
has changed our time horizon.

00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:29.496
We can be incredibly pessimistic
on the short term,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.835
and mourn what we lost

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:33.524
and what we really took for granted.

00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:36.778
But we can still be optimistic
on the long term,

00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:39.280
and we can still be ambitious
about what we fight for

00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:42.402
and what we expect from our governments,

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.717
from our planet.

00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:48.094
Corals have been living on planet Earth
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:50.311
They survived the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:51.600
They're badasses.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.666
(Laughter)

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.229
An individual coral can go through
tremendous trauma and fully recover

00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:01.039
if it's given a chance
and it's given protection.

00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:04.871
Corals have always
been playing the long game,

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:06.961
and now so are we.

00:07:07.612 --> 00:07:08.765
Thanks very much.

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.637
(Applause)
