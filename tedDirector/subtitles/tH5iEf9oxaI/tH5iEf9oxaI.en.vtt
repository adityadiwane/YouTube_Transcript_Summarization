00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:14.872
So my moment of truth

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.936
did not come all at once.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:21.562
In 2010, I had the chance to be considered

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.889
for promotion from my job

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.961
as director of policy planning

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.718
at the U.S. State Department.

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.449
This was my moment to lean in,

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.334
to push myself forward

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.028
for what are really only a handful

00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:41.045
of the very top foreign policy jobs,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:44.125
and I had just finished a big, 18-month project

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.698
for Secretary Clinton, successfully,

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:50.929
and I knew I could handle a bigger job.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.759
The woman I thought I was

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.930
would have said yes.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.957
But I had been commuting for two years

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:02.100
between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.027
where my husband and my two teenage sons lived,

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:09.293
and it was not going well.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:12.998
I tried on the idea of eking out another two years

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:15.794
in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:17.929
from their school and my husband from his work

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.510
and asking them to join me.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.549
But deep down, I knew

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.080
that the right decision was to go home,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.996
even if I didn't fully recognize the woman

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:33.988
who was making that choice.

00:01:33.988 --> 00:01:37.495
That was a decision based on love

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.439
and responsibility.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.338
I couldn't keep watching my oldest son

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:43.763
make bad choices

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:46.458
without being able to be there for him

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:50.241
when and if he needed me.

00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:53.755
But the real change came more gradually.

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:55.514
Over the next year,

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:58.389
while my family was righting itself,

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.053
I started to realize

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.992
that even if I could go back into government,

00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:04.772
I didn't want to.

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:08.719
I didn't want to miss the last five years

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.551
that my sons were at home.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.437
I finally allowed myself to accept

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.443
what was really most important to me,

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:21.852
not what I was conditioned to want

00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:26.550
or maybe what I conditioned myself to want,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.611
and that decision led to a reassessment

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.634
of the feminist narrative that I grew up with

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:38.290
and have always championed.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.142
I am still completely committed

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:47.327
to the cause of male-female equality,

00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:52.273
but let's think about what that equality really means,

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:55.200
and how best to achieve it.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.323
I always accepted the idea

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.248
that the most respected and powerful people

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:05.753
in our society are men at the top of their careers,

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:09.928
so that the measure of male-female equality

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:14.147
ought to be how many women are in those positions:

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:17.066
prime ministers, presidents, CEOs,

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:22.169
directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.446
I still think we should do everything we possibly can

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.526
to achieve that goal.

00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:33.651
But that's only half of real equality,

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:36.999
and I now think we're never going to get there

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:42.281
unless we recognize the other half.

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.592
I suggest that real equality,

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.863
full equality,

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:52.078
does not just mean valuing women

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.245
on male terms.

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:58.863
It means creating a much wider range

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.875
of equally respected choices

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.926
for women and for men.

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:09.395
And to get there, we have to change our workplaces,

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.309
our policies and our culture.

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.374
In the workplace,

00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:17.677
real equality means valuing family

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:19.300
just as much as work,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.863
and understanding that the two reinforce each other.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.766
As a leader and as a manager,

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.811
I have always acted on the mantra,

00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:31.091
if family comes first,

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.938
work does not come second --

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:36.242
life comes together.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:40.407
If you work for me, and you have a family issue,

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:42.841
I expect you to attend to it,

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.486
and I am confident,

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:47.183
and my confidence has always been borne out,

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:51.174
that the work will get done, and done better.

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:53.575
Workers who have a reason to get home

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.954
to care for their children or their family members

00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:59.461
are more focused, more efficient,

00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:01.484
more results-focused.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.613
And breadwinners who are also caregivers

00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:07.220
have a much wider range

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.746
of experiences and contacts.

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:12.978
Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.579
at school events for his kids

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:17.405
talking to other parents.

00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:19.463
He's much more likely to bring in

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:21.403
new clients for his firm

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:24.664
than a lawyer who never leaves his office.

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:26.553
And caregiving itself

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:30.335
develops patience --

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:32.798
a lot of patience --

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:38.418
and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.

00:05:38.418 --> 00:05:42.216
Those are all attributes that are ever more important

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.309
in a high-speed, horizontal,

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:48.758
networked global economy.

00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:51.946
The best companies actually know this.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.673
The companies that win awards

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:56.925
for workplace flexibility in the United States

00:05:56.925 --> 00:06:00.151
include some of our most successful corporations,

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.422
and a 2008 national study

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:04.475
on the changing workforce

00:06:04.475 --> 00:06:06.089
showed that employees

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.591
in flexible and effective workplaces

00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.304
are more engaged with their work,

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.794
they're more satisfied and more loyal,

00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:15.627
they have lower levels of stress

00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:18.026
and higher levels of mental health.

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:21.736
And a 2012 study of employers

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:24.589
showed that deep, flexible practices

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.979
actually lowered operating costs

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.444
and increased adaptability

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:32.531
in a global service economy.

00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:35.648
So you may think

00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:39.865
that the privileging of work over family

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:43.812
is only an American problem.

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:47.350
Sadly, though, the obsession with work

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.510
is no longer a uniquely American disease.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.282
Twenty years ago,

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:54.278
when my family first started going to Italy,

00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.881
we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.

00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:00.764
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.

00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:02.630
It's actually just as much

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.742
about embracing the warmth of a family lunch.

00:07:05.742 --> 00:07:08.945
Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:10.658
close for siesta,

00:07:10.658 --> 00:07:14.196
reflecting the advance of global corporations

00:07:14.196 --> 00:07:17.033
and 24-hour competition.

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:19.902
So making a place for those we love

00:07:19.902 --> 00:07:23.647
is actually a global imperative.

00:07:23.647 --> 00:07:26.377
In policy terms,

00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:29.813
real equality means recognizing

00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:32.771
that the work that women have traditionally done

00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:34.648
is just as important

00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:37.311
as the work that men have traditionally done,

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:40.363
no matter who does it.

00:07:40.363 --> 00:07:44.108
Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving

00:07:44.108 --> 00:07:47.633
are equally necessary for human survival.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.117
At least if we get beyond a barter economy,

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.354
somebody has to earn an income

00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:56.308
and someone else has to convert that income

00:07:56.308 --> 00:08:00.092
to care and sustenance for loved ones.

00:08:00.092 --> 00:08:02.230
Now most of you, when you hear me

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.955
talk about breadwinning and caregiving,

00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:08.396
instinctively translate those categories

00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:12.127
into men's work and women's work.

00:08:12.127 --> 00:08:14.963
And we don't typically challenge

00:08:14.963 --> 00:08:18.861
why men's work is advantaged.

00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:21.451
But consider a same-sex couple

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:23.470
like my friends Sarah and Emily.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.338
They're psychiatrists.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.167
They got married five years ago,

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:30.448
and now they have two-year-old twins.

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:32.520
They love being mothers,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.088
but they also love their work,

00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:36.298
and they're really good at what they do.

00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:38.319
So how are they going to divide up

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:40.796
breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?

00:08:40.796 --> 00:08:42.881
Should one of them stop working

00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:45.573
or reduce hours to be home?

00:08:45.573 --> 00:08:48.252
Or should they both change their practices

00:08:48.252 --> 00:08:51.535
so they can have much more flexible schedules?

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:53.506
And what criteria should they use

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.800
to make that decision?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.574
Is it who makes the most money

00:08:56.574 --> 00:09:00.351
or who is most committed to her career?

00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:04.912
Or who has the most flexible boss?

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:08.237
The same-sex perspective helps us see

00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:10.701
that juggling work and family

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:12.812
are not women's problems,

00:09:12.812 --> 00:09:15.450
they're family problems.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.473
And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,

00:09:18.473 --> 00:09:20.242
because they have a choice

00:09:20.242 --> 00:09:22.779
about how much they want to work.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:25.608
Millions of men and women

00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:28.945
have to be both breadwinners and caregivers

00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:32.485
just to earn the income they need,

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:35.033
and many of those workers are scrambling.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.917
They're patching together care arrangements

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:39.090
that are inadequate

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.501
and often actually unsafe.

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:46.191
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,

00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.779
then why shouldn't a government

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:51.595
invest as much in an infrastructure of care

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:55.454
as the foundation of a healthy society

00:09:55.454 --> 00:09:58.566
as it invests in physical infrastructure

00:09:58.566 --> 00:10:02.442
as the backbone of a successful economy?

00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:04.778
The governments that get it --

00:10:04.778 --> 00:10:06.625
no surprises here --

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.465
the governments that get it,

00:10:08.465 --> 00:10:13.170
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.100
provide universal child care,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.219
support for caregivers at home,

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:21.386
school and early childhood education,

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:23.596
protections for pregnant women,

00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:27.981
and care for the elderly and the disabled.

00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.662
Those governments invest in that infrastructure

00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:34.991
the same way they invest in roads and bridges

00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:38.126
and tunnels and trains.

00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:40.534
Those societies also show you

00:10:40.534 --> 00:10:42.824
that breadwinning and caregiving

00:10:42.824 --> 00:10:45.208
reinforce each other.

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:51.047
They routinely rank among the top 15 countries

00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:54.380
of the most globally competitive economies,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.032
but at the same time,

00:10:56.032 --> 00:11:00.723
they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:04.259
In fact, they rank higher than other governments,

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:06.928
like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,

00:11:06.928 --> 00:11:09.857
that have higher average levels of income

00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:15.620
but lower rankings on work-life balance.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.296
So changing our workplaces

00:11:18.296 --> 00:11:21.592
and building infrastructures of care

00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:23.067
would make a big difference,

00:11:23.067 --> 00:11:27.551
but we're not going to get equally valued choices

00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:30.056
unless we change our culture,

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:33.197
and the kind of cultural change required

00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:35.952
means re-socializing men.

00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:39.626
(Applause)

00:11:39.626 --> 00:11:41.361
Increasingly in developed countries,

00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:44.443
women are socialized to believe that our place

00:11:44.443 --> 00:11:48.103
is no longer only in the home,

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:52.999
but men are actually still where they always were.

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:56.397
Men are still socialized to believe

00:11:56.397 --> 00:11:58.652
that they have to be breadwinners,

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:01.527
that to derive their self-worth

00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:04.406
from how high they can climb over other men

00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:06.751
on a career ladder.

00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:09.534
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.

00:12:09.534 --> 00:12:11.436
It's certainly not complete.

00:12:11.436 --> 00:12:13.092
But 60 years after

00:12:13.092 --> 00:12:15.402
"The Feminine
Mystique" was published,

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.703
many women actually have

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.681
more choices than men do.

00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:23.409
We can decide to be a breadwinner,

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:27.556
a caregiver, or any combination of the two.

00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:30.082
When a man, on the other hand,

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.971
decides to be a caregiver,

00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:36.275
he puts his manhood on the line.

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:39.495
His friends may praise his decision,

00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:43.367
but underneath, they're scratching their heads.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:46.468
Isn't the measure of a man

00:12:46.468 --> 00:12:49.399
his willingness to compete with other men

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.779
for power and prestige?

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.875
And as many women hold that view as men do.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.841
We know that lots of women

00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.160
still judge the attractiveness of a man

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.885
based in large part on how successful he is

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:06.382
in his career.

00:13:06.382 --> 00:13:08.733
A woman can drop out of the work force

00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:10.893
and still be an attractive partner.

00:13:10.893 --> 00:13:15.432
For a man, that's a risky proposition.

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.673
So as parents and partners,

00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:20.860
we should be socializing our sons

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.311
and our husbands

00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:26.635
to be whatever they want to be,

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:30.254
either caregivers or breadwinners.

00:13:30.254 --> 00:13:33.610
We should be socializing them to make caregiving

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.597
cool for guys.

00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:39.362
(Applause)

00:13:39.362 --> 00:13:45.674
I can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way."

00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:50.321
But in fact, the change is 
actually already happening.

00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.278
At least in the United States,

00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:54.502
lots of men take pride in cooking,

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:57.818
and frankly obsess over stoves.

00:13:57.818 --> 00:14:00.805
They are in the birthing rooms.

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:03.449
They take paternity leave when they can.

00:14:03.449 --> 00:14:05.911
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:08.553
just as well as their wives can,

00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:10.302
and they are increasingly

00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:12.869
doing much more of the housework.

00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:14.957
Indeed, there are male college students now

00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:16.484
who are starting to say,

00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:18.360
"I want to be a stay-at-home dad."

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.611
That was completely unthinkable

00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:23.478
50 or even 30 years ago.

00:14:23.478 --> 00:14:26.369
And in Norway, where men have

00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:29.158
an automatic three month's paternity leave,

00:14:29.158 --> 00:14:32.495
but they lose it if they decide not to take it,

00:14:32.495 --> 00:14:34.420
a high government official told me

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.652
that companies are starting to look

00:14:36.652 --> 00:14:38.737
at prospective male employees

00:14:38.737 --> 00:14:42.715
and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.111
take their leave when they had kids.

00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:47.940
That means that it's starting to seem

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.142
like a character defect

00:14:50.142 --> 00:14:54.362
not to want to be a fully engaged father.

00:14:57.421 --> 00:15:02.943
So I was raised

00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:06.592
to believe that championing women's rights

00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:08.711
meant doing everything we could

00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:10.485
to get women to the top.

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.204
And I still hope that I live long enough

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.467
to see men and women equally represented

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:19.514
at all levels of the work force.

00:15:19.514 --> 00:15:23.613
But I've come to believe that we have to value family

00:15:23.613 --> 00:15:26.445
every bit as much as we value work,

00:15:26.445 --> 00:15:28.957
and that we should entertain the idea

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:32.506
that doing right by those we love

00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:36.422
will make all of us better at everything we do.

00:15:36.422 --> 00:15:38.490
Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.447
a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls

00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:44.504
and identified an ethic of care,

00:15:44.504 --> 00:15:47.659
an element of human nature every bit as important

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:49.646
as the ethic of justice.

00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:52.951
It turns out that "you don't care"

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.872
is just as much a part of who we are

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.152
as "that's not fair."

00:15:58.152 --> 00:15:59.952
Bill Gates agrees.

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:03.123
He argues that the two great forces of human nature

00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:07.330
are self-interest and caring for others.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.972
Let's bring them both together.

00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:12.631
Let's make the feminist revolution

00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:15.363
a humanist revolution.

00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:17.107
As whole human beings,

00:16:17.107 --> 00:16:20.951
we will be better caregivers and breadwinners.

00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:23.059
You may think that can't happen,

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:24.759
but I grew up in a society

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:27.105
where my mother put out small vases

00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:29.767
of cigarettes for dinner parties,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:33.960
where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.490
and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.

00:16:40.602 --> 00:16:45.041
Today, not so much.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:48.681
The revolution for human equality

00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:50.471
can happen.

00:16:50.471 --> 00:16:52.717
It is happening.

00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:54.999
It will happen.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:59.717
How far and how fast is up to us.

00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:01.860
Thank you.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.860
(Applause)
