00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:19.236
Khan Academy is most known
for its collection of videos,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.236
so before I go any further,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.599
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.695
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be five.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.012
This animal's fossils are only found
in this area of South America --

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:32.616
a nice clean band here --

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.829
and this part of Africa.

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:37.019
We can integrate over the surface,

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:39.884
and the notation
usually is a capital sigma.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:43.074
National Assembly: They create
the Committee of Public Safety,

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:45.059
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:48.788
Notice, this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.

00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:52.057
Start differentiating
into effector and memory cells.

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.801
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.
Oh, look! There's another galaxy.

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.236
And for dollars, is their 30 million,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.299
plus the 20 million dollars
from the American manufacturer.

00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:04.823
If this does not blow your mind,

00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:06.854
then you have no emotion.

00:01:06.878 --> 00:01:08.236
(Laughter)

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.775
(Applause)

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.780
(Live) SK: We now have
on the order of 2,200 videos,

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:21.995
covering everything from basic arithmetic,
all the way to vector calculus,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.236
and some of the stuff
that you saw up there.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.664
We have a million students
a month using the site,

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:31.236
watching on the order
of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.910
But what we're going to talk about in this
is how we're going to the next level.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:37.236
But before I do that,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.624
I want to talk a little bit
about really just how I got started.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.481
And some of you all might know,

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.526
about five years ago,
I was an analyst at a hedge fund,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.018
and I was in Boston,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.130
and I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans, remotely.

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:54.495
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.353
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,

00:01:56.377 --> 00:01:58.502
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,

00:01:58.526 --> 00:02:01.534
something that might give them
a refresher or something.

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:04.198
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,

00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:05.726
something interesting happened.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.094
Actually, a bunch of interesting
things happened.

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:10.356
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:15.708
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:22.260
(Laughter)

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:27.023
And once you get over
the backhanded nature of that,

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.355
there was actually something
very profound there.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.205
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.379
to their cousin.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.329
At first it's very unintuitive,

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:40.111
but when you think about it from their
point of view, it makes a ton of sense.

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:43.955
You have this situation where now
they can pause and repeat their cousin,

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.003
without feeling
like they're wasting my time.

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:49.399
If they have to review something

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:51.978
that they should have learned
a couple of weeks ago,

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.224
or maybe a couple of years ago,

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:56.906
they don't have to be embarrassed
and ask their cousin.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.272
They can just watch those videos;
if they're bored, they can go ahead.

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.320
They can watch at their own time and pace.

00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:07.145
Probably the least-appreciated aspect
of this

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.740
is the notion that the very first time

00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:13.612
that you're trying to get
your brain around a new concept,

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:15.236
the very last thing you need

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.002
is another human being saying,
"Do you understand this?"

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:19.848
And that's what was happening

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:21.967
with the interaction
with my cousins before,

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:27.497
and now they can just do it
in the intimacy of their own room.

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:30.270
The other thing that happened is --

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.108
I put them on YouTube just --

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.610
I saw no reason to make it private,

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.236
so I let other people watch it,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.236
and then people started stumbling on it,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.758
and I started getting
some comments and some letters

00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:44.988
and all sorts of feedback

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:46.948
from random people around the world.

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:48.646
These are just a few.

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:52.948
This is actually from one
of the original calculus videos.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.521
Someone wrote it on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment:

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.236
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.156
(Laughter)

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.982
Let's pause here.

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:05.958
This person did a derivative,

00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:07.159
and then they smiled.

00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:08.964
(Laughter)

00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:10.671
In response to that same comment --

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:14.146
this is on the thread, you can go
on YouTube and look at the comments --

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.948
someone else wrote: "Same thing here.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:19.045
I actually got a natural high
and a good mood for the entire day,

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.497
since I remember seeing
all of this matrix text in class,

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:26.236
and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.521
(Laughter)

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:32.896
We get a lot of feedback
along those lines.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.601
This clearly was helping people.

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.327
But then, as the viewership
kept growing and kept growing,

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:40.922
I started getting letters from people,

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.683
and it was starting to become clear

00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:44.789
that it was more than just a nice-to-have.

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:48.236
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters:

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.731
"My 12 year-old son has autism,

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.977
and has had a terrible time with math.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.236
We have tried everything,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.236
viewed everything, bought everything.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.945
We stumbled on your video
on decimals, and it got through.

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.953
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.

00:05:01.977 --> 00:05:03.128
Again, he got it.

00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:04.318
We could not believe it.

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:05.559
He is so excited."

00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:07.810
And so you can imagine,

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:11.968
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:15.261
it was very strange for me to do
something of social value.

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:17.236
(Laughter)

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.940
(Applause)

00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:27.236
But I was excited, so I kept going.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.958
And then a few other things
started to dawn on me;

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:32.450
that not only would it
help my cousins right now,

00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:34.529
or these people who were sending letters,

00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:37.425
but that this content will never grow old,

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.743
that it could help their kids
or their grandkids.

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:45.529
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.791
I wouldn't have to.

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:48.600
(Laughter)

00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:51.236
Assuming he was good. We don't know.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.862
(Laughter)

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.926
The other thing that happened --
and even at this point, I said,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.164
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.
It's good for motivated students.

00:06:00.188 --> 00:06:02.014
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."

00:06:02.038 --> 00:06:05.313
But I didn't think it would somehow
penetrate the classroom.

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:07.463
Then I started getting
letters from teachers,

00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:09.312
and the teachers would write, saying,

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.557
"We've used your videos
to flip the classroom.

00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:14.158
You've given the lectures,
so now what we do --"

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:17.720
And this could happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow --

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.998
"what I do is I assign
the lectures for homework,

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:23.045
and what used to be homework,

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.021
I now have the students
doing in the classroom."

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:28.513
And I want to pause here --

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:33.130
(Applause)

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:36.451
I want to pause here, because there's
a couple of interesting things.

00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:38.676
One, when those teachers are doing that,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.236
there's the obvious benefit --

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.760
the benefit that now their students

00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:45.306
can enjoy the videos in the way
that my cousins did,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.736
they can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.941
But the more interesting thing --
and this is the unintuitive thing

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:54.343
when you talk about technology
in the classroom --

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:57.253
by removing the one-size-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,

00:06:57.277 --> 00:07:00.277
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home,

00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:01.952
then when you go to the classroom,

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:04.476
letting them do work,
having the teacher walk around,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.586
having the peers actually be able
to interact with each other,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.244
these teachers have used technology
to humanize the classroom.

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:15.730
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience --

00:07:15.754 --> 00:07:18.245
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:20.223
not allowed to interact with each other.

00:07:20.247 --> 00:07:21.739
A teacher, no matter how good,

00:07:21.763 --> 00:07:25.072
has to give this one-size-fits-all
lecture to 30 students --

00:07:25.096 --> 00:07:27.459
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:29.054
and now it's a human experience,

00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:31.387
now they're actually
interacting with each other.

00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:34.196
So once the Khan Academy --

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.372
I quit my job,

00:07:35.396 --> 00:07:37.840
and we turned into a real organization --

00:07:37.864 --> 00:07:39.657
we're a not-for-profit --

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:42.775
the question is, how do we take this
to the next level?

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:46.307
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.236
And so, what I'm showing over here,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.894
these are actual exercises

00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:53.236
that I started writing for my cousins.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.356
The ones I started
were much more primitive.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.750
This is a more competent version of it.

00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:02.163
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
as many questions as you need,

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:05.236
until you get that concept,
until you get 10 in a row.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.236
And the Khan Academy videos are there.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.593
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,

00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:11.574
if you don't know how to do it.

00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:13.908
The paradigm here seems
like a very simple thing:

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:15.130
10 in a row, you move on.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:16.734
But it's fundamentally different

00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:19.045
than what's happening
in classrooms right now.

00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:20.971
In a traditional classroom,

00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:24.236
you have homework, lecture,
homework, lecture,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.099
and then you have a snapshot exam.

00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.780
And that exam, whether you get
a 70 percent, an 80 percent,

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:31.249
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,

00:08:31.273 --> 00:08:33.716
the class moves on to the next topic.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.485
And even that 95 percent student --

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.518
what was the five percent
they didn't know?

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:41.363
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zeroth power.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.636
Then you build on that
in the next concept.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.000
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:49.893
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:53.830
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
then I come back after two weeks,

00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:57.004
and say, "Well, let's see.
You're having trouble taking left turns.

00:08:57.028 --> 00:09:00.265
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.711
So I put a big "C" stamp
on your forehead --

00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:03.797
(Laughter)

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:05.583
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:06.701
(Laughter)

00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:08.560
But as ridiculous as that sounds,

00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:12.236
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.869
And the idea is you fast forward

00:09:14.893 --> 00:09:17.879
and good students start failing
algebra all of the sudden,

00:09:17.903 --> 00:09:20.207
and start failing
calculus all of the sudden,

00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:22.589
despite being smart,
despite having good teachers,

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:25.357
and it's usually because they have
these Swiss cheese gaps

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.590
that kept building
throughout their foundation.

00:09:27.614 --> 00:09:31.192
So our model is: learn math
the way you'd learn anything,

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:32.562
like riding a bicycle.

00:09:32.586 --> 00:09:35.657
Stay on that bicycle.
Fall off that bicycle.

00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:38.712
Do it as long as necessary,
until you have mastery.

00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:40.236
The traditional model,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.832
it penalizes you
for experimentation and failure,

00:09:42.856 --> 00:09:44.879
but it does not expect mastery.

00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:47.967
We encourage you to experiment.
We encourage you to fail.

00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:49.641
But we do expect mastery.

00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.101
This is just another one of the modules.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.545
This is trigonometry.

00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:57.084
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.235
And they all fit together.

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:01.217
We have about 90 of these right now.

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:02.850
You can go to the site right now,

00:10:02.874 --> 00:10:04.946
it's all free,
not trying to sell anything.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.110
But the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map.

00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:11.253
That top node right there,
that's literally single-digit addition,

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.552
it's like one plus one is equal to two.

00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:15.928
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,

00:10:15.952 --> 00:10:19.135
it keeps forwarding you
to more and more advanced modules.

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:22.238
Further down the knowledge map,

00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:24.509
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:27.706
Further down, you start getting
into pre-algebra and early algebra.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.473
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.029
a little bit of precalculus.

00:10:33.402 --> 00:10:36.599
And the idea is, from this we can
actually teach everything --

00:10:36.623 --> 00:10:40.465
well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.

00:10:40.489 --> 00:10:43.298
So you can imagine -- and this
is what we are working on --

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:46.885
from this knowledge map, you have
logic, you have computer programming,

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:49.409
you have grammar, you have genetics,

00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:52.592
all based off of that core of,
if you know this and that,

00:10:52.616 --> 00:10:54.956
now you're ready for this next concept.

00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:58.171
Now that can work well
for an individual learner,

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:00.327
and I encourage you
to do it with your kids,

00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.390
but I also encourage everyone
in the audience to do it yourself.

00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:05.616
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.796
But what we want to do

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.898
is use the natural conclusion
of the flipping of the classroom

00:11:09.922 --> 00:11:12.295
that those early teachers
had emailed me about.

00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:13.912
And so what I'm showing you here,

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:16.824
this is data from a pilot
in the Los Altos school district,

00:11:16.848 --> 00:11:20.164
where they took two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes,

00:11:20.188 --> 00:11:22.439
and completely gutted
their old math curriculum.

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:25.898
These kids aren't using textbooks,
or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.

00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:29.915
They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
for roughly half of their math class.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.146
I want to be clear: we don't view this
as a complete math education.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.068
What it does is -- this is
what's happening in Los Altos --

00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:38.493
it frees up time --
it's the blocking and tackling,

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:41.493
making sure you know how to move
through a system of equations,

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.152
and it frees up time
for the simulations, for the games,

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:46.192
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:49.098
for the estimating how high
that hill is based on its shadow.

00:11:49.122 --> 00:11:51.678
And so the paradigm is
the teacher walks in every day,

00:11:51.702 --> 00:11:53.480
every kid works at their own pace --

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:57.035
this is actually a live dashboard
from the Los Altos school district --

00:11:57.059 --> 00:11:58.630
and they look at this dashboard.

00:11:58.654 --> 00:12:00.344
Every row is a student.

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:02.236
Every column is one of those concepts.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.403
Green means the student's
already proficient.

00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:06.951
Blue means they're working
on it -- no need to worry.

00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:08.236
Red means they're stuck.

00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:11.933
And what the teacher does
is literally just say,

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:13.632
"Let me intervene on the red kids."

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:16.021
Or even better, "Let me get
one of the green kids,

00:12:16.045 --> 00:12:18.091
who are already proficient
in that concept,

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:21.628
to be the first line of attack,
and actually tutor their peer."

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.861
(Applause)

00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:32.236
Now, I come from a very
data-centric reality,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.999
so we don't want that teacher
to even go and intervene

00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:37.069
and have to ask the kid awkward questions:

00:12:37.093 --> 00:12:40.403
"What don't you understand? What do
you understand?" and all the rest.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.662
So our paradigm is to arm teachers
with as much data as possible --

00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:45.736
data that, in any other
field, is expected,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.799
in finance, marketing, manufacturing --

00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:50.620
so the teachers can diagnose
what's wrong with the students

00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:53.532
so they can make their interaction
as productive as possible.

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:56.390
Now teachers know exactly
what the students have been up to,

00:12:56.414 --> 00:12:59.299
how long they've spent each day,
what videos they've watched,

00:12:59.323 --> 00:13:02.157
when did they pause the videos,
what did they stop watching,

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:04.904
what exercises are they using,
what have they focused on?

00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:07.801
The outer circle shows
what exercises they were focused on.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:10.530
The inner circle shows
the videos they're focused on.

00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:12.578
The data gets pretty granular,

00:13:12.602 --> 00:13:15.689
so you can see the exact problems
the student got right or wrong.

00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:17.442
Red is wrong, blue is right.

00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:20.440
The leftmost question is the first one
the student attempted.

00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:22.106
They watched the video over there.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.074
And you can see, eventually
they were able to get 10 in a row.

00:13:25.098 --> 00:13:28.453
It's almost like you can see them
learning over those last 10 problems.

00:13:28.477 --> 00:13:31.564
They also got faster -- the height
is how long it took them.

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:37.980
When you talk about self-paced learning,
it makes sense for everyone --

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:40.425
in education-speak,
"differentiated learning" --

00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:44.131
but it's kind of crazy, what happens
when you see it in a classroom.

00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:48.599
Because every time we've done this,
in every classroom we've done,

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:50.947
over and over again,
if you go five days into it,

00:13:50.971 --> 00:13:52.984
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead

00:13:53.008 --> 00:13:54.921
and a group who are a little bit slower.

00:13:54.945 --> 00:13:57.348
In a traditional model,
in a snapshot assessment,

00:13:57.372 --> 00:14:00.284
you say, "These are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.

00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:02.276
Maybe they should be tracked differently.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.530
Maybe we should put them
in different classes."

00:14:04.554 --> 00:14:06.958
But when you let students
work at their own pace --

00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:08.583
we see it over and over again --

00:14:08.607 --> 00:14:11.032
you see students who took
a little bit extra time

00:14:11.056 --> 00:14:12.907
on one concept or the other,

00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:15.127
but once they get through that concept,

00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:16.499
they just race ahead.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.895
And so the same kids that you
thought were slow six weeks ago,

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.578
you now would think are gifted.

00:14:21.602 --> 00:14:23.594
And we're seeing it over and over again.

00:14:23.618 --> 00:14:25.403
It makes you really wonder

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:28.726
how much all of the labels maybe
a lot of us have benefited from

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.332
were really just due
to a coincidence of time.

00:14:34.487 --> 00:14:39.519
Now as valuable as something like this is
in a district like Los Altos,

00:14:39.543 --> 00:14:41.236
our goal is to use technology

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.236
to humanize, not just in Los Altos,
but on a global scale,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.763
what's happening in education.

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:49.088
And that brings up an interesting point.

00:14:49.112 --> 00:14:51.842
A lot of the effort
in humanizing the classroom

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:54.786
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.309
In our mind, the relevant metric is:

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:01.235
student-to-valuable-human-time-
with-the-teacher ratio.

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.784
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time

00:15:03.808 --> 00:15:06.180
is spent doing lectures
and grading and whatnot.

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:09.100
Maybe five percent of their time
is sitting next to students

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:10.284
and working with them.

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:12.315
Now, 100 percent of their time is.

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:15.609
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:17.991
you're humanizing
the classroom, I'd argue,

00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:20.029
by a factor of five or 10.

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.386
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.451
imagine what it does to the adult learner,

00:15:24.475 --> 00:15:26.538
who's embarrassed to go back
and learn stuff

00:15:26.562 --> 00:15:29.014
they should have known
before going back to college.

00:15:29.038 --> 00:15:34.971
Imagine what it does
to a street kid in Calcutta,

00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:37.737
who has to help his family during the day,

00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:40.167
and that's the reason
he or she can't go to school.

00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.674
Now they can spend two hours
a day and remediate,

00:15:42.698 --> 00:15:45.023
or get up to speed
and not feel embarrassed

00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:47.236
about what they do or don't know.

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:49.294
Now imagine what happens where --

00:15:49.318 --> 00:15:52.229
we talked about the peers
teaching each other

00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:54.062
inside of a classroom.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.816
But this is all one system.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.142
There's no reason why you can't
have that peer-to-peer tutoring

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.236
beyond that one classroom.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.236
Imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.428
all of the sudden can tutor your son,

00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:08.913
or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.

00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:11.236
And I think what you'll see emerging

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.163
is this notion of a global
one-world classroom.

00:16:17.862 --> 00:16:21.236
And that's essentially
what we're trying to build.

00:16:21.822 --> 00:16:22.974
Thank you.

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:29.909
(Applause)

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.656
Bill Gates: I'll ask about two
or three questions.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.402
Salman Khan: Oh, OK.

00:16:35.426 --> 00:16:36.759
(Applause continues)

00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:04.320
(Applause ends)

00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:07.280
BG: I've seen some things
you're doing in the system,

00:17:07.304 --> 00:17:09.741
that have to do with motivation
and feedback --

00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:12.236
energy points, merit badges.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.291
Tell me what you're thinking there.

00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:16.911
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have
an awesome team working on it.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:19.038
I have to be clear,
it's not just me anymore.

00:17:19.062 --> 00:17:20.547
I'm still doing all the videos,

00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.873
but we have a rock-star team
doing the software.

00:17:22.897 --> 00:17:26.056
We've put a bunch of game mechanics
in there, where you get badges,

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.339
we're going to start having leader boards
by area, you get points.

00:17:29.363 --> 00:17:31.189
It's actually been pretty interesting.

00:17:31.213 --> 00:17:32.772
Just the wording of the badging,

00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:35.003
or how many points you get
for doing something,

00:17:35.027 --> 00:17:36.664
we see on a system-wide basis,

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.326
like tens of thousands
of fifth-graders or sixth-graders

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.525
going one direction or another,
depending what badge you give them.

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:44.612
(Laughter)

00:17:44.636 --> 00:17:47.236
BG: And the collaboration
you're doing with Los Altos,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.437
how did that come about?

00:17:49.461 --> 00:17:52.500
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.

00:17:52.524 --> 00:17:55.333
Once again, I didn't expect it
to be used in classrooms.

00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:57.236
Someone from their board came and said,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.087
"What would you do if you had
carte Blanche in a classroom?"

00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:03.127
I said, "Well, every student
would work at their own pace,

00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:05.348
on something like this,
we'd give a dashboard."

00:18:05.372 --> 00:18:08.571
They said, "This is kind of radical.
We have to think about it."

00:18:08.595 --> 00:18:12.397
Me and the rest of the team were like,
"They're never going to want to do this."

00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:15.842
But literally the next day they were like,
"Can you start in two weeks?"

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:17.317
(Laughter)

00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:20.238
BG: So fifth-grade math
is where that's going on right now?

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:23.261
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes.

00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:25.151
They're doing it at the district level.

00:18:25.175 --> 00:18:28.247
I think what they're excited about
is they can follow these kids,

00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:31.684
not only in school; on Christmas,
we saw some of the kids were doing it.

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:35.236
We can track everything, track them
as they go through the entire district.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.188
Through the summers, as they go
from one teacher to the next,

00:18:38.212 --> 00:18:42.012
you have this continuity of data that
even at the district level, they can see.

00:18:42.036 --> 00:18:45.236
BG: So some of those views we saw
were for the teacher

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.951
to go in and track actually
what's going on with those kids.

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:51.301
So you're getting feedback
on those teacher views

00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:53.038
to see what they think they need?

00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:57.418
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those
were specs by the teachers.

00:18:57.442 --> 00:19:00.452
We made some of those for students
so they could see their data,

00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:03.588
but we have a very tight design loop
with the teachers themselves.

00:19:03.612 --> 00:19:05.836
And they're saying,
"Hey, this is nice, but --"

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.249
Like that focus graph,
a lot of the teachers said,

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:10.813
"I have a feeling a lot of the kids
are jumping around

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:12.439
and not focusing on one topic."

00:19:12.463 --> 00:19:13.936
So we made that focus diagram.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.600
So it's all been teacher-driven.
It's been pretty crazy.

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:18.197
BG: Is this ready for prime time?

00:19:18.221 --> 00:19:22.575
Do you think a lot of classes next school
year should try this thing out?

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:23.757
SK: Yeah, it's ready.

00:19:23.781 --> 00:19:26.499
We've got a million people
on the site already,

00:19:26.523 --> 00:19:29.455
so we can handle a few more.

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:31.236
(Laughter)

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.236
No, no reason why it really can't happen

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.870
in every classroom in America tomorrow.

00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:38.374
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.

00:19:38.398 --> 00:19:41.236
The idea there is,
if I'm confused about a topic,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.412
somehow right in the user interface,

00:19:43.436 --> 00:19:45.572
I'd find people who are volunteering,

00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:47.334
maybe see their reputation,

00:19:47.358 --> 00:19:50.535
and I could schedule and connect up
with those people?

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:54.308
SK: Absolutely. And this is something
I recommend everyone in this audience do.

00:19:54.332 --> 00:19:57.394
Those dashboards the teachers have,
you can go log in right now

00:19:57.418 --> 00:19:59.236
and you can essentially become a coach

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.236
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.089
or maybe some kids
at the Boys and Girls Club.

00:20:05.113 --> 00:20:07.645
And yeah, you can start
becoming a mentor, a tutor,

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:09.141
really immediately.

00:20:09.165 --> 00:20:10.558
But yeah, it's all there.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.308
BG: Well, it's amazing.

00:20:12.332 --> 00:20:15.394
I think you just got a glimpse
of the future of education.

00:20:15.418 --> 00:20:17.236
BG: Thank you.
SK: Thank you.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.982
(Applause)
