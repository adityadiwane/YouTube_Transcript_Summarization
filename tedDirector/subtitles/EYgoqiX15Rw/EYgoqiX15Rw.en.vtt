00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.931
Today I'm going to unpack for you

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.661
three examples of iconic design,

00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:21.946
and it makes perfect sense

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:24.635
that I should be the one to do it

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:28.562
because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:29.908
(Laughter)

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.331
But I'm also a famous

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.392
minor television personality

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:35.462
and an avid collector of

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:37.038
Design Within Reach catalogs,

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:39.345
so I pretty much know

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.865
everything there is.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.236
Now, I'm sure you

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:43.571
recognize this object;

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:45.265
many of you probably saw it

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:46.733
as you were landing your private zeppelins

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.221
at Los Angeles International Airport

00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.414
over the past couple of days.

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:54.757
This is known as the Theme Building;

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:56.497
that is its name for reasons

00:00:56.497 --> 00:00:59.248
that are still very murky.

00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:00.669
And it is perhaps

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:03.959
the best example we have in Los Angeles

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.977
of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.

00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:11.790
It was first excavated in 1961

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.680
as they were building LAX,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.329
although scientists believe that

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.916
it dates back to the year 2000

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.981
Before Common Era,

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.322
when it was used as

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:23.697
a busy transdimensional space port

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:25.745
by the ancient astronauts

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:27.827
who first colonized this planet

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:29.337
and raised our species

00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.053
from savagery by giving us

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:32.747
the gift of written language

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:34.545
and technology and

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:37.025
the gift of revolving restaurants.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.078
It is thought to have been

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:42.700
a replacement for the older space ports

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.553
located, of course, at Stonehenge

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:46.749
and considered to be

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:47.876
quite an improvement

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.953
due to the uncluttered design,

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:52.573
the lack of druids hanging around all the time

00:01:52.573 --> 00:01:54.362
and obviously, the much better

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:56.082
access to parking.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.372
When it was uncovered,

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:00.578
it ushered in a new era

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.842
of streamlined, archaically futuristic design

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:05.271
called Googie,

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.153
which came to be synonymous with

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:09.352
the Jet Age, a misnomer.

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:12.086
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it

00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:13.924
did not travel by jet very often,

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:17.212
preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:19.868
powered by crystal skulls.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.150
(Applause)

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.736
(Music)

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:29.398
Ah yes, a table.

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:30.858
We use these every day.

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:32.604
And on top of it,

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.759
the juicy salif.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.213
This is a design by Philippe Starck,

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:38.276
who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:40.191
And you can tell it is a Starck design

00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.617
by its precision, its playfulness,

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.858
its innovation and

00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:49.110
its promise of imminent violence.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.175
(Laughter)

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.133
It is a design that challenges your intuition --

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.482
it is not what you think it is when you first see it.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:58.305
It is not a fork designed

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.679
to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time,

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.455
which would be useful out in the lobby,

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:04.624
I would say.

00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:05.893
And despite its obvious

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:07.649
influence by the ancient astronauts

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.839
and its space agey-ness and tripodism,

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.281
it is not something

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:15.412
designed to attach to your brain

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:17.589
and suck out your thoughts.

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.914
It is in fact a citrus juicer

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:21.793
and when I say that,

00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:24.585
you never see it as anything else again.

00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:28.644
It is also not a monument to design,

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:31.237
it is a monument to design's utility.

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:33.309
You can take it home with you,

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.137
unlike the Theme Building,

00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:37.698
which will stay where it is forever.

00:03:37.698 --> 00:03:39.272
This is affordable

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:40.881
and can come home with you

00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:42.941
and, as such, it can sit

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.329
on your kitchen counter --

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.435
it can't go in your drawers;

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:49.155
trust me, I found that out the hard way --

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:51.141
and make your kitchen counter into

00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.714
a monument to design.

00:03:52.714 --> 00:03:53.985
One other thing about it,

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.531
if you do have one at home,

00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:57.750
let me tell you one of the features you may not know:

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.696
when you fall asleep,

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:03.087
it comes alive

00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:05.329
and it walks around your house

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.668
and goes through your mail

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:08.918
and watches you as you sleep.

00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:13.100
(Applause)

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.704
Okay, what is this object?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:23.192
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:24.994
It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.402
I don't get it.

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:28.479
Does anyone know? Chi?

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.282
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.

00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:32.596
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those;

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:34.577
I had my whole bathroom tiles

00:04:34.577 --> 00:04:37.846
redone with those back in the good old days.

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:39.855
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.

00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:41.571
Here is my well-loved iPhone.

00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:44.615
I do so many things on this little device.

00:04:44.615 --> 00:04:46.625
I like to read books on it.

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.137
More than that, I like to buy books on it

00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:51.068
that I never have to feel guilty about not reading

00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:52.769
because they go in here and I never look at them again

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:55.715
and it's perfect.

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:57.871
I use it every day to

00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:00.306
measure the weight of an ox,

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:02.067
for example.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:03.654
Every now and then,

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:05.107
I admit that I complete

00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:07.359
a phone call on it occasionally.

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:11.057
And yet I forget about it all the time.

00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:12.839
This is a design

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.460
that once you saw it,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.702
you forgot about it.

00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:18.405
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:21.487
that occurred in 2007 when you first

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:24.257
touched this thing because it became

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:25.894
so quickly pervasive

00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:28.320
and because of how instantly

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.690
we adopted these gestures

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.685
and made it an extension of our life.

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:36.191
Unlike the Theme Building,

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.214
this is not alien technology.

00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:39.976
Or I should say,

00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:41.775
what it did was it took technology

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.207
which, unlike people in this room,

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:44.301
to many other people in the world,

00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.532
still feels very alien,

00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:47.645
and made it immediately and instantly feel

00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:49.884
familiar and intimate.

00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:52.083
And unlike the juicy salif,

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:53.715
it does not threaten

00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:55.907
to attach itself to your brain,

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.875
rather, it simply

00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.718
attaches itself to your brain.

00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:01.786
(Laughter)

00:06:01.786 --> 00:06:04.560
And you didn't even notice it happened.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.682
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:09.907
I just explained design.

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:11.718
Thank you very much.

00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:15.714
(Applause)
