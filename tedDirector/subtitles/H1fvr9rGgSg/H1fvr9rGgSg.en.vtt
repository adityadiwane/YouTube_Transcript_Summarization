00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:14.662
The following are my opinions,

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.693
and do not reflect
the opinions or policies

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:18.701
of any particular prosecutor's office.

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:20.069
(Laughter)

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:23.122
I am a prosecutor.

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:24.692
I believe in law and order.

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:28.361
I am the adopted son of a police officer,
a Marine and a hairdresser.

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:32.079
I believe in accountability

00:00:32.103 --> 00:00:35.818
and that we should all be safe
in our communities.

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:38.463
I love my job

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:39.952
and the people that do it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.474
I just think that it's our responsibility

00:00:42.498 --> 00:00:43.664
to do it better.

00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:47.262
By a show of hands,

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:50.000
how many of you, by the age of 25,

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:51.888
had either acted up in school,

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:54.651
went somewhere you were
specifically told to stay out of,

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:57.887
or drank alcohol before your legal age?

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.790
(Laughter)

00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:00.964
All right.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.759
How many of you shoplifted,

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:05.783
tried an illegal drug

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:07.486
or got into a physical fight --

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.949
yes, even with a sibling?

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.600
Now, how many of you
ever spent one day in jail

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.419
for any of those decisions?

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.443
How many of you sitting here today

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.278
think that you're a danger to society

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:28.622
or should be defined by those actions
of youthful indiscretion?

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.300
(Laughter)

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.834
Point taken.

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.809
When we talk about
criminal justice reform,

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.355
we often focus on a few things,

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:44.465
and that's what I want
to talk to you about today.

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:47.170
But first I'm going to --
since you shared with me,

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.361
I'm going to give you
a confession on my part.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:50.789
I went to law school

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:52.082
to make money.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:54.796
I had no interest
in being a public servant,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.507
I had no interest in criminal law,

00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.061
and I definitely didn't think
that I would ever be a prosecutor.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:03.894
Near the end of my first year
of law school, I got an internship

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.897
in the Roxbury Division
of Boston Municipal Court.

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.441
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished
neighborhood in Boston,

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:14.057
plagued by gun violence and drug crime.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:20.612
My life and my legal career changed
the first day of that internship.

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:25.895
I walked into a courtroom,
and I saw an auditorium of people

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.752
who, one by one, would approach
the front of that courtroom

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.512
to say two words and two words only:

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:31.686
"Not guilty."

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.611
They were predominately black and brown.

00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:38.662
And then a judge, a defense
attorney and a prosecutor

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:42.421
would make life-altering decisions
about that person without their input.

00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.281
They were predominately white.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.393
As each person, one by one,
approached the front of that courtroom,

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:51.995
I couldn't stop but think:

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.170
How did they get here?

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:54.908
I wanted to know their stories.

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:58.873
And as the prosecutor
read the facts of each case,

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.525
I was thinking to myself,

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.294
we could have predicted that.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.850
That seems so preventable...

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:09.734
not because I was an expert
in criminal law,

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:11.805
but because it was common sense.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.169
Over the course of the internship,

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:17.347
I began to recognize
people in the auditorium,

00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.463
not because they were
criminal masterminds

00:03:19.487 --> 00:03:21.487
but because they were
coming to us for help

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.711
and we were sending them out without any.

00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:29.353
My second year of law school I worked
as a paralegal for a defense attorney,

00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.666
and in that experience I met many
young men accused of murder.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.913
Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.

00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:39.518
And they all contained childhood trauma,

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.778
victimization, poverty, loss,

00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:43.500
disengagement from school,

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:46.659
early interaction with the police
and the criminal justice system,

00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:49.389
all leading to a seat in a courtroom.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.852
Those convicted of murder
were condemned to die in prison,

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:56.994
and it was during those meetings
with those men that I couldn't fathom

00:03:57.018 --> 00:03:58.805
why we would spend so much money

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.551
to keep this one person in jail
for the next 80 years

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.582
when we could have reinvested it up front,

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:07.084
and perhaps prevented the whole thing
from happening in the first place.

00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:11.242
(Applause)

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:14.060
My third year of law school,

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:16.712
I defended people accused
of small street crimes,

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:17.887
mostly mentally ill,

00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.062
mostly homeless,

00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:20.237
mostly drug-addicted,

00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.564
all in need of help.

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:24.901
They would come to us,

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.241
and we would send them away
without that help.

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:31.503
They were in need of our assistance.

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:35.014
But we weren't giving them any.

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.066
Prosecuted, adjudged and defended

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.226
by people who knew nothing about them.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:47.949
The staggering inefficiency is what
drove me to criminal justice work.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:51.326
The unfairness of it all
made me want to be a defender.

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:55.366
The power dynamic
that I came to understand

00:04:56.156 --> 00:04:57.860
made me become a prosecutor.

00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:02.314
I don't want to spend a lot of time
talking about the problem.

00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:04.678
We know the criminal justice
system needs reform,

00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:07.908
we know there are 2.3 million
people in American jails and prisons,

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.511
making us the most incarcerated
nation on the planet.

00:05:10.535 --> 00:05:13.812
We know there's another seven million
people on probation or parole,

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.050
we know that the criminal justice system

00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:18.082
disproportionately affects
people of color,

00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:19.730
particularly poor people of color.

00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:22.508
And we know there are system failures
happening everywhere

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:24.302
that bring people to our courtrooms.

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:25.588
But what we do not discuss

00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:28.294
is how ill-equipped our prosecutors
are to receive them.

00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:31.175
When we talk about
criminal justice reform,

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.506
we, as a society, focus on three things.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.342
We complain, we tweet, we protest

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:37.495
about the police, about sentencing laws

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.874
and about prison.

00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.296
We rarely, if ever, talk
about the prosecutor.

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:48.010
In the fall of 2009,

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:51.761
a young man was arrested
by the Boston Police Department.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.088
He was 18 years old,
he was African American

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:56.317
and he was a senior
at a local public school.

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:58.630
He had his sights set on college

00:05:58.654 --> 00:06:02.378
but his part-time, minimum-wage job
wasn't providing the financial opportunity

00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:03.892
he needed to enroll in school.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:06.136
In a series of bad decisions,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.765
he stole 30 laptops from a store
and sold them on the Internet.

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:11.913
This led to his arrest

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:16.193
and a criminal complaint
of 30 felony charges.

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:21.225
The potential jail time he faced is what
stressed Christopher out the most.

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.343
But what he had little understanding of

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:26.677
was the impact a criminal record
would have on his future.

00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.204
I was standing in arraignments that day

00:06:30.228 --> 00:06:32.324
when Christopher's case
came across my desk.

00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:34.864
And at the risk of sounding
dramatic, in that moment,

00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:36.839
I had Christopher's life in my hands.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:39.756
I was 29 years old,
a brand-new prosecutor,

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.876
and I had little appreciation
for how the decisions I would make

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.486
would impact Christopher's life.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.722
Christopher's case was a serious one

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:50.627
and it needed to be dealt with as such,

00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:53.690
but I didn't think branding him
a felon for the rest of his life

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:54.872
was the right answer.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.663
For the most part,
prosecutors step onto the job

00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:01.338
with little appreciation
of the impact of our decisions,

00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:02.671
regardless of our intent.

00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:04.210
Despite our broad discretion,

00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:07.406
we learn to avoid risk at all cost,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.168
rendering our discretion

00:07:09.192 --> 00:07:10.476
basically useless.

00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:14.363
History has conditioned us
to believe that somehow,

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.174
the criminal justice system
brings about accountability

00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:18.528
and improves public safety,

00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:20.259
despite evidence to the contrary.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.744
We're judged internally and externally
by our convictions and our trial wins,

00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:28.266
so prosecutors aren't really
incentivized to be creative

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.397
at our case dispositions,

00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:33.568
or to take risks on people
we might not otherwise.

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.163
We stick to an outdated method,

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:39.318
counterproductive to achieving
the very goal that we all want,

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:41.297
and that's safer communities.

00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:45.815
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space
would have arraigned Christopher.

00:07:46.897 --> 00:07:50.275
They have little appreciation
for what we can do.

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:53.409
Arraigning Christopher
would give him a criminal record,

00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:56.536
making it harder for him to get a job,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.709
setting in motion a cycle

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:01.589
that defines the failing
criminal justice system today.

00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:06.058
With a criminal record and without a job,

00:08:06.082 --> 00:08:10.603
Christopher would be unable to find
employment, education or stable housing.

00:08:10.627 --> 00:08:12.746
Without those protective
factors in his life,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.140
Christopher would be more likely
to commit further, more serious crime.

00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:19.289
The more contact Christopher had
with the criminal justice system,

00:08:19.313 --> 00:08:21.857
the more likely it would be
that he would return again

00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:23.850
and again and again --

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:27.678
all at tremendous social cost
to his children, to his family

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:28.853
and to his peers.

00:08:28.877 --> 00:08:30.182
And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:33.681
it is a terrible public safety
outcome for the rest of us.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:38.784
When I came out of law school,

00:08:38.808 --> 00:08:41.014
I did the same thing as everybody else.

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:44.002
I came out as a prosecutor
expected to do justice,

00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:46.529
but I never learned what
justice was in my classes --

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:47.703
none of us do.

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:49.353
None of us do.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.447
And yet, prosecutors
are the most powerful actors

00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.081
in the criminal justice system.

00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:57.922
Our power is virtually boundless.

00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:59.399
In most cases, not the judge,

00:08:59.423 --> 00:09:01.153
not the police, not the legislature,

00:09:01.177 --> 00:09:03.550
not the mayor, not the governor,
not the President

00:09:03.574 --> 00:09:05.510
can tell us how to prosecute our cases.

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:10.122
The decision to arraign Christopher
and give him a criminal record

00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:11.375
was exclusively mine.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.829
I would choose whether to prosecute
him for 30 felonies, for one felony,

00:09:15.853 --> 00:09:17.004
for a misdemeanor,

00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:18.205
or at all.

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:21.205
I would choose whether to leverage
Christopher into a plea deal

00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:23.258
or take the case to trial, and ultimately,

00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:26.273
I would be in a position to ask
for Christopher to go to jail.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.589
These are decisions that prosecutors
make every day unfettered,

00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:35.422
and we are unaware and untrained

00:09:35.446 --> 00:09:38.360
of the grave consequences
of those decisions.

00:09:40.498 --> 00:09:41.820
One night this past summer,

00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:45.746
I was at a small gathering
of professional men of color

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.357
from around the city.

00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:50.338
As I stood there stuffing
free finger sandwiches into my mouth,

00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:51.845
as you do as public servant --

00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:52.885
(Laughter)

00:09:52.909 --> 00:09:54.472
I noticed across the room,

00:09:54.496 --> 00:09:58.295
a young man waving and smiling
at me and approaching me.

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:02.551
And I recognized him,
but I couldn't place from where,

00:10:02.575 --> 00:10:06.163
and before I knew it,
this young man was hugging me.

00:10:07.134 --> 00:10:08.521
And thanking me.

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:12.067
"You cared about me,
and you changed my life."

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:14.829
It was Christopher.

00:10:15.836 --> 00:10:17.522
See, I never arraigned Christopher.

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:19.146
He never faced a judge or a jail,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.749
he never had a criminal record.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.891
Instead, I worked with Christopher;

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:25.634
first on being accountable
for his actions,

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.747
and then, putting him in a position
where he wouldn't re-offend.

00:10:29.665 --> 00:10:32.618
We recovered 75 percent
of the computers that he sold

00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:34.145
and gave them back to Best Buy,

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:35.773
and came up with a financial plan

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:38.012
to repay for the computers
we couldn't recover.

00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:39.751
Christopher did community service.

00:10:39.775 --> 00:10:43.054
He wrote an essay reflecting on how
this case could impact his future

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:44.429
and that of the community.

00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:45.660
He applied to college,

00:10:45.684 --> 00:10:46.944
he obtained financial aid,

00:10:46.968 --> 00:10:49.529
and he went on to graduate
from a four-year school.

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:57.007
(Applause)

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.014
After we finished hugging,
I looked at his name tag,

00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:03.287
to learn that Christopher was the manager
of a large bank in Boston.

00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:06.611
Christopher had accomplished --
and making a lot more money than me --

00:11:06.635 --> 00:11:07.636
(Laughter)

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.166
He had accomplished all of this

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.285
in the six years since I had first
seen him in Roxbury Court.

00:11:12.909 --> 00:11:15.976
I can't take credit for Christopher's
journey to success,

00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:19.889
but I certainly did my part
to keep him on the path.

00:11:20.992 --> 00:11:24.071
There are thousands
of Christophers out there,

00:11:24.593 --> 00:11:26.374
some locked in our jails and prisons.

00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:28.263
We need thousands of prosecutors

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:31.111
to recognize that and to protect them.

00:11:32.508 --> 00:11:36.024
An employed Christopher is better
for public safety than a condemned one.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:39.105
It's a bigger win for all of us.

00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:43.519
In retrospect, the decision not
to throw the book at Christopher

00:11:43.543 --> 00:11:44.694
makes perfect sense.

00:11:44.718 --> 00:11:46.930
When I saw him that first day
in Roxbury Court,

00:11:46.954 --> 00:11:48.826
I didn't see a criminal standing there.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.645
I saw myself -- a young person
in need of intervention.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:55.982
As an individual caught selling a large
quantity of drugs in my late teens,

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.931
I knew firsthand the power of opportunity

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:01.841
as opposed to the wrath
of the criminal justice system.

00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:08.252
Along the way, with the help
and guidance of my district attorney,

00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:11.249
my supervisor and judges,

00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.800
I learned the power of the prosecutor

00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:16.546
to change lives instead of ruining them.

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.179
And that's how we do it in Boston.

00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:24.751
We helped a woman who was arrested
for stealing groceries to feed her kids

00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:25.925
get a job.

00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:29.549
Instead of putting an abused
teenager in adult jail

00:12:29.573 --> 00:12:31.026
for punching another teenager,

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.940
we secured mental health treatment
and community supervision.

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:35.935
A runaway girl who was arrested

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.062
for prostituting, to survive
on the streets,

00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:40.827
needed a safe place to live and grow --

00:12:40.851 --> 00:12:42.854
something we could help her with.

00:12:42.878 --> 00:12:44.354
I even helped a young man

00:12:44.378 --> 00:12:47.481
who was so afraid of the older gang kids
showing up after school,

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:50.180
that one morning instead
of a lunchbox into his backpack,

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:51.829
he put a loaded 9-millimeter.

00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:57.503
We would spend our time that we'd
normally take prepping our cases

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.694
for months and months
for trial down the road

00:12:59.718 --> 00:13:03.619
by coming up with real solutions
to the problems as they presented.

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:06.985
Which is the better way to spend our time?

00:13:07.969 --> 00:13:10.703
How would you prefer
your prosecutors to spend theirs?

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:14.269
Why are we spending 80 billion dollars

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.735
on a prison industry
that we know is failing,

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.323
when we could take that money
and reallocate it into education,

00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:21.756
into mental health treatment,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.277
into substance abuse treatment

00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:26.359
and to community investment
so we can develop our neighborhoods?

00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:32.899
(Applause)

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:35.220
So why should this matter to you?

00:13:35.244 --> 00:13:38.362
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:40.531
Our money.

00:13:41.063 --> 00:13:43.469
It costs 109,000 dollars in some states

00:13:43.493 --> 00:13:45.083
to lock up a teenager for a year,

00:13:45.107 --> 00:13:49.559
with a 60 percent chance that that person
will return to the very same system.

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:53.006
That is a terrible return on investment.

00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:56.980
Number two: it's the right thing to do.

00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:59.959
If prosecutors were a part
of creating the problem,

00:13:59.983 --> 00:14:02.212
it's incumbent on us to create a solution

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:04.283
and we can do that using other disciplines

00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:06.823
that have already done the data
and research for us.

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.016
And number three:

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.641
your voice and your vote
can make that happen.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:13.345
The next time there's a local
district attorney's election

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:14.521
in your jurisdiction,

00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:16.039
ask candidates these questions.

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:19.250
One: What are you doing to make
me and my neighbors safer?

00:14:19.274 --> 00:14:21.654
Two: What data are you collecting,

00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:23.899
and how are you training your prosecutors

00:14:23.923 --> 00:14:25.594
to make sure that it's working?

00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:26.783
And number three:

00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:28.663
If it's not working for everybody,

00:14:28.687 --> 00:14:30.241
what are you doing to fix it?

00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:32.274
If they can't answer the questions,

00:14:32.298 --> 00:14:34.185
they shouldn't be doing the job.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.697
Each one of you that raised your hand
at the beginning of this talk

00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:42.159
is a living, breathing example
of the power of opportunity,

00:14:42.183 --> 00:14:43.334
of intervention,

00:14:43.358 --> 00:14:44.509
of support

00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:45.814
and of love.

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:48.739
While each of you may have faced
your own brand of discipline

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.876
for whatever malfeasances you committed,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.765
barely any of you needed a day in jail

00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:54.868
to make you the people
that you are today --

00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:56.954
some of the greatest minds on the planet.

00:14:57.748 --> 00:14:59.627
Every day, thousands of times a day,

00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:02.597
prosecutors around the United States
wield power so great

00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:04.361
that it can bring about catastrophe

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:06.963
as quickly as it can
bring about opportunity,

00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:08.219
intervention,

00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:09.402
support

00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:11.544
and yes, even love.

00:15:12.758 --> 00:15:15.664
Those qualities are the hallmarks
of a strong community,

00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.482
and a strong community is a safe one.

00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:18.962
If our communities are broken,

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.083
don't let the lawyers
that you elect fix them

00:15:21.107 --> 00:15:23.290
with outdated, inefficient,
expensive methods.

00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:26.957
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor
who's helping people stay out of jail,

00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:28.133
not putting them in.

00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:29.308
Demand better.

00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:31.338
You deserve it, your children deserve it,

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:33.800
the people who are tied up
in the system deserve it,

00:15:33.824 --> 00:15:34.976
but most of all,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.247
the people that we are sworn to protect
and do justice for demand it.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.422
We must,

00:15:39.446 --> 00:15:40.828
we must do better.

00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:42.009
Thank you.

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:44.010
(Applause)

00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:47.988
Thank you.

00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:50.218
(Applause)

00:15:51.213 --> 00:15:53.489
Thank you very much.
