00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:42.260
(Music)

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Applause)

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Thank you.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
Imagining a solo cello concert,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
unaccompanied cello suites.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
As a child

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
studying these eternal masterpieces,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Bach's music would intermingle

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
with the singing voices of Muslim prayers

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
from the neighboring Arab village

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
of the northern Kibbutz in Israel

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
where I grew up.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Late at night, after hours of practicing,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
as the sounds of tango music

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
would be creeping from my parents' stereo.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
It all became music to me.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
I didn't hear the boundaries.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I still start every day

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
practicing playing Bach.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
His music never ceases

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to sound fresh and surprising to me.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
But as I was moving away

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
from the traditional classical repertoire

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and trying to find new ways

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
of musical expression,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I realized that with today's technological resources,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
there's no reason to limit

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
what can be produced at one time

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
from a single string instrument.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
The power and coherency

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.260
that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
makes a very different experience.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
The excitement of a great orchestra performance

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
producing one unified whole concept.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
The excitement from using multi-tracking,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
the way I did in the piece you will hear next,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
comes from the attempt

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
to build and create a whole universe

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
with many diverse layers,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
all generated from a single source.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
My cello and my voice are layered

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
to create this large sonic canvas.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
When composers write music for me,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
I hope to arrive at new territories

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to discover sounds I have never heard before.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I want to create endless possibilities

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
with this cello.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and in the process, when all is right,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
the music is transformed

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and so am I.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:59.260
(Music)

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:23.260
(Applause)
