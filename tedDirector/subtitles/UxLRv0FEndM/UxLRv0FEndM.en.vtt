00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:15.918
Hi. I'm going to talk 
to you today about laughter,

00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:18.707
and I just want to start 
by thinking about the first time

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.736
I can ever remember noticing laughter.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.558
This is when I was a little girl.
I would've been about six.

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:27.113
And I came across my parents
doing something unusual,

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:28.619
where they were laughing.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.686
They were laughing very, very hard.

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:32.590
They were lying on the floor laughing.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.540
They were screaming with laughter.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.767
I did not know what they were 
laughing at, but I wanted in.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.471
I wanted to be part of that,

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.570
and I kind of sat around at the edge
going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.009
Now, incidentally,
what they were laughing at

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.609
was a song which people used to sing,

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.255
which was based around
signs in toilets on trains

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.250
telling you what you could
and could not do

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.690
in toilets on trains.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.893
And the thing you have to remember
about the English is, of course,

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:03.616
we do have an immensely
sophisticated sense of humor.

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:04.775
(Laughter)

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:07.508
At the time, though, I didn't
understand anything of that.

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:09.067
I just cared about the laughter,

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.419
and actually, as a neuroscientist,
I've come to care about it again.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:15.176
And it is a really weird thing to do.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:17.593
What I'm going to do now
is just play some examples

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:19.144
of real human beings laughing,

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:22.627
and I want you think about the sound
people make and how odd that can be,

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:25.204
and in fact how primitive
laughter is as a sound.

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:28.013
It's much more like an animal call
than it is like speech.

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:31.487
So here we've got some laughter for you.
The first one is pretty joyful.

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:45.142
(Audio: Laughing)

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:50.081
Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:52.233
There's a point in there
where I'm just, like,

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:54.255
you've got to get some air in there, mate,

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:56.460
because he just sounds
like he's breathing out.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.187
(Audio: Laughing)

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:08.182
This hasn't been edited; this is him.

00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:14.544
(Audio: Laughing)
(Laughter)

00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:18.283
And finally we have -- 
this is a human female laughing.

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:22.346
And laughter can take us to some pretty
odd places in terms of making noises.

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:31.135
(Audio: Laughing)

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.613
She actually says, "Oh my God,
what is that?" in French.

00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:48.179
We're all kind of with her.
I have no idea.

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.606
Now, to understand laughter,
you have to look at a part of the body

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:55.430
that psychologists and neuroscientists
don't normally spend much time looking at,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.495
which is the ribcage,

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:58.311
and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.990
but actually you're all using 
your ribcage all the time.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.573
What you're all doing 
at the moment with your ribcage,

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:05.413
and don't stop doing it, is breathing.

00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:08.563
So you use the intercostal muscles,
the muscles between your ribs,

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.340
to bring air in and out of your lungs

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.530
just by expanding
and contracting your ribcage,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.408
and if I was to put a strap 
around the outside of your chest

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.978
called a breath belt, and just look 
at that movement,

00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:21.132
you see a rather gentle sinusoidal
movement, so that's breathing.

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:22.710
You're all doing it. Don't stop.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.104
As soon as you start talking,

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.731
you start using your breathing
completely differently.

00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:29.678
So what I'm doing now is you see
something much more like this.

00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:32.271
In talking, you use very fine
movements of the ribcage

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:33.651
to squeeze the air out --

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:36.140
and in fact, we're the only animals
that can do this.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.681
It's why we can talk at all.

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.843
Now, both talking and breathing
has a mortal enemy,

00:03:40.843 --> 00:03:43.209
and that enemy is laughter,

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.658
because what happens when you laugh

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.959
is those same muscles
start to contract very regularly,

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.377
and you get this very marked
sort of zig-zagging,

00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:53.560
and that's just squeezing
the air out of you.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.027
It literally is that basic a way
of making a sound.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.023
You could be stamping on somebody,
it's having the same effect.

00:03:59.023 --> 00:04:00.507
You're just squeezing air out,

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.340
and each of those contractions --
Ha! -- gives you a sound.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.303
And as the contractions run together,
you can get these spasms,

00:04:06.303 --> 00:04:10.083
and that's when you start getting
these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.577
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:17.802
Now, in terms of the science of laughter,
there isn't very much,

00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:20.850
but it does turn out that pretty much
everything we think we know

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.042
about laughter is wrong.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.998
So it's not at all unusual, for example,
to hear people to say

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:28.001
humans are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.934
Nietzsche thought that humans
are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:33.387
In fact, you find laughter
throughout the mammals.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:35.973
It's been well-described
and well-observed in primates,

00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:37.377
but you also see it in rats,

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.683
and wherever you find it --

00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:40.789
humans, primates, rats --

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.808
you find it associated
with things like tickling.

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:46.896
That's the same for humans.

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:51.563
You find it associated with play,
and all mammals play.

00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:55.557
And wherever you find it,
it's associated with interactions.

00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:58.147
So Robert Provine, who has done
a lot of work on this,

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:02.987
has pointed out that you are 30 times 
more likely to laugh

00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:06.353
if you are with somebody else
than if you're on your own,

00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:08.257
and where you find most laughter

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:10.984
is in social interactions
like conversation.

00:05:10.984 --> 00:05:13.226
So if you ask human beings,
"When do you laugh?"

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:17.177
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk
about humor and they'll talk about jokes.

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:20.376
If you look at when they laugh,
they're laughing with their friends.

00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:23.963
And when we laugh with people, we're
hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.

00:05:23.963 --> 00:05:26.626
You are laughing to show people
that you understand them,

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.874
that you agree with them, that you're
part of the same group as them.

00:05:29.874 --> 00:05:31.873
You're laughing to show
that you like them.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.078
You might even love them.

00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:35.788
You're doing all that at the same time
as talking to them,

00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:38.808
and the laughter is doing a lot
of that emotional work for you.

00:05:38.808 --> 00:05:41.986
Something that Robert Provine
has pointed out, as you can see here,

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:43.665
and the reason why we were laughing

00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:45.806
when we heard those
funny laughs at the start,

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:48.511
and why I was laughing
when I found my parents laughing,

00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.346
is that it's an enormously
behaviorally contagious effect.

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:53.440
You can catch laughter from somebody else,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.099
and you are more likely to catch laughter
off somebody else if you know them.

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.358
So it's still modulated
by this social context.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:00.946
You have to put humor to one side

00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:03.167
and think about the social 
meaning of laughter

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.255
because that's where its origins lie.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:09.435
Now, something I've got very interested in
is different kinds of laughter,

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:14.148
and we have some neurobiological evidence
about how human beings vocalize

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:18.281
that suggests there might be
two kinds of laughs that we have.

00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:23.227
So it seems possible that the neurobiology
for helpless, involuntary laughter,

00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:26.431
like my parents lying on the floor
screaming about a silly song,

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:29.465
might have a different basis to it
than some of that more polite

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:32.631
social laughter that you encounter,
which isn't horrible laughter,

00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:36.949
but it's behavior somebody is doing
as part of their communicative act to you,

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.050
part of their interaction with you;
they are choosing to do this.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.439
In our evolution, we have developed
two different ways of vocalizing.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.356
Involuntary vocalizations
are part of an older system

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.559
than the more voluntary vocalizations
like the speech I'm doing now.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.040
So we might imagine that laughter
might actually have two different roots.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.088
So I've been looking at this
in more detail.

00:06:55.088 --> 00:06:58.311
To do this, we've had to make
recordings of people laughing,

00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.088
and we've had to do whatever it takes
to make people laugh,

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:04.297
and we got those same people
to produce more posed, social laughter.

00:07:04.297 --> 00:07:05.965
So imagine your friend told a joke,

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:08.253
and you're laughing because
you like your friend,

00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:10.261
but not really because
the joke's all that.

00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:12.354
So I'm going to play you 
a couple of those.

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:15.507
I want you to tell me if you think
this laughter is real laughter,

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:16.806
or if you think it's posed.

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:19.742
So is this involuntary laughter
or more voluntary laughter?

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:24.622
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:26.237
What does that sound like to you?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.310
Audience: Posed.
Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.819
How about this one?

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:34.370
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.802
(Laughter)

00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:37.218
I'm the best.

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:39.857
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:41.593
Not really.

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.843
No, that was helpless laughter,

00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:47.118
and in fact, to record that,
all they had to do was record me

00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:50.895
watching one of my friends listening to
something I knew she wanted to laugh at,

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:52.365
and I just started doing this.

00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:55.582
What you find is that people
are good at telling the difference

00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:57.127
between real and posed laughter.

00:07:57.127 --> 00:07:59.041
They seem to be different things to us.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:02.073
Interestingly, you see something
quite similar with chimpanzees.

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:04.621
Chimpanzees laugh differently
if they're being tickled

00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:06.590
than if they're playing with each other,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.852
and we might be seeing
something like that here,

00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:12.546
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
being different from social laughter.

00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:14.287
They're acoustically very different.

00:08:14.287 --> 00:08:16.779
The real laughs are longer.
They're higher in pitch.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.198
When you start laughing hard,

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.251
you start squeezing air out
from your lungs

00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:23.442
under much higher pressures
than you could ever produce voluntarily.

00:08:23.442 --> 00:08:26.364
For example, I could never
pitch my voice that high to sing.

00:08:26.364 --> 00:08:30.032
Also, you start to get these sort of
contractions and weird whistling sounds,

00:08:30.032 --> 00:08:32.798
all of which mean that real laughter
is extremely easy,

00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:34.870
or feels extremely easy to spot.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.952
In contrast, posed laughter,
we might think it sounds a bit fake.

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:42.692
Actually, it's not, it's actually
an important social cue.

00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:45.769
We use it a lot, we're choosing
to laugh in a lot of situations,

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:47.382
and it seems to be its own thing.

00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:50.169
So, for example, you find
nasality in posed laughter,

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:52.276
that kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:55.723
that you never get, you could not do,
if you were laughing involuntarily.

00:08:55.723 --> 00:08:58.955
So they do seem to be genuinely
these two different sorts of things.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.505
We took it into the scanner
to see how brains respond

00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:02.717
when you hear laughter.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:05.385
And when you do this,
this is a really boring experiment.

00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:07.430
We just played people
real and posed laughs.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.634
We didn't tell them
it was a study on laughter.

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:11.833
We put other sounds in there 
to distract them,

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.220
and all they're doing
is lying listening to sounds.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.863
We don't tell them to do anything.

00:09:15.863 --> 00:09:19.337
Nonetheless, when you hear real laughter
and when you hear posed laughter,

00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:21.754
the brains are responding
completely differently,

00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:23.186
significantly differently.

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:26.734
What you see in the regions in blue,
which lies in auditory cortex,

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:29.423
are the brain areas that respond
more to the real laughs,

00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:30.864
and what seems to be the case,

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:33.021
when you hear somebody
laughing involuntarily,

00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:35.748
you hear sounds you would never
hear in any other context.

00:09:35.748 --> 00:09:36.834
It's very unambiguous,

00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:39.904
and it seems to be associated
with greater auditory processing

00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:41.274
of these novel sounds.

00:09:41.274 --> 00:09:45.083
In contrast, when you hear somebody
laughing in a posed way,

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:47.125
what you see are these regions in pink,

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:50.004
which are occupying brain areas
associated with mentalizing,

00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:52.159
thinking about what
somebody else is thinking.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.699
And I think what that means is,

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:56.896
even if you're having your brain scanned,
which is completely boring

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.096
and not very interesting,

00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.429
when you hear somebody going,
"A ha ha ha ha ha,"

00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:02.625
you're trying to work out
why they're laughing.

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:04.070
Laughter is always meaningful.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.410
You are always trying
to understand it in context,

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.276
even if, as far as you are concerned,
at that point in time,

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.463
it has not necessarily
anything to do with you,

00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:14.135
you still want to know
why those people are laughing.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:18.001
Now, we've had the opportunity to look 
at how people hear real and posed laughter

00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.064
across the age range.

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:21.995
So this is an online experiment
we ran with the Royal Society,

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:24.099
and here we just asked people
two questions.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:25.927
First of all, they heard some laughs,

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:28.946
and they had to say, how real 
or posed do these laughs sound?

00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:32.403
The real laughs are shown in red
and the posed laughs are shown in blue.

00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:34.300
What you see is there is a rapid onset.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.652
As you get older, you get better
and better at spotting real laughter.

00:10:37.652 --> 00:10:40.977
So six-year-olds are at chance,
they can't really hear the difference.

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:43.129
By the time you are older, you get better,

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:46.751
but interestingly, you do not hit
peak performance in this dataset

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:50.282
until you are in your
late 30s and early 40s.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:53.323
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time you hit puberty.

00:10:53.323 --> 00:10:56.620
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time your brain has matured

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.014
at the end of your teens.

00:10:58.014 --> 00:11:01.812
You're learning about laughter
throughout your entire early adult life.

00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:05.614
If we turn the question around and now say
not, what does the laughter sound like

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:07.666
in terms of being real
or posed, but we say,

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.150
how much does this laughter
make you want to laugh,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.365
how contagious is this laughter to you,
we see a different profile.

00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:14.868
And here, the younger you are,

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:17.302
the more you want to join in
when you hear laughter.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.795
Remember me laughing with my parents
when I had no idea what was going on.

00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:22.021
You really can see this.

00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:23.416
Now everybody, young and old,

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:26.261
finds the real laughs more contagious
than the posed laughs,

00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:29.171
but as you get older, it all becomes 
less contagious to you.

00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:33.375
Now, either we're all just becoming
really grumpy as we get older,

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:36.304
or it may mean that as you
understand laughter better,

00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.393
and you are getting better at doing that,

00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:41.339
you need more than just
hearing people laugh to want to laugh.

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:43.986
You need the social stuff there.

00:11:43.986 --> 00:11:45.960
So we've got a very interesting behavior

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.113
about which a lot of our
lay assumptions are incorrect,

00:11:49.113 --> 00:11:52.964
but I'm coming to see that actually
there's even more to laughter

00:11:52.964 --> 00:11:55.695
than it's an important social emotion
we should look at,

00:11:55.695 --> 00:11:58.614
because it turns out
people are phenomenally nuanced

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:00.201
in terms of how we use laughter.

00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:02.485
There's a really lovely
set of studies coming out

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.579
from Robert Levenson's lab in California,

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:07.055
where he's doing
a longitudinal study with couples.

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:09.838
He gets married couples,
men and women, into the lab,

00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:12.132
and he gives them
stressful conversations to have

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:15.664
while he wires them up to a polygraph
so he can see them becoming stressed.

00:12:15.664 --> 00:12:18.899
So you've got the two of them in there,
and he'll say to the husband,

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:21.681
"Tell me something that your wife does
that irritates you."

00:12:21.681 --> 00:12:23.297
And what you see is immediately --

00:12:23.297 --> 00:12:26.624
just run that one through your head
briefly, you and your partner --

00:12:26.624 --> 00:12:30.772
you can imagine everybody gets a bit
more stressed as soon as that starts.

00:12:30.772 --> 00:12:33.396
You can see physically,
people become more stressed.

00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:39.178
What he finds is that the couples
who manage that feeling of stress

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:42.684
with laughter,
positive emotions like laughter,

00:12:42.684 --> 00:12:46.492
not only immediately become less stressed,

00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:48.906
they can see them
physically feeling better,

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:52.064
they're dealing with this
unpleasant situation better together,

00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:53.885
they are also the couples that report

00:12:53.885 --> 00:12:56.244
high levels of satisfaction
in their relationship

00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:57.915
and they stay together for longer.

00:12:57.915 --> 00:13:00.236
So in fact, when you look
at close relationships,

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:02.134
laughter is a phenomenally useful index

00:13:02.134 --> 00:13:04.607
of how people are regulating
their emotions together.

00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:08.032
We're not just emitting it at each other
to show that we like each other,

00:13:08.032 --> 00:13:10.087
we're making ourselves
feel better together.

00:13:10.087 --> 00:13:13.538
Now, I don't think this is going
to be limited to romantic relationships.

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:16.011
I think this is probably
going to be a characteristic

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:19.329
of close emotional relationships
such as you might have with friends,

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:21.158
which explains my next clip,

00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:24.803
which is of a YouTube video of some
young men in the former East Germany

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:28.309
on making a video to promote
their heavy metal band,

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:31.211
and it's extremely macho,
and the mood is very serious,

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.323
and I want you to notice
what happens in terms of laughter

00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:36.273
when things go wrong

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:40.125
and how quickly that happens,
and how that changes the mood.

00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:44.911
He's cold. He's about to get wet.
He's got swimming trunks on,

00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:48.649
got a towel.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:50.321
Ice.

00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.759
What might possibly happen?

00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:56.172
Video starts.

00:13:57.663 --> 00:13:59.562
Serious mood.

00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:11.249
And his friends are already laughing.
They are already laughing, hard.

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:13.153
He's not laughing yet.

00:14:14.863 --> 00:14:16.512
(Laughter)

00:14:16.512 --> 00:14:18.723
He's starting to go now.

00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:27.518
And now they're all off.

00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:32.556
(Laughter)

00:14:44.653 --> 00:14:46.395
They're on the floor.

00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:50.017
(Laughter)

00:14:55.727 --> 00:14:59.039
The thing I really like about that
is it's all very serious

00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:02.764
until he jumps onto the ice, and
as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,

00:15:02.764 --> 00:15:05.027
but also there isn't blood
and bone everywhere,

00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:06.600
his friends start laughing.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.992
And imagine if that had played him out
with him standing there going,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.436
"No seriously, Heinrich,
I think this is broken,"

00:15:12.436 --> 00:15:15.186
we wouldn't enjoy watching that.
That would be stressful.

00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:18.179
Or if he was running around
with a visibly broken leg laughing,

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:22.010
and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I
think we need to go to the hospital now,"

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.407
that also wouldn't be funny.

00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:25.069
The fact that the laughter works,

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:28.031
it gets him from a painful,
embarrassing, difficult situation,

00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:31.116
into a funny situation, into what we're 
actually enjoying there,

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.303
and I think that's 
a really interesting use,

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:35.281
and it's actually happening all the time.

00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:37.972
For example, I can remember
something like this happening

00:15:37.972 --> 00:15:39.169
at my father's funeral.

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:41.784
We weren't jumping around
on the ice in our underpants.

00:15:41.784 --> 00:15:44.425
We're not Canadian.

00:15:44.425 --> 00:15:46.880
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:15:46.924 --> 00:15:50.807
These events are always difficult, I had
a relative who was being a bit difficult,

00:15:50.807 --> 00:15:52.337
my mum was not in a good place,

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:55.621
and I can remember finding myself
just before the whole thing started

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.868
telling this story about something
that happened in a 1970s sitcom,

00:15:59.868 --> 00:16:02.306
and I just thought at the time,
I don't know why I'm doing this,

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:04.484
and what I realized I was doing

00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:07.182
was I was coming up with
something from somewhere

00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:11.571
I could use to make her laugh
together with me.

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.884
It was a very basic reaction
to find some reason we can do this.

00:16:14.884 --> 00:16:17.569
We can laugh together.
We're going to get through this.

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:19.065
We're going to be okay.

00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:21.496
And in fact, all of us
are doing this all the time.

00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:23.686
You do it so often,
you don't even notice it.

00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:26.101
Everybody underestimates
how often they laugh,

00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:29.119
and you're doing something,
when you laugh with people,

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:33.949
that's actually letting you access
a really ancient evolutionary system

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.756
that mammals have evolved
to make and maintain social bonds,

00:16:37.756 --> 00:16:41.146
and clearly to regulate emotions,
to make ourselves feel better.

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:44.536
It's not something specific to humans --
it's a really ancient behavior

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:48.600
which really helps us regulate how we feel
and makes us feel better.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.502
In other words, when it comes to laughter,

00:16:51.502 --> 00:16:54.172
you and me, baby, ain't nothing 
but mammals. (Laughter)

00:16:54.172 --> 00:16:56.517
Thank you.

00:16:56.517 --> 00:17:03.763
Thank you. (Applause)
