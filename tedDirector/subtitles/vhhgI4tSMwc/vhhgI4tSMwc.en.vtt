00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.460
When I was in my 20s,

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:17.928
I saw my very first psychotherapy client.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.884
I was a Ph.D. student
in clinical psychology at Berkeley.

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:25.474
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.

00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:30.929
Now Alex walked into her first session
wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,

00:00:30.953 --> 00:00:33.040
and she dropped
onto the couch in my office

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:34.733
and kicked off her flats

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:37.985
and told me she was there
to talk about guy problems.

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:42.548
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.

00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.092
My classmate got an arsonist
for her first client.

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:47.962
(Laughter)

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:52.083
And I got a twentysomething
who wanted to talk about boys.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:54.621
This I thought I could handle.

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:56.693
But I didn't handle it.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:00.203
With the funny stories
that Alex would bring to session,

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.202
it was easy for me just to nod my head

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.392
while we kicked the can down the road.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:06.672
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:09.258
and as far as I could tell, she was right.

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:11.952
Work happened later,
marriage happened later,

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:15.418
kids happened later,
even death happened later.

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.700
Twentysomethings like Alex and I
had nothing but time.

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:26.390
But before long, my supervisor pushed me
to push Alex about her love life.

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:27.559
I pushed back.

00:01:28.186 --> 00:01:30.677
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.012
she's sleeping with a knucklehead,

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:35.646
but it's not like she's going
to marry the guy."

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:38.251
And then my supervisor said,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:42.101
"Not yet, but she might marry
the next one.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:46.483
Besides, the best time
to work on Alex's marriage

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.241
is before she has one."

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.250
That's what psychologists
call an "Aha!" moment.

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:56.384
That was the moment I realized,
30 is not the new 20.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.175
Yes, people settle down later
than they used to,

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:03.574
but that didn't make Alex's 20s
a developmental downtime.

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:07.086
That made Alex's 20s
a developmental sweet spot,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.714
and we were sitting there, blowing it.

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:14.168
That was when I realized
that this sort of benign neglect

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:18.165
was a real problem,
and it had real consequences,

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.579
not just for Alex and her love life

00:02:20.603 --> 00:02:23.730
but for the careers
and the families and the futures

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:25.818
of twentysomethings everywhere.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:31.469
There are 50 million twentysomethings
in the United States right now.

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:35.706
We're talking about 15 percent
of the population,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.998
or 100 percent if you consider

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:42.565
that no one's getting through adulthood
without going through their 20s first.

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.688
(Laughter)

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:45.758
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.068
I really want to see
some twentysomethings here.

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:49.597
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.542
If you work with twentysomethings,
you love a twentysomething,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:56.410
you're losing sleep
over twentysomethings, I want to see —

00:02:56.434 --> 00:03:00.284
Okay. Awesome,
twentysomethings really matter.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.589
So, I specialize in twentysomethings
because I believe

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:08.487
that every single one of those
50 million twentysomethings

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:11.716
deserves to know what psychologists,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.436
sociologists, neurologists
and fertility specialists

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.254
already know:

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:20.444
that claiming your 20s
is one of the simplest,

00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:23.223
yet most transformative, things you can do

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:25.918
for work, for love, for your happiness,

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:27.707
maybe even for the world.

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:30.453
This is not my opinion.

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.047
These are the facts.

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:36.416
We know that 80 percent
of life's most defining moments

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.821
take place by age 35.

00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:42.015
That means that eight out of 10

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.334
of the decisions and experiences
and "Aha!" moments

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.478
that make your life what it is

00:03:47.502 --> 00:03:49.792
will have happened by your mid-30s.

00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:52.705
People who are over 40, don't panic.

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.990
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.140
We know that the first
10 years of a career

00:03:58.164 --> 00:04:02.772
has an exponential impact
on how much money you're going to earn.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:04.908
We know that more than half of Americans

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:09.078
are married or are living with or dating
their future partner by 30.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.722
We know that the brain caps off

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:14.746
its second and last
growth spurt in your 20s

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.616
as it rewires itself for adulthood,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.693
which means that whatever it is you want
to change about yourself,

00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:23.724
now is the time to change it.

00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:27.758
We know that personality
changes more during your 20s

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:30.464
than at any other time in life,

00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:34.330
and we know that female fertility
peaks at age 28,

00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:37.526
and things get tricky after age 35.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.838
So your 20s are the time
to educate yourself

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:43.853
about your body and your options.

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.702
So when we think about child development,

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:50.667
we all know that the first
five years are a critical period

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:53.514
for language and attachment in the brain.

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:57.203
It's a time when your ordinary,
day-to-day life

00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:00.890
has an inordinate impact
on who you will become.

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:04.771
But what we hear less about
is that there's such a thing

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:05.952
as adult development,

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:10.290
and our 20s are that critical period
of adult development.

00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:14.314
But this isn't what
twentysomethings are hearing.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.592
Newspapers talk about the changing
timetable of adulthood.

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:22.321
Researchers call the 20s
an extended adolescence.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:25.549
Journalists coin silly nicknames
for twentysomethings

00:05:25.573 --> 00:05:27.558
like "twixters" and "kidults."

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:30.781
(Laughing) It's true!

00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:33.250
As a culture, we have trivialized

00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:37.786
what is actually
the defining decade of adulthood.

00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:42.091
Leonard Bernstein said
that to achieve great things,

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.227
you need a plan and not quite enough time.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.303
(Laughing) Isn't that true?

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:49.909
So what do you think happens

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.553
when you pat a twentysomething
on the head and you say,

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:54.834
"You have 10 extra years
to start your life"?

00:05:56.013 --> 00:05:57.633
Nothing happens.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.655
You have robbed that person
of his urgency and ambition,

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.903
and absolutely nothing happens.

00:06:04.657 --> 00:06:08.245
And then every day, smart,
interesting twentysomethings

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:11.503
like you or like your sons and daughters

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:14.869
come into my office
and say things like this:

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:18.266
"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.540
but this relationship doesn't count.
I'm just killing time."

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.735
Or they say, "Everybody says
as long as I get started

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.187
on a career by the time
I'm 30, I'll be fine."

00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:31.633
But then it starts to sound like this:

00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:36.093
"My 20s are almost over,
and I have nothing to show for myself.

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:40.157
I had a better résumé the day
after I graduated from college."

00:06:41.424 --> 00:06:43.448
And then it starts to sound like this:

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.952
"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:49.821
Everybody was running around
and having fun,

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:52.701
but then sometime around 30
it was like the music turned off

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:54.608
and everybody started sitting down.

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:57.584
I didn't want to be
the only one left standing up,

00:06:57.608 --> 00:06:59.625
so sometimes I think I married my husband

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:02.147
because he was the closest
chair to me at 30."

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.174
Where are the twentysomethings here?

00:07:05.198 --> 00:07:07.277
Do not do that.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.279
(Laughter)

00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:12.518
Okay, now that sounds a little flip,
but make no mistake,

00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:14.526
the stakes are very high.

00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:17.161
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,

00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:19.488
there is enormous thirtysomething pressure

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:23.258
to jump-start a career,
pick a city, partner up,

00:07:23.282 --> 00:07:26.800
and have two or three kids
in a much shorter period of time.

00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:29.866
Many of these things are incompatible,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.439
and as research is just starting to show,

00:07:32.463 --> 00:07:37.066
simply harder and more stressful to do
all at once in our 30s.

00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:42.672
The post-millennial midlife crisis
isn't buying a red sports car.

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:47.640
It's realizing you can't have
that career you now want.

00:07:48.482 --> 00:07:51.649
It's realizing you can't have
that child you now want,

00:07:51.673 --> 00:07:53.863
or you can't give your child a sibling.

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:57.594
Too many thirtysomethings
and fortysomethings

00:07:57.618 --> 00:08:01.620
look at themselves, and at me,
sitting across the room,

00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:03.714
and say about their 20s,

00:08:03.738 --> 00:08:07.364
"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:12.785
I want to change what twentysomethings
are doing and thinking.

00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:15.326
Here's a story about how that can go.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.105
It's a story about a woman named Emma.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.874
At 25, Emma came to my office

00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:26.350
because she was, in her words,
having an identity crisis.

00:08:27.192 --> 00:08:30.582
She said she thought she might
like to work in art or entertainment,

00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:32.167
but she hadn't decided yet,

00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:35.935
so she'd spent the last few years
waiting tables instead.

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:39.475
Because it was cheaper,
she lived with a boyfriend

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:42.631
who displayed his temper
more than his ambition.

00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:45.280
And as hard as her 20s were,

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:47.386
her early life had been even harder.

00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:50.212
She often cried in our sessions,

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:52.437
but then would collect herself by saying,

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.605
"You can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends."

00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:00.390
Well one day, Emma comes in
and she hangs her head in her lap,

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:03.532
and she sobbed for most of the hour.

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:06.257
She'd just bought a new address book,

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:09.957
and she'd spent the morning
filling in her many contacts,

00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:12.591
but then she'd been left
staring at that empty blank

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:14.305
that comes after the words

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:17.059
"In case of emergency, please call ..."

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.540
She was nearly hysterical
when she looked at me and said,

00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:24.840
"Who's going to be there for me
if I get in a car wreck?

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.741
Who's going to take care of me
if I have cancer?"

00:09:29.118 --> 00:09:31.623
Now in that moment,
it took everything I had

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:33.301
not to say, "I will."

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.995
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist
who really, really cared.

00:09:38.372 --> 00:09:42.293
Emma needed a better life,
and I knew this was her chance.

00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.633
I had learned too much
since I first worked with Alex

00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:50.243
to just sit there
while Emma's defining decade

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:51.740
went parading by.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.103
So over the next weeks and months,

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.650
I told Emma three things

00:09:57.674 --> 00:10:00.809
that every twentysomething,
male or female,

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.481
deserves to hear.

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:07.982
First, I told Emma to forget
about having an identity crisis

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:10.353
and get some identity capital.

00:10:11.273 --> 00:10:12.923
By "get identity capital,"

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:16.567
I mean do something
that adds value to who you are.

00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:19.080
Do something that's an investment

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:21.420
in who you might want to be next.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.906
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.167
and no one knows the future of work,

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:28.860
but I do know this:

00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:32.110
Identity capital begets identity capital.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.390
So now is the time
for that cross-country job,

00:10:35.414 --> 00:10:38.162
that internship, that startup
you want to try.

00:10:38.924 --> 00:10:42.353
I'm not discounting
twentysomething exploration here,

00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:47.327
but I am discounting exploration
that's not supposed to count,

00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:49.962
which, by the way, is not exploration.

00:10:49.986 --> 00:10:51.930
That's procrastination.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.238
I told Emma to explore
work and make it count.

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:02.832
Second, I told Emma
that the urban tribe is overrated.

00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:06.866
Best friends are great
for giving rides to the airport,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.644
but twentysomethings who huddle together
with like-minded peers

00:11:10.668 --> 00:11:12.149
limit who they know,

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:14.547
what they know, how they think,

00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:16.971
how they speak, and where they work.

00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.749
That new piece of capital,
that new person to date

00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:24.452
almost always comes
from outside the inner circle.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.974
New things come
from what are called our weak ties,

00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:30.215
our friends of friends of friends.

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:35.009
So yes, half of twentysomethings
are un- or under-employed.

00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.047
But half aren't,

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.030
and weak ties are how
you get yourself into that group.

00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:43.400
Half of new jobs are never posted,

00:11:43.424 --> 00:11:47.929
so reaching out to your neighbor's boss
is how you get that unposted job.

00:11:48.462 --> 00:11:52.367
It's not cheating. It's the science
of how information spreads.

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:55.425
Last but not least, Emma believed

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:58.623
that you can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends.

00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:01.184
Now this was true for her growing up,

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:04.472
but as a twentysomething,
soon Emma would pick her family

00:12:04.496 --> 00:12:08.256
when she partnered with someone
and created a family of her own.

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:13.023
I told Emma the time
to start picking your family is now.

00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:18.546
Now you may be thinking that 30
is actually a better time to settle down

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.697
than 20, or even 25,

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:23.047
and I agree with you.

00:12:23.674 --> 00:12:26.603
But grabbing whoever you're living
with or sleeping with

00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:29.714
when everyone on Facebook
starts walking down the aisle

00:12:29.738 --> 00:12:31.696
is not progress.

00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:36.484
The best time to work on your marriage
is before you have one,

00:12:36.508 --> 00:12:39.291
and that means being
as intentional with love

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:40.923
as you are with work.

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:44.352
Picking your family
is about consciously choosing

00:12:44.376 --> 00:12:46.626
who and what you want

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.202
rather than just making it work
or killing time

00:12:50.226 --> 00:12:52.739
with whoever happens to be choosing you.

00:12:53.963 --> 00:12:55.630
So what happened to Emma?

00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:58.225
Well, we went through that address book,

00:12:58.249 --> 00:13:00.142
and she found an old roommate's cousin

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.903
who worked at an art museum
in another state.

00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:06.346
That weak tie helped her get a job there.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.288
That job offer gave her the reason
to leave that live-in boyfriend.

00:13:11.216 --> 00:13:14.998
Now, five years later, she's a special
events planner for museums.

00:13:15.022 --> 00:13:18.375
She's married to a man
she mindfully chose.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:21.451
She loves her new career,
she loves her new family,

00:13:21.475 --> 00:13:23.598
and she sent me a card that said,

00:13:23.622 --> 00:13:25.610
"Now the emergency contact blanks

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:27.473
don't seem big enough."

00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:31.678
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,

00:13:31.702 --> 00:13:34.512
but that's what I love about working
with twentysomethings.

00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:36.161
They are so easy to help.

00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:40.549
Twentysomethings are like airplanes
just leaving LAX,

00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:42.536
bound for somewhere west.

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:46.213
Right after takeoff,
a slight change in course

00:13:46.237 --> 00:13:50.293
is the difference between landing
in Alaska or Fiji.

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:56.871
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,

00:13:56.895 --> 00:13:59.673
one good conversation, one good break,

00:13:59.697 --> 00:14:02.980
one good TED Talk,
can have an enormous effect

00:14:03.004 --> 00:14:06.373
across years and even generations to come.

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:09.588
So here's an idea worth spreading

00:14:09.612 --> 00:14:11.753
to every twentysomething you know.

00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:15.038
It's as simple as what I learned
to say to Alex.

00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:17.279
It's what I now have the privilege

00:14:17.303 --> 00:14:21.132
of saying to twentysomethings
like Emma every single day:

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:26.118
Thirty is not the new 20,
so claim your adulthood,

00:14:26.142 --> 00:14:29.715
get some identity capital,
use your weak ties,

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:31.364
pick your family.

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:34.509
Don't be defined by what you didn't know

00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:35.601
or didn't do.

00:14:36.102 --> 00:14:38.684
You're deciding your life right now.

00:14:39.308 --> 00:14:40.318
Thank you.

00:14:40.342 --> 00:14:43.764
(Applause)
