00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.675
What I want to do this afternoon

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.540
is something a little different than what's scheduled.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.486
Foreign policy, you can figure that out

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.520
by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.354
but — (Laughter) —

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:30.916
I want to talk about young people and structure,

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.883
young people and structure.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:35.131
This was last Wednesday afternoon

00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.635
at a school in Brooklyn, New York,

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:40.569
at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.406
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:46.873
They were around me in three directions.

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:49.669
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:51.514
You'll notice that the building is rather austere.

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:55.645
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:58.176
They still have old blackboards and whatnot.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.767
And there are about 300 kids in this school,

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.419
and the school's been going now for four years,

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.373
and they're about to graduate their first class.

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.444
Twenty-two people are graduating,

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:10.687
and all 22 are going to college.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.427
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part,

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.950
just one person in the home,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.856
usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:21.343
and they come here for their education

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:22.756
and for their structure.

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:25.564
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:28.057
on my Facebook page last week,

00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:29.691
and somebody wrote in,

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:34.677
"Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:39.048
And then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter)

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:41.758
He does look good, because kids need structure,

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:45.264
and the trick I play in all of my school appearances

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:48.163
is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.347
I then invite them to ask questions,

00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:52.212
and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up,"

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.551
and I make them come up and stand in front of me.

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.665
I make them stand at attention like a soldier.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.447
Put your arms straight down at your side,

00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:01.899
look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.334
and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.591
No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:09.962
(Laughter)

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:13.227
And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz --

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:17.064
he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.251
(Laughter)

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.994
So people think I'm being unkind to this kid.

00:02:21.994 --> 00:02:23.638
No, we're having a little fun.

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:26.052
And the thing about it, I've done this for years,

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:29.212
the younger they are, the more fun it is.

00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:32.152
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.031
I have to figure out how to keep them quiet.

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:36.034
You know that they'll always start yakking.

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:37.639
And so I play a little game with them

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.211
before I make them stand at attention.

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.484
I say, "Now listen. In the army,

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:43.812
when we want you to pay attention,

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:46.997
we have a command. It's called 'at ease.'

00:02:46.997 --> 00:02:50.571
It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.709
Do you understand?"

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.574
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."

00:02:56.574 --> 00:02:59.871
And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"

00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:03.376
"Huh!" (Laughter)

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:05.898
"Yes, General. Yes, General."

00:03:05.898 --> 00:03:08.301
Try it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)

00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:11.354
I don't think so.

00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:14.368
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:16.090
from my military experience.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.519
Because for the majority of my adult life,

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.579
I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.024
And we would bring them into the army,

00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:28.473
and the first thing we would do is to put them

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:32.560
in an environment of structure, put them in ranks,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.983
make them all wear the same clothes,

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:36.477
cut all their hair off so they look alike,

00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:38.681
make sure that they are standing in ranks.

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.461
We teach them how to go right face, left face,

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:42.378
so they can obey instructions and know

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:45.306
the consequences of not obeying instructions.

00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:46.771
It gives them structure.

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.951
And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.

00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.825
And they hate him.

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.173
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:59.022
and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:02.026
But then the most amazing thing happens over time.

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:05.052
Once that structure is developed,

00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:08.270
once they understand the reason for something,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.276
once they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:16.096
I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:18.708
And that's just the way it is. You got that, son?

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:21.546
Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:23.942
yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:26.105
Don't start telling me why you didn't do something.

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.757
It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."

00:04:28.757 --> 00:04:29.880
"You didn't shave.""But sir —"

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.135
"No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:34.875
I'm telling you you didn't shave."

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.081
"No excuse, sir.""Attaboy, you're learning fast."

00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.469
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.923
once you put them in that structure.

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:47.781
In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.

00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:50.898
And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:52.796
and they never forget the drill sergeant.

00:04:52.796 --> 00:04:55.431
They come to respect him.

00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:59.346
And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect

00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:01.377
in the lives of our children.

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:03.350
I spend a lot of time with youth groups,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.641
and I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.320
We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.067
Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.008
Let's get it all online."

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:18.314
That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.

00:05:18.314 --> 00:05:21.576
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:26.184
with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.

00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:29.053
When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?

00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:31.236
No, no, it begins the first time

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.917
a child in a mother's arms

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.681
looks up at the mother

00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:40.045
and says, "Oh, this must be my mother.

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:42.418
She's the one who feeds me.

00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:44.624
Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,

00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:47.138
she takes care of me.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.161
It's her language I will learn."

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.910
And at that moment they shut out all the other languages

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.266
that they could be learning at that age,

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:58.215
but by three months, that's her.

00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:00.535
And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother

00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:02.528
or grandmother, whoever's doing it,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.742
that is when the education process begins.

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:06.470
That's when language begins.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.719
That's when love begins. That's when structure begins.

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.207
That's when you start to imprint on the child

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:13.425
that "you are special,

00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:16.614
you are different from every other child in the world.

00:06:16.614 --> 00:06:18.698
And we're going to read to you."

00:06:18.698 --> 00:06:20.769
A child who has not been read to

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:22.913
is in danger when that child gets to school.

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:24.973
A child who doesn't know his or her colors

00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:27.987
or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.386
doesn't know how to do those things,

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:32.056
and doesn't know how to do something that

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:34.932
goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:38.820
Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.343
This is the way children are raised properly.

00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:45.138
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:49.231
and they're, much to the distress of my children,

00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:53.907
they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:59.132
And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.

00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:01.391
And I'm working at all the energy I have

00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:03.721
to sort of communicate this message that

00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:07.600
we need preschool, we need Head Start,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.120
we need prenatal care.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.335
The education process begins even before the child is born,

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:17.043
and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.

00:07:17.043 --> 00:07:19.457
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:22.502
and so many of our schools where kids are coming

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:24.813
to first grade and their eyes are blazing,

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:28.424
they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,

00:07:28.424 --> 00:07:31.825
and then they realize they're not like the other first graders

00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:36.289
who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.983
And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have

00:07:38.983 --> 00:07:43.129
that structure and minding in the beginning

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.039
start to realize they're behind, and what do they do?

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.360
They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.446
to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:53.310
It's predictable.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.276
If you're not at the right reading level at third grade,

00:07:56.276 --> 00:08:00.353
you are a candidate for jail at age 18,

00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:02.590
and we have the highest incarceration rate

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.518
because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.734
The last chapter in my book is called

00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:10.645
"The Gift of a Good Start."

00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:14.337
The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:17.040
I was privileged to have that kind of good start.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.931
I was not a great student.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.599
I was a public school kid in New York City,

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:24.239
and I didn't do well at all.

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:28.051
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript

00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.494
from kindergarten through college.

00:08:30.494 --> 00:08:32.764
I wanted it when I was writing my first book.

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:34.803
I wanted to see if my memory was correct,

00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:38.078
and, my God, it was. (Laughter)

00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:40.866
Straight C everywhere.

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:43.307
And I finally bounced through high school,

00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:45.386
got into the City College of New York

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:49.026
with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:51.765
and then I started out in engineering,

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:54.323
and that only lasted six months. (Laughter)

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:58.336
And then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.

00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:00.338
And then I found ROTC.

00:09:00.338 --> 00:09:04.272
I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:08.166
and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.

00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:12.152
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:14.820
And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.421
and as this structure is being developed inside of you,

00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:20.457
always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,

00:09:20.457 --> 00:09:23.594
and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.

00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:25.958
That's what's going on. And that's what I found.

00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.612
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.

00:09:28.612 --> 00:09:30.413
I'd been there four and a half going on five years,

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:34.823
and my grades were not doing particularly well,

00:09:34.823 --> 00:09:37.965
and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:40.879
And so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.229
Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:48.585
And so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades

00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:52.031
and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."

00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:58.747
And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)

00:09:58.747 --> 00:10:02.481
Yep. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:05.530
They said, "It's good enough for government work.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.028
Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."

00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:10.880
So they shipped me off to the army,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.548
and lo and behold, many years later,

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:18.854
I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)

00:10:18.854 --> 00:10:22.056
So, I tell young people everywhere,

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:26.247
it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life

00:10:26.247 --> 00:10:29.858
that determines where you end up in life,

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:32.543
and you are blessed to be living in a country that,

00:10:32.543 --> 00:10:35.729
no matter where you start, you have opportunities

00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:38.433
so long as you believe in yourself,

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:41.424
you believe in the society and the country,

00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:44.843
and you believe that you can self-improve

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:47.254
and educate yourself as you go along.

00:10:47.254 --> 00:10:49.487
And that's the key to success.

00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:52.837
But it begins with the gift of a good start.

00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:55.310
If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.988
if we don't invest at the earliest age,

00:10:58.988 --> 00:11:01.730
we're going to be running into difficulties.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.996
It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall

00:11:05.996 --> 00:11:08.718
and almost 50 percent of our minority population

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:12.192
living in low-income areas,

00:11:12.192 --> 00:11:14.973
because they're not getting the gift of a good start.

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:18.951
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,

00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:22.506
a good family, but having a family that said to me,

00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:26.453
"Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:29.815
in 1920 and 1924.

00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:33.990
We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.516
We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:41.896
or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.947
If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people

00:11:44.947 --> 00:11:47.416
that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"

00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:50.073
they'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."

00:11:50.073 --> 00:11:56.431
(Laughter)

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:58.957
They had expectations for all of the cousins

00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:02.540
and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.699
but they had more than just expectations for us.

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:09.610
They stuck into our hearts like a dagger

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.472
a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."

00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:16.135
Sometimes I would get in trouble,

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.978
and my parents were coming home,

00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:21.459
and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:23.670
and I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.445
take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."

00:12:28.445 --> 00:12:31.202
It devastated me when my mother did that to me.

00:12:31.202 --> 00:12:33.366
And I also had this extended network.

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:36.354
Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:38.235
a family, a community.

00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:42.459
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:44.315
I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,

00:12:44.315 --> 00:12:46.236
but there were these tenement buildings,

00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:49.449
and these women were always hanging out one of the windows,

00:12:49.449 --> 00:12:51.071
leaning on a pillow.

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.830
They never left. (Laughter)

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.864
I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,

00:12:56.864 --> 00:12:58.346
and they were always there.

00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:01.220
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.766
They never did anything.

00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:06.479
But what they did was keep us in play.

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:08.765
They kept us in play.

00:13:08.765 --> 00:13:11.023
And they didn't care

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:15.770
whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.863
and they never expected any generals in the family,

00:13:18.863 --> 00:13:22.723
as long as you got an education and then you got a job.

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:24.714
"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.

00:13:24.714 --> 00:13:27.529
You get a job and get out of the house.

00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:30.007
We don't have time to waste for that.

00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:33.582
And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."

00:13:33.582 --> 00:13:39.104
And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:43.386
back into our families, all families.

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:46.721
And it is so important that all of you here today

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.397
who are successful people,

00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:53.952
and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,

00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:55.690
it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.341
and find kids like Mr. Cruz

00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:01.711
who can make it if you give them the structure,

00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:03.698
if you reach back and help, if you mentor,

00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:06.072
if you invest in boys and girls clubs,

00:14:06.072 --> 00:14:07.963
if you work with your school system,

00:14:07.963 --> 00:14:09.237
make sure it's the best school system,

00:14:09.237 --> 00:14:14.060
and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.882
not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.

00:14:16.882 --> 00:14:21.035
All of us have to have a commitment to do that.

00:14:21.035 --> 00:14:23.685
And we're not just investing in the kids.

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:25.738
We're investing in our future.

00:14:25.738 --> 00:14:28.559
We're going to be a minority-majority country

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:30.552
in one more generation.

00:14:30.552 --> 00:14:33.921
Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.

00:14:33.921 --> 00:14:36.501
And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.732
We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:41.684
of this great country of ours,

00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:45.160
a country that is like no other,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.845
a country that amazes me every single day,

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.465
a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.

00:14:49.465 --> 00:14:52.437
That's how the system's supposed to work.

00:14:52.437 --> 00:14:56.016
It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.

00:14:56.016 --> 00:15:00.012
We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.

00:15:00.012 --> 00:15:01.697
We are a nation of immigrants.

00:15:01.697 --> 00:15:04.841
That's why we need sound immigration policy.

00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:08.076
It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:11.159
to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:13.312
or we can send back home with an education

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.693
to help their people rise up out of poverty.

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:20.536
One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love

00:15:20.536 --> 00:15:21.933
of going to my hometown of New York

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:23.727
and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day

00:15:23.727 --> 00:15:26.208
and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:27.662
from all over the world.

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:31.300
But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.686
and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.

00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:37.837
Gotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:40.817
And no matter where I am or what I'm doing,

00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:42.092
I've got to do that.

00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:44.757
I even did it when I was Secretary of State.

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:47.658
I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria

00:15:47.658 --> 00:15:50.738
— (Laughter)&nbsp;—

00:15:50.738 --> 00:15:54.049
be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street

00:15:54.049 --> 00:15:56.360
looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.559
In those days, I had five bodyguards around me

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:01.453
and three New York City police cars would roll alongside

00:16:01.453 --> 00:16:06.273
to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)

00:16:06.273 --> 00:16:07.941
And I would order the hot dog from the guy,

00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.387
and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.064
at the bodyguards and the police cars --

00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:14.146
"I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter)

00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:18.482
"It's okay, it's okay."

00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:20.930
But now I'm alone. I'm alone.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.721
I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.

00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:26.383
But I gotta have my hot dog.

00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:30.147
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening

00:16:30.147 --> 00:16:32.447
down by Columbus Circle.

00:16:32.447 --> 00:16:35.302
And the scene repeats itself so often.

00:16:35.302 --> 00:16:38.656
I'll go up and ask for my hot dog,

00:16:38.656 --> 00:16:41.018
and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,

00:16:41.018 --> 00:16:43.720
he'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.614
You're, well, you're General Powell."

00:16:45.614 --> 00:16:48.304
"Yes, yes.""Oh ... "

00:16:48.304 --> 00:16:49.455
I hand him the money.

00:16:49.455 --> 00:16:54.380
"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.143
America has paid me. I never forget where I came from.

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:01.333
But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.601
I accept the generosity, continue up the street,

00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:05.830
and it washes over me, my God,

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.848
it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.

00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:12.035
So we are still that magnificent country,

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:14.810
but we are fueled by young people coming up

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.814
from every land in the world,

00:17:17.814 --> 00:17:21.341
and it is our obligation as contributing citizens

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.127
to this wonderful country of ours

00:17:23.127 --> 00:17:26.274
to make sure that no child gets left behind.

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:28.352
Thank you very much.

00:17:28.352 --> 00:17:40.459
(Applause)
