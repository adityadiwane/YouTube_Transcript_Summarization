00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:16.513
On January 4, 1934,

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:19.529
a young man delivered a report

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.914
to the United States Congress

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.868
that 80 years on,

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:28.528
still shapes the lives of
everyone in this room today,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:34.222
still shapes the lives of
everyone on this planet.

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:37.102
That young man wasn't a politician,

00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:39.101
he wasn't a businessman,

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.438
a civil rights activist

00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:42.213
or a faith leader.

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:45.484
He was that most unlikely of heroes,

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:47.981
an economist.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.552
His name was Simon Kuznets

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:54.696
and the report that 
he delivered was called

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:59.148
"National Income, 1929-1932."

00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:00.632
Now, you might think

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:03.723
this is a rather dry and dull report.

00:01:03.723 --> 00:01:05.805
And you're absolutely right.

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:08.260
It's dry as a bone.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.570
But this report is the foundation

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.503
of how, today, we judge the 
success of countries:

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:17.052
what we know best as
Gross Domestic Product,

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:19.363
GDP.

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:22.266
GDP has defined and shaped our lives

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.864
for the last 80 years.

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.681
And today I want to talk about 

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.520
a different way to measure
the success of countries,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.669
a different way to define 
and shape our lives

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:36.926
for the next 80 years.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:38.817
But first, we have to understand

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:42.726
how GDP came to
dominate our lives.

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:44.986
Kuznets' report was delivered

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:46.708
at a moment of crisis.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.734
The U.S. economy was plummeting

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.349
into the Great Depression

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.434
and policy makers were 
struggling to respond.

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:56.579
Struggling because they didn't
know what was going on.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.961
They didn't have data and statistics.

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.783
So what Kuznet's report gave them

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:06.061
was reliable data on what 
the U.S. economy

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:07.196
was producing,

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:10.264
updated year by year.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:12.604
And armed with this information,

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:14.612
policy makers were, eventually,

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:18.040
able to find a way out 
of the slump.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.922
And because Kuznets' invention

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.694
was found to be so useful,

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:23.382
it spread around the world.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.851
And now today, every country

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.815
produces GDP statistics.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.922
But, in that first report,

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.466
Kuznets himself delivered a warning.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.447
It's in the introductory chapter.

00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:39.481
On page seven he says,

00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.110
"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.664
scarcely be inferred

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.664
from a measurement of 
national income

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.601
as defined above."

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.969
It's not the greatest sound 
bite in the world,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.598
and it's dressed up in the cautious 
language of the economist.

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:56.774
But his message was clear:

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:58.508
GDP is a tool

00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:01.566
to help us measure
economic performance.

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:04.534
It's not a measure
of our well-being.

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:09.351
And it shouldn't be a guide 
to all decision making.

00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:12.221
But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.777
We live in a world where

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.900
GDP is the benchmark of success

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.177
in a global economy.

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:22.406
Our politicians boast when
GDP goes up.

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:23.690
Markets move

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.564
and trillions of dollars of capital

00:03:25.564 --> 00:03:26.988
move around the world

00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:28.739
based on which countries
are going up

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.580
and which countries 
are going down,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.204
all measured in GDP.

00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:34.533
Our societies have become

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:38.908
engines to create more GDP.

00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:42.443
But we know that GDP is flawed.

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.973
It ignores the environment.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:48.629
It counts bombs and prisons as progress.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.871
It can't count happiness or community.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:56.621
And it has nothing to say 
about fairness or justice.

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.321
Is it any surprise that our world,

00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:02.155
marching to the drumbeat of GDP,

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:05.432
is teetering on the brink
of environmental disaster

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.938
and filled with anger and conflict?

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:13.331
We need a better way
to measure our societies,

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:18.724
a measure based on the real 
things that matter to real people.

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.686
Do I have enough to eat?

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:22.762
Can I read and write?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.500
Am I safe?

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.655
Do I have rights?

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:29.784
Do I live in a society where
I'm not discriminated against?

00:04:29.784 --> 00:04:36.222
Is my future and the future of my children 
prevented from environmental destruction?

00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:38.113
These are questions that GDP

00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:43.016
does not and cannot answer.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.535
There have, of course,

00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:45.921
been efforts in the past

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:48.563
to move beyond GDP.

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:49.938
But I believe that we're living

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:51.212
in a moment when we

00:04:51.212 --> 00:04:54.952
are ready for a measurement revolution.

00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:57.628
We're ready because we've seen,

00:04:57.628 --> 00:04:59.862
in the financial crisis of 2008,

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.681
how our fetish for economic growth

00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:04.712
led us so far astray.

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:07.096
We've seen, in the Arab Spring,

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:08.941
how countries like Tunisia

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.691
were supposedly economic superstars,

00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:13.216
but they were societies

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:16.495
that were seething with discontentment.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:20.183
We're ready, because today
we have the technology

00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:22.498
to gather and analyze data

00:05:22.498 --> 00:05:26.545
in ways that would have been
unimaginable to Kuznets.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:31.428
Today, I'd like to introduce you 
to the Social Progress Index.

00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:34.155
It's a measure of the 
well-being of society,

00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:36.912
completely separate from GDP.

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:40.563
It's a whole new way
of looking at the world.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.179
The Social Progress Index

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:43.502
begins by defining what it

00:05:43.502 --> 00:05:45.449
means to be a good society

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.940
based around three dimensions.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.035
The first is, does everyone have
the basic needs for survival:

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:55.885
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.605
Secondly, does everyone have

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:01.436
access to the building blocks 
to improve their lives:

00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:05.948
education, information, health
and sustainable environment?

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:09.632
And then third, does every 
individual have access

00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:12.412
to a chance to pursue their goals

00:06:12.412 --> 00:06:14.260
and dreams and ambitions

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.417
free from obstacles?

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.964
Do they have rights,

00:06:16.964 --> 00:06:18.353
freedom of choice,

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:19.875
freedom from discrimination

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:23.336
and access to the the world's
most advanced knowledge?

00:06:23.336 --> 00:06:26.700
Together, these 12 components

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.035
form the Social Progress framework.

00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:32.123
And for each of these 12 components,

00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:35.554
we have indicators to measure 
how countries are performing.

00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:38.683
Not indicators of effort or intention,

00:06:38.683 --> 00:06:40.931
but real achievement.

00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.133
We don't measure how much
a country spends on healthcare,

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:48.446
we measure the length and 
quality of people's lives.

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:53.045
We don't measure whether governments
pass laws against discrimination,

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:57.475
we measure whether people 
experience discrimination.

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:58.835
But what you want to know

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.851
is who's top, don't you?
(Laughter)

00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.668
I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.

00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:05.194
Okay, I'm going to show you.

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:07.590
I'm going to show you on this chart.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.934
So here we are,

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:13.140
what I've done here is put on the 
vertical axis social progress.

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:14.481
Higher is better.

00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.503
And then, just for comparison,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:17.825
just for fun,

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:21.684
on the horizontal axis
is GDP per capita.

00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:23.583
Further to the right is more.

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:26.737
So the country in the world

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.127
with the highest social progress,

00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:33.486
the number one country on social progress

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.882
is New Zealand.

00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:40.398
(Applause)

00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.215
Well done! Never been; must go.

00:07:43.215 --> 00:07:45.537
(Laughter)

00:07:45.537 --> 00:07:48.399
The country with the least social progress,

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.714
I'm sorry to say, is Chad.

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:53.638
I've never been; maybe next year.

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.447
(Laughter)

00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:57.639
Or maybe the year after.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.212
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.592
You're thinking, "Aha,

00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:02.988
but New Zealand has a higher GDP

00:08:02.988 --> 00:08:04.850
than Chad!"

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.344
It's a good point, well made.

00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:08.806
But let me show you

00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:10.069
two other countries.

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:12.495
Here's the United States —

00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:15.242
considerably richer than New Zealand,

00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:17.688
but with a lower level of social progress.

00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:20.340
And then here's Senegal —

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.337
it's got a higher level of 
social progress than Chad,

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.286
but the same level of GDP.

00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:28.035
So what's going on? Well, look.

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:30.536
Let me bring in the rest of 
the countries of the world,

00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:32.744
the 132 we've been able to measure,

00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:35.082
each one represented by a dot.

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.581
There we go. Lots of dots.

00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:38.323
Now, obviously I can't do all of them,

00:08:38.323 --> 00:08:40.056
so a few highlights for you:

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:44.876
The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:46.980
My country, the United Kingdom,

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.697
is sort of middling, sort of dull,

00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:51.062
but who cares —

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:53.240
at least we beat the French.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.167
(Laughter)

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:03.004
And then looking at the 
emerging economies,

00:09:03.004 --> 00:09:06.338
top of the BRICS, 
pleased to say, is Brazil.

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.044
(Applause)

00:09:08.044 --> 00:09:09.831
Come on, cheer!

00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:11.773
Go, Brazil!

00:09:11.773 --> 00:09:13.306
Beating South Africa,

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:14.599
then Russia,

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:15.733
then China

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:17.307
and then India.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.672
Tucked away on the right-hand side,

00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:23.025
you will see a dot of a 
country with a lot of GDP

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:24.968
but not a huge amount 
of social progress —

00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:26.946
that's Kuwait.

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:28.637
Just above Brazil

00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:30.956
is a social progress superpower —

00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:32.456
that's Costa Rica.

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:36.431
It's got a level of social progress the same 
as some Western European countries,

00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:38.400
with a much lower GDP.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.682
Now, my slide is getting 
a little cluttered

00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:42.364
and I'd like to step back a bit.

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:43.818
So let me take away these countries,

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:46.732
and then pop in the regression line.

00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:48.385
So this shows the average relationship

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:50.896
between GDP and social progress.

00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:53.138
The first thing to notice,

00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:54.993
is that there's lots of noise

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:56.690
around the trend line.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.275
And what this shows,

00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:01.157
what this empirically demonstrates,

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:04.192
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:10:04.192 --> 00:10:07.395
At every level of GDP per capita,

00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:10.593
there are opportunities
for more social progress,

00:10:10.593 --> 00:10:12.596
risks of less.

00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:14.056
The second thing to notice

00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:16.559
is that for poor countries,

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.532
the curve is really steep.

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:19.807
So what this tells us is that

00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:21.060
if poor countries can get

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.954
a little bit of extra GDP,

00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:24.737
and if they reinvest that

00:10:24.737 --> 00:10:27.409
in doctors, nurses, water supplies,

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:28.782
sanitation, etc.,

00:10:28.782 --> 00:10:30.801
there's a lot of social progress bang

00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:32.387
for your GDP buck.

00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:35.962
And that's good news, and that's what 
we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,

00:10:35.962 --> 00:10:37.963
with a lot of people lifted out of poverty

00:10:37.963 --> 00:10:40.173
by economic growth and good policies

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.045
in poorer countries.

00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:44.242
But go on a bit further up the curve,

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.351
and then we see it flattening out.

00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.603
Each extra dollar of GDP

00:10:48.603 --> 00:10:51.839
is buying less and less social progress.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.513
And with more and more
of the world's population

00:10:54.513 --> 00:10:57.076
living on this part of the curve,

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.300
it means GDP is becoming

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.084
less and less useful

00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:03.600
as a guide to our development.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.747
I'll show you an example of Brazil.

00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:06.970
Here's Brazil:

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.837
social progress of about 70 out of 100,

00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:12.335
GDP per capita about 
14,000 dollars a year.

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:15.256
And look, Brazil's above the line.

00:11:15.256 --> 00:11:17.142
Brazil is doing a reasonably good job

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:20.467
of turning GDP into social progress.

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:22.454
But where does Brazil go next?

00:11:22.454 --> 00:11:23.966
Let's say that Brazil

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:25.738
adopts a bold economic plan

00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:28.041
to double GDP in the next decade.

00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:31.657
But that is only half a plan.

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:33.934
It's less than half a plan,

00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:37.182
because where does Brazil
want to go on social progress?

00:11:37.186 --> 00:11:39.504
Brazil, it's possible

00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:41.239
to increase your growth,

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:42.816
increase your GDP,

00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:44.706
while stagnating or going backwards

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:46.055
on social progress.

00:11:46.055 --> 00:11:47.241
We don't want Brazil

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:48.973
to become like Russia.

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:51.288
What you really want is for Brazil

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:56.241
to get ever more efficient at creating 
social progress from its GDP,

00:11:56.241 --> 00:11:58.539
so it becomes more like New Zealand.

00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:00.119
And what that means is that

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.776
Brazil needs to prioritize social progress

00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:04.468
in its development plan

00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:06.880
and see that it's not just growth alone,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.532
it's growth with social progress.

00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:12.150
And that's what the Social 
Progress Index does:

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.760
It reframes the debate about development,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.820
not just about GDP alone,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.399
but inclusive, sustainable growth

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:23.818
that brings real improvements 
in people's lives.

00:12:23.818 --> 00:12:26.394
And it's not just about countries.

00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:29.184
Earlier this year,

00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:33.751
with our friends from the Imazon 
nonprofit here in Brazil,

00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:38.408
we launched the first subnational 
Social Progress Index.

00:12:38.408 --> 00:12:40.868
We did it for the Amazon region.

00:12:40.868 --> 00:12:44.655
It's an area the size of 
Europe, 24 million people,

00:12:44.656 --> 00:12:47.084
one of the most deprived 
parts of the country.

00:12:47.084 --> 00:12:48.994
And here are the results,

00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:50.629
and this is broken down

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:54.133
into nearly 800 different municipalities.

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:55.816
And with this detailed information

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:58.034
about the real quality of life

00:12:58.034 --> 00:12:59.977
in this part of the country,

00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:01.957
Imazon and other partners

00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:04.286
from government, 
business and civil society

00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:06.000
can work together to construct

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.677
a development plan

00:13:07.677 --> 00:13:10.014
that will help really improve
people's lives,

00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:13.250
while protecting that 
precious global asset

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.221
that is the Amazon Rainforest.

00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:18.122
And this is just the beginning,

00:13:18.122 --> 00:13:20.501
You can create a Social Progress Index

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:25.656
for any state, region, 
city or municipality.

00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:27.729
We all know and love TEDx;

00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:29.971
this is Social Pogress-x.

00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:33.165
This is a tool for anyone to come and use.

00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:36.045
Contrary to the way we 
sometimes talk about it,

00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:42.365
GDP was not handed down from 
God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:46.360
It's a measurement tool
invented in the 20th century

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.152
to address the challenges
of the 20th century.

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:53.004
In the 21st century,

00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:55.456
we face new challenges:

00:13:55.456 --> 00:13:58.564
aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.

00:13:58.564 --> 00:14:00.223
To face those challenges,

00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:02.243
we need new tools of measurement,

00:14:02.243 --> 00:14:05.997
new ways of valuing progress.

00:14:05.997 --> 00:14:08.395
Imagine if we could measure

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.925
what nonprofits, charities,

00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:12.894
volunteers, civil society organizations

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:16.700
really contribute to our society.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.768
Imagine if businesses competed

00:14:19.768 --> 00:14:23.179
not just on the basis of
their economic contribution,

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:27.003
but on their contribution 
to social progress.

00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:30.950
Imagine if we could hold 
politicians to account

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.146
for really improving people's lives.

00:14:35.146 --> 00:14:38.131
Imagine if we could work together —

00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:43.199
government, business, 
civil society, me, you —

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:48.690
and make this century the 
century of social progress.

00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:49.783
Thank you.

00:14:49.783 --> 00:14:55.815
(Applause)
