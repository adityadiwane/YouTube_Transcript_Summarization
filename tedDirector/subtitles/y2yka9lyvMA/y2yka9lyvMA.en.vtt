00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.982
Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.348
(Applause)

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:19.550
Thanks, Pat.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:21.132
Thank you!

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.516
Getting me all wound up, now!

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.546
(Laughter)

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.757
Pat Mitchell: Good!

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:32.538
You know, when I was watching
the video again of the match,

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:37.051
you must have felt
like the fate of the world's women

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.673
was on every stroke you took.

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:41.963
Were you feeling that?

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:46.154
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --
he was the former number one player,

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.180
he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:51.086
He was one of my heroes and I admired him.

00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:55.336
And that's the reason I beat him,
actually, because I respected him.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.459
(Laughter)

00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:59.079
It's true -- my mom
and especially my dad always said:

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:01.981
"Respect your opponent,
and never underestimate them, ever."

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.293
And he was correct.
He was absolutely correct.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.282
But I knew it was about social change.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:12.324
And I was really nervous
whenever we announced it,

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:15.217
and I felt like the whole world
was on my shoulders.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:20.902
And I thought, "If I lose, it's going
to put women back 50 years, at least."

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:24.823
Title IX had just been passed
the year before -- June 23, 1972.

00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:28.466
And women's professional tennis --

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.763
there were nine of us who signed
a one-dollar contract in 1970 --

00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:33.886
now remember, the match is in '73.

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:37.614
So we were only in our
third year of having a tour

00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:41.898
where we could actually play,
have a place to compete and make a living.

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:44.918
So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.

00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:49.911
And our dream was for any girl,
born any place in the world --

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.493
if she was good enough --

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:55.628
there would be a place for her to compete
and for us to make a living.

00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:59.412
Because before 1968,
we made 14 dollars a day,

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:01.888
and we were under the control
of organizations.

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:04.105
So we really wanted
to break away from that.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.845
But we knew it wasn't really
about our generation so much;

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.919
we knew it was about
the future generations.

00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:12.948
We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:15.505
But every generation
has the chance to make it better.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:18.682
That was really on my mind.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:22.325
I really wanted to start matching
the hearts and minds to Title IX.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.136
Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,
which a lot of people probably don't,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.438
said that any federal funds given
to a high school, college or university,

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:32.536
either public or private,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.462
had to -- finally --
give equal monies to boys and girls.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.400
And that changed everything.

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:42.250
(Applause)

00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:44.032
So you can have a law,

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.971
but it's changing the hearts and minds
to match up with it.

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:49.542
That's when it really rocks, totally.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.717
So that was on my mind.

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:54.330
I wanted to start that change
in the hearts and minds.

00:02:54.354 --> 00:02:57.146
But two things came out of that match.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.326
For women: self-confidence, empowerment.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.892
They actually had enough nerve
to ask for a raise.

00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:07.516
Some women have waited
10, 15 years to ask.

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:09.839
I said, "More importantly,
did you get it?"

00:03:09.863 --> 00:03:10.931
(Laughter)

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:12.129
And they did!

00:03:12.153 --> 00:03:13.947
And for the men?

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:16.802
A lot of the men today don't realize it,

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:22.231
but if you're in your 50s, 60s
or whatever, late 40s,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:25.831
you're the first generation of men
of the Women's Movement --

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:27.147
whether you like it or not!

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:30.193
(Laughter)

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:31.500
(Applause)

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:32.675
And for the men,

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.314
what happened for the men,
they'd come up to me --

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:38.439
and most times, the men are the ones
who have tears in their eyes,

00:03:38.463 --> 00:03:39.614
it's very interesting.

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:43.651
They go, "Billie, I was very young
when I saw that match,

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:45.029
and now I have a daughter.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.990
And I am so happy I saw that
as a young man."

00:03:50.588 --> 00:03:54.137
And one of those young men,
at 12 years old, was President Obama.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.654
And he actually told me that
when I met him, he said:

00:03:57.678 --> 00:04:00.636
"You don't realize it,
but I saw that match at 12.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.513
And now I have two daughters,

00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:04.963
and it has made a difference
in how I raise them."

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:09.704
So both men and women got a lot
out of it, but different things.

00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:13.431
PM: And now there are generations --
at least one or two --

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:16.155
who have experienced the equality

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:21.065
that Title IX and other fights
along the way made possible.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.680
And for women, there are generations
who have also experienced teamwork.

00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:29.754
They got to play team sports
in a way they hadn't before.

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:35.227
So you had a legacy already built
in terms of being an athlete,

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:40.506
a legacy of the work you did
to lobby for equal pay for women athletes

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.804
and the Women's Sports Foundation.

00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:46.070
What now are you looking to accomplish

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:49.050
with The Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.208
BJK: I think it goes back
to an epiphany I had at 12.

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:55.233
At 11, I wanted to be the number one
tennis player in the world,

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:58.568
and a friend had asked me to play
and I said, "What's that?"

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.573
Tennis was not in my family --
basketball was, other sports.

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:04.465
Fast forward to 12 years old,

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:06.086
(Laughter)

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.324
and I'm finally starting
to play in tournaments

00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:10.799
where you get a ranking
at the end of the year.

00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:14.801
So I was daydreaming
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:19.589
and I started thinking about my sport
and how tiny it was,

00:05:19.613 --> 00:05:23.262
but also that everybody who played
wore white shoes, white clothes,

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:26.180
played with white balls --
everybody who played was white.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.842
And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
"Where is everyone else?"

00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:37.373
And that just kept sticking in my brain.

00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:38.548
And that moment,

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.526
I promised myself I'd fight
for equal rights and opportunities

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.298
for boys and girls, men and women,
the rest of my life.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.991
And that tennis, if I was fortunate
enough to become number one --

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.506
and I knew, being a girl,
it would be harder to have influence,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.507
already at that age --

00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:56.577
that I had this platform.

00:05:58.301 --> 00:05:59.969
And tennis is global.

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:03.192
And I thought, "You know what?

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:07.091
I've been given an opportunity
that very few people have had."

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:10.070
I didn't know if I was going
to make it -- this was only 12.

00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:13.222
I sure wanted it, but making it
is a whole other discussion.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:17.449
I just remember I promised myself,
and I really try to keep my word.

00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:21.976
That's who I truly am,
just fighting for people.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.210
And, unfortunately, women have had less.

00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:29.300
And we are considered less.

00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:31.592
And so my attentions,
where did they have to go?

00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:33.801
It was just ... you have to.

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:37.056
And learn to stick up for yourself,
hear your own voice.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.417
You hear the same words
keep coming out all the time,

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:44.158
and I got really lucky
because I had an education.

00:06:44.182 --> 00:06:46.750
And I think if you can see it
you can be it, you know?

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:48.990
If you can see it, you can be it.

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.018
You look at Pat,
you look at other leaders,

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:53.188
you look at these speakers,
look at yourself,

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.870
because everyone --

00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:56.252
everyone --

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:58.089
can do something extraordinary.

00:06:58.113 --> 00:06:59.555
Every single person.

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:03.812
PM: And your story, Billie,
has inspired so many women everywhere.

00:07:04.287 --> 00:07:07.158
Now with the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative,

00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:09.366
you're taking on an even bigger cause.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.414
Because one thing we hear a lot
about is women taking their voice,

00:07:13.438 --> 00:07:16.865
working to find their way
into leadership positions.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.721
But what you're talking
about is even bigger than that.

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:21.974
It's inclusive leadership.

00:07:21.998 --> 00:07:25.588
And this is a generation that has grown up
thinking more inclusively --

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.733
BJK: Isn't it great?
Look at the technology!

00:07:27.757 --> 00:07:32.309
It's amazing how it connects us all!
It's about connection.

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:35.947
It's simply amazing
what's possible because of it.

00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:38.411
But the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:41.499
is really about the workforce mostly,
and trying to change it,

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:45.868
so people can actually go to work
and be their authentic selves.

00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:48.929
Because most of us have two jobs:

00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:51.572
One, to fit in -- I'll give you
a perfect example.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.927
An African American woman
gets up an hour earlier to go to work,

00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.752
straightens her hair in the bathroom,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.959
goes to the bathroom
probably four, five, six times a day

00:07:59.983 --> 00:08:03.071
to keep straightening her hair,
to keep making sure she fits in.

00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:04.365
So she's working two jobs.

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.774
She's got this other job,
whatever that may be,

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.008
but she's also trying to fit in.

00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:13.075
Or this poor man who kept his diploma --

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:14.815
he went to University of Michigan,

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:18.160
but he never would talk about
his poverty as a youngster, ever --

00:08:18.184 --> 00:08:19.503
just would not mention it.

00:08:19.527 --> 00:08:21.776
So he made sure they saw
he was well-educated.

00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:24.782
And then you see a gay guy
who has an NFL --

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:27.447
which means American football
for all of you out there,

00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.422
it's a big deal, it's very macho --

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.469
and he talked about football all the time,

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:35.073
because he was gay
and he didn't want anybody to know.

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:36.874
It just goes on and on.

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:43.011
So my wish for everyone is to be able
to be their authentic self 24/7,

00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:44.841
that would be the ultimate.

00:08:44.865 --> 00:08:48.391
And we catch ourselves -- I mean,
I catch myself to this day.

00:08:48.415 --> 00:08:50.562
Even being gay I catch myself,
you know, like,

00:08:50.586 --> 00:08:51.736
(Gasp)

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:55.552
a little uncomfortable,
a little surge in my gut,

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:58.644
feeling not totally
comfortable in my own skin.

00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:02.884
So, I think you have to ask yourself --

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:06.055
I want people to be themselves,
whatever that is, just let it be.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:09.791
PM: And the first research
the Leadership Initiative did showed that,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:13.051
that these examples you just used --

00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:17.880
that many of us have the problem
of being authentic.

00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:21.929
But what you've just looked at
is this millennial generation,

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:25.491
who have benefited from all these
equal opportunities --

00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:27.676
which may not be equal
but exist everywhere --

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.419
BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:33.975
Partnership with Teneo,
a strategic company that's amazing.

00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:36.172
That's really the reason
I'm able to do this.

00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:37.978
I've had two times in my life

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:40.688
where I've actually had men
really behind me with power.

00:09:40.712 --> 00:09:44.002
And that was in the old days
with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:46.360
and this is the second time
in my entire life.

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:47.733
And then Deloitte.

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:51.942
The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.

00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:54.192
So Deloitte sent out a survey,

00:09:54.216 --> 00:09:58.221
and over 4,000 people now have answered,

00:09:58.245 --> 00:10:00.129
and we're continuing in the workplace.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.300
And what do the millennials feel?

00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:07.418
Well, they feel a lot, but what
they're so fantastic about is --

00:10:07.442 --> 00:10:10.971
you know, our generation was like,
"Oh, we're going to get representation."

00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:13.783
So if you walk into a room,
you see everybody represented.

00:10:13.807 --> 00:10:16.277
That's not good enough anymore,
which is so good!

00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:20.521
So the millennials are fantastic;
they want connection, engagement.

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:23.969
They just want you to tell us
what you're feeling, what you're thinking,

00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:25.246
and get into the solution.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.508
They're problem-solvers,

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:29.407
and of course, you've got
the information at your fingertips,

00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:32.133
compared to when I was growing up.

00:10:32.157 --> 00:10:34.685
PM: What did the research show you
about millennials?

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:36.428
Are they going to make a difference?

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:40.469
Are they going to create a world where
there is really an inclusive work force?

00:10:40.493 --> 00:10:46.385
BJK: Well, in 2025,
75 percent of the global workforce

00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:47.849
is going to be millennials.

00:10:48.202 --> 00:10:50.489
I think they are going
to help solve problems.

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:52.609
I think they have
the wherewithal to do it.

00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:54.204
I know they care a lot.

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:58.704
They have big ideas
and they can make big things happen.

00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:01.367
I want to stay in the now
with the young people,

00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:03.285
I don't want to get behind.

00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:06.344
(Laughter)

00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:08.174
PM: I don't think there's any chance!

00:11:09.604 --> 00:11:12.599
But what you found out
in the research about millennials

00:11:12.623 --> 00:11:17.250
is not really the experience that a lot
of people have with millennials.

00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:21.038
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --
OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.

00:11:21.062 --> 00:11:25.945
I've been talking to the Boomers,
who are their bosses, and I go,

00:11:25.969 --> 00:11:28.015
"What do you think about the millennials?"

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.915
And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.395
and they get this face --

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:33.735
(Laughter)

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.441
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:37.046
(Laughter)

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.558
I say, "Do you really think so?

00:11:38.582 --> 00:11:41.464
Because I do think they care
about the environment

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:42.783
and all these things."

00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:47.927
And they go, "Oh, Billie,
they cannot focus."

00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:50.653
(Laughter)

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.296
They actually have proven

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.814
that the average focus
for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.

00:11:55.838 --> 00:11:57.407
(Laughter)

00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:58.830
They can't focus.

00:11:58.854 --> 00:12:00.263
And they don't really care.

00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:02.128
I just heard a story the other night:

00:12:02.152 --> 00:12:04.582
a woman owns a gallery
and she has these workers.

00:12:05.547 --> 00:12:08.712
She gets a text from one of the workers,

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:11.384
like an intern, she's
just starting -- she goes,

00:12:11.408 --> 00:12:14.791
"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late
because I'm at the hairdresser's."

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:19.727
(Laughter)

00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.563
So she arrives, and this boss says,

00:12:23.587 --> 00:12:24.738
"What's going on?"

00:12:24.762 --> 00:12:27.288
And she says, "Oh, I was late,
sorry, how's it going?"

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:31.412
She says, "Well, guess what?
I'd like you leave, you're finished."

00:12:31.436 --> 00:12:32.802
She goes, "OK."

00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:36.028
(Laughter)

00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:37.203
No problem!

00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:38.649
PM: Now Billie, that story --

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:41.107
I know, but that's what
scares the boomers --

00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.994
I'm just telling you --
so I think it's good for us to share.

00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:45.587
(Laughter)

00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.094
No, it is good for us to share,

00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:50.187
because we're our authentic selves
and what we're really feeling,

00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:52.484
so we've got to take it
both ways, you know?

00:12:52.508 --> 00:12:54.455
But I have great faith because --

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:57.372
if you've been in sports like I have --

00:12:57.396 --> 00:12:59.029
every generation gets better.

00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:00.338
It's a fact.

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:04.371
With the Women's Sports Foundation
being the advocates for Title IX still,

00:13:04.395 --> 00:13:06.648
because we're trying
to keep protecting the law,

00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:09.817
because it's in a tenuous position always,

00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:11.721
so we really are concerned,

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.436
and we do a lot of research.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.134
That's very important to us.

00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:16.753
And I want to hear from people.

00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:22.856
But we really have to protect
what Title IX stands for worldwide.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.646
And you heard President Carter
talk about how Title IX is protected.

00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:32.192
And do you know that every single lawsuit

00:13:32.216 --> 00:13:35.734
that girls, at least in sports,
have gone up against --

00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:38.167
whatever institutions --

00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:39.592
has won?

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:41.747
Title IX is there to protect us.

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:43.788
And it is amazing.

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:47.788
But we still have to get
the hearts and minds --

00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:50.549
the hearts and minds
to match the legislation is huge.

00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:52.656
PM: So what gets you up every morning?

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.112
What keeps you sustaining your work,

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:58.334
sustaining the fight
for equality, extending it,

00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:01.789
always exploring new areas,
trying to find new ways ... ?

00:14:01.813 --> 00:14:05.583
BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy
because I was always the curious one.

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:08.422
I'm highly motivated.

00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:12.225
My younger brother was
a Major League Baseball player.

00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:15.296
My poor parents did not care
if we were any good.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.562
(Laughter)

00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:19.325
And we drove them crazy because we pushed,

00:14:19.349 --> 00:14:21.351
we pushed because
we wanted to be the best.

00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:29.413
And I think it's because of what
I'm hearing today in TED talks.

00:14:29.858 --> 00:14:33.514
I think to listen to these
different women,

00:14:33.538 --> 00:14:35.018
to listen to different people,

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:38.288
to listen to President Carter --
90 years old, by the way,

00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:41.784
and he we was throwing these figures
out that I would never --

00:14:41.808 --> 00:14:42.962
I'd have to go,

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:46.277
"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need
to get a list out of these figures."

00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:48.978
He was rattling off --
I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.329
PM: He's an amazing man.

00:14:51.353 --> 00:14:54.061
(Applause)

00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:57.477
BJK: And then you're going to have
President Mary Robinson,

00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.386
who's a former president --

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.292
Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:05.470
(Applause)

00:15:05.494 --> 00:15:08.911
Congress is voting in June
on same-sex marriage,

00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:12.871
so these are things that for some people
are very hard to hear.

00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:15.676
But always remember,
every one of us is an individual,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.372
a human being with a beating heart,

00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:21.524
who cares and wants to live
their authentic life.

00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:24.374
OK? You don't have to agree with somebody,

00:15:24.398 --> 00:15:26.111
but everyone has the opportunity.

00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:30.999
I think we all have an obligation

00:15:31.023 --> 00:15:35.887
to continue to keep moving
the needle forward, always.

00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:37.909
And these people have been so inspiring.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:39.863
Everyone matters.

00:15:39.887 --> 00:15:41.764
And every one of you is an influencer.

00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:45.198
You out there listening, out there
in the world, plus the people here --

00:15:45.222 --> 00:15:47.037
every single person's an influencer.

00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:49.579
Never, ever forget that. OK?

00:15:49.603 --> 00:15:51.923
So don't ever give up on yourself.

00:15:52.622 --> 00:15:54.900
PM: Billie, you have been
an inspiration for us.

00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:56.074
BJK: Thanks, Pat!

00:15:56.098 --> 00:15:59.913
(Applause)

00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:01.088
Thanks, TED!

00:16:01.112 --> 00:16:03.104
(Applause)

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.278
Thanks a lot!
