00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.285
When I was a young man, I spent six years

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.398
of wild adventure in the tropics

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:18.526
working as an investigative journalist

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:21.911
in some of the most bewitching parts of the world.

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.110
I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.648
This is why wars get fought.

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:30.875
But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:34.768
And when I came home, I found the scope of my existence

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.751
gradually diminishing

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:41.197
until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.

00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:43.337
And I found myself sort of

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.394
scratching at the walls of life,

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:47.432
as if I was trying to find a way out

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:49.319
into a wider space beyond.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.850
I was, I believe, ecologically bored.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.331
Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:03.157
in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:05.753
And we still possess the fear and the courage

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.946
and the aggression required to navigate those times.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:13.630
But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.613
we have few opportunities to exercise them

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:19.765
without harming other people.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.903
And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself

00:01:23.903 --> 00:01:26.153
bumping up against.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:28.765
To conquer uncertainty,

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.083
to know what comes next,

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:36.653
that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:40.253
and having got there, or almost got there,

00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:43.616
we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:46.618
We've privileged safety over experience

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:49.122
and we've gained a lot in doing so,

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.130
but I think we've lost something too.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.932
Now, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:58.450
I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.679
and the outcome of a mortal combat between me

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.592
myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:07.074
and an enraged giant aurochs

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:09.556
isn't very hard to predict.

00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:12.552
Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:15.692
I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:19.618
I just wanted a richer and rawer life

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:22.114
than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:25.526
that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:31.032
And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:34.637
that I began to understand what I was looking for.

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.291
And as soon as I found that word,

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.319
I realized that I wanted to devote

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.074
much of the rest of my life to it.

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:46.575
The word is "rewilding,"

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:49.357
and even though rewilding is a young word,

00:02:49.357 --> 00:02:51.224
it already has several definitions.

00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:55.260
But there are two in particular that fascinate me.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.211
The first one is the mass restoration

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:01.866
of ecosystems.

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:04.836
One of the most exciting scientific findings

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.606
of the past half century

00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:11.352
has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:14.530
A trophic cascade is an ecological process

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.905
which starts at the top of the food chain

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:20.200
and tumbles all the way down to the bottom,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.543
and the classic example is what happened

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:25.354
in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States

00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:29.443
when wolves were reintroduced in 1995.

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:33.878
Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:36.277
but perhaps we're slightly less aware

00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:40.115
that they give life to many others.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:43.228
It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.

00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:45.054
Before the wolves turned up,

00:03:45.054 --> 00:03:46.713
they'd been absent for 70 years.

00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:49.778
The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,

00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:52.532
had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.623
and despite efforts by humans to control them,

00:03:55.623 --> 00:03:58.318
they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.739
to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.934
But as soon as the wolves arrived,

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:05.761
even though they were few in number,

00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:09.660
they started to have the most remarkable effects.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.831
First, of course, they killed some of the deer,

00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.643
but that wasn't the major thing.

00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:15.674
Much more significantly,

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.873
they radically changed the behavior of the deer.

00:04:18.873 --> 00:04:21.786
The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:24.009
the places where they could be trapped most easily,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.748
particularly the valleys and the gorges,

00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:29.937
and immediately those places started to regenerate.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:32.336
In some areas, the height of the trees

00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:35.348
quintupled in just six years.

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:39.415
Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen

00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:41.686
and willow and cottonwood.

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:43.464
And as soon as that happened,

00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:45.622
the birds started moving in.

00:04:45.622 --> 00:04:48.043
The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:50.117
started to increase greatly.

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:52.174
The number of beavers started to increase,

00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:54.855
because beavers like to eat the trees.

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.083
And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.962
They create niches for other species.

00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:03.174
And the dams they built in the rivers

00:05:03.174 --> 00:05:06.108
provided habitats for otters and muskrats

00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:10.289
and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.394
The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:16.856
the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,

00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:19.766
which meant more hawks, more weasels,

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:22.165
more foxes, more badgers.

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:24.652
Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:26.888
on the carrion that the wolves had left.

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:30.597
Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:32.940
partly also because there were more berries

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.252
growing on the regenerating shrubs,

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:38.483
and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:42.882
by killing some of the calves of the deer.

00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:46.558
But here's where it gets really interesting.

00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:51.843
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:53.530
They began to meander less.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.153
There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.

00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:59.548
More pools formed, more riffle sections,

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:01.779
all of which were great for wildlife habitats.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.981
The rivers changed

00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:06.193
in response to the wolves,

00:06:06.193 --> 00:06:09.838
and the reason was that the regenerating forests

00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:13.529
stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.849
so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.576
Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:24.932
and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,

00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:26.345
there was less soil erosion,

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:29.881
because the vegetation stabilized that as well.

00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:33.242
So the wolves, small in number,

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:36.205
transformed not just the ecosystem

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:39.307
of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:43.525
but also its physical geography.

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.149
Whales in the southern oceans

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:47.652
have similarly wide-ranging effects.

00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:50.519
One of the many post-rational excuses

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:53.509
made by the Japanese government for killing whales

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.643
is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise

00:06:56.643 --> 00:06:58.881
and then there'll be more for people to eat."

00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.892
Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:02.261
kind of makes sense, doesn't it,

00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:04.385
because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts

00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:06.547
of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,

00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:08.609
there'll be more fish and krill.

00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:11.002
But the opposite happened.

00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:12.331
You take the whales away,

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.182
and the number of krill collapses.

00:07:15.182 --> 00:07:17.275
Why would that possibly have happened?

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.415
Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:23.728
to sustaining that entire ecosystem,

00:07:23.728 --> 00:07:25.457
and one of the reasons for this

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:27.557
is that they often feed at depth

00:07:27.557 --> 00:07:29.339
and then they come up to the surface and produce

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:33.525
what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,

00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:37.958
huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.274
up in the photic zone, where there's enough light

00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:44.446
to allow photosynthesis to take place,

00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:47.390
and those great plumes of fertilizer

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.382
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

00:07:49.382 --> 00:07:51.296
the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:53.394
which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:55.691
which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.825
The other thing that whales do is that,

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.554
as they're plunging up and down through the water column,

00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:02.922
they're kicking the phytoplankton

00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:04.372
back up towards the surface

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.486
where it can continue to survive and reproduce.

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.114
And interestingly, well, we know

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:13.051
that plant plankton in the oceans

00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:14.858
absorb carbon from the atmosphere --

00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:16.401
the more plant plankton there are,

00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.080
the more carbon they absorb --

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.162
and eventually they filter down into the abyss

00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:24.542
and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:28.843
Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,

00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:31.852
they were probably responsible for sequestering

00:08:31.852 --> 00:08:35.645
some tens of millions of tons of carbon

00:08:35.645 --> 00:08:38.334
every year from the atmosphere.

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:41.561
And when you look at it like that, you think,

00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:43.420
wait a minute, here are the wolves

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.437
changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.

00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:48.296
Here are the whales changing

00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:50.936
the composition of the atmosphere.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:53.246
You begin to see that possibly,

00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:56.927
the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,

00:08:56.927 --> 00:08:59.514
which conceives of the world as a coherent,

00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:01.444
self-regulating organism,

00:09:01.444 --> 00:09:07.178
is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.

00:09:07.178 --> 00:09:09.446
Trophic cascades

00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:11.507
tell us that the natural world

00:09:11.507 --> 00:09:16.253
is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.

00:09:16.253 --> 00:09:19.985
They tell us that when you take away the large animals,

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:23.177
you are left with a radically different ecosystem

00:09:23.177 --> 00:09:26.349
to one which retains its large animals.

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:29.630
And they make, in my view, a powerful case

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.783
for the reintroduction of missing species.

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:35.859
Rewilding, to me,

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:39.157
means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.

00:09:39.157 --> 00:09:40.469
It means taking down the fences,

00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:42.493
it means blocking the drainage ditches,

00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:45.757
it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,

00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:49.171
but otherwise stepping back.

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:52.981
It has no view as to what a right ecosystem

00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:55.682
or a right assemblage of species looks like.

00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:59.461
It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow

00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:04.147
or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.

00:10:04.147 --> 00:10:06.164
It lets nature decide,

00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:09.983
and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.

00:10:09.983 --> 00:10:12.258
Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:14.104
of rewilding that interest me.

00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:15.361
The other one

00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:18.384
is the rewilding of human life.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.447
And I don't see this as an alternative

00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:22.371
to civilization.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.771
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,

00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.610
as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.626
have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:36.209
when we want to because

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:40.605
there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:42.389
And the opportunities for this

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:47.380
are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.359
There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:54.044
two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared

00:10:54.044 --> 00:10:57.547
has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,

00:10:57.547 --> 00:11:00.560
particularly from the eastern half of the country.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.217
There's another one which suggests

00:11:02.217 --> 00:11:05.680
that 30 million hectares of land in Europe,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.187
an area the size of Poland,

00:11:08.187 --> 00:11:10.018
will be vacated by farmers

00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:13.340
between 2000 and 2030.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.876
Now, faced with opportunities like that,

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:19.047
does it not seem a little unambitious

00:11:19.047 --> 00:11:22.761
to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,

00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.360
bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.185
and all the other species which are already beginning

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:31.449
to move quite rapidly across Europe?

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:33.973
Perhaps we should also start thinking

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:37.962
about the return of some of our lost megafauna.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.894
What megafauna, you say?

00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:42.463
Well, every continent had one,

00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:43.944
apart from Antarctica.

00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:47.582
When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.337
the river gravels there were found

00:11:49.337 --> 00:11:52.887
to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,

00:11:52.887 --> 00:11:56.975
rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:58.349
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:58.349 --> 00:12:00.545
there were lions in Trafalgar Square

00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.751
long before Nelson's Column was built.

00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:06.002
All these species lived here

00:12:06.002 --> 00:12:08.654
in the last interglacial period,

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:11.515
when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.

00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:13.588
It's not climate, largely,

00:12:13.588 --> 00:12:17.135
which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:19.239
It's pressure from the human population

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.075
hunting and destroying their habitats

00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:23.126
which has done so.

00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:26.914
And even so, you can still see the shadows

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:29.622
of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.

00:12:29.622 --> 00:12:32.575
Why is it that so many deciduous trees

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:37.133
are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:39.202
Why is it that they can withstand the loss

00:12:39.202 --> 00:12:40.809
of so much of their bark?

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:43.752
Why do understory trees,

00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:48.845
which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind

00:12:48.845 --> 00:12:50.576
and have to carry less weight

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:52.978
than the big canopy trees,

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:56.097
why are they so much tougher and harder to break

00:12:56.097 --> 00:13:00.506
than the canopy trees are?

00:13:00.506 --> 00:13:02.478
Elephants.

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:04.647
They are elephant-adapted.

00:13:04.647 --> 00:13:06.935
In Europe, for example,

00:13:06.935 --> 00:13:10.078
they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:12.366
elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:14.542
It was related to the Asian elephant,

00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:17.111
but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.

00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:19.641
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.

00:13:19.641 --> 00:13:22.458
But why is it that some of our common shrubs

00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:25.642
have spines which seem to be over-engineered

00:13:25.642 --> 00:13:28.305
to resist browsing by deer?

00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:30.119
Perhaps because they evolved

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:33.382
to resist browsing by rhinoceros.

00:13:33.382 --> 00:13:35.306
Isn't it an amazing thought

00:13:35.306 --> 00:13:38.034
that every time you wander into a park

00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:40.881
or down an avenue or through a leafy street,

00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:44.492
you can see the shadows of these great beasts?

00:13:44.492 --> 00:13:48.292
Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,

00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:52.350
crucial to an understanding of our own,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.927
feels like a portal through which you may pass

00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:58.859
into an enchanted kingdom.

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:02.672
And if we really are looking at areas of land

00:14:02.672 --> 00:14:06.917
of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.632
why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:11.582
or at least species closely related to those

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:14.543
which have become extinct everywhere?

00:14:14.543 --> 00:14:16.852
Why shouldn't all of us

00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:19.805
have a Serengeti on our doorsteps?

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:22.771
And perhaps this is the most important thing

00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:24.246
that rewilding offers us,

00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:27.840
the most important thing that's missing from our lives:

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.957
hope.

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:34.354
In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,

00:14:34.354 --> 00:14:39.164
an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.

00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:41.803
The story rewilding tells us

00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:45.443
is that ecological change need not always proceed

00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:47.906
in one direction.

00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:50.342
It offers us the hope

00:14:50.342 --> 00:14:52.483
that our silent spring

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:54.814
could be replaced by a raucous summer.

00:14:54.814 --> 00:14:56.034
Thank you.

00:14:56.034 --> 00:15:02.045
(Applause)
