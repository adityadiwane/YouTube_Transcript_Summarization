00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
We've got a real problem with math education right now.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Basically, no one's very happy.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Those learning it

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
think it's disconnected,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
uninteresting and hard.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Those trying to employ them

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
think they don't know enough.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
but don't know how to fix it.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And teachers are also frustrated.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Yet math is more important to the world

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
than at any point in human history.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
So at one end we've got falling interest

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in education in math,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
a more quantitative world than we ever have had.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
and what can we do to fix it?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Well actually, I think the answer

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
is staring us right in the face:

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Use computers.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
I believe

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
that correctly using computers

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
is the silver bullet

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
for making math education work.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So to explain that,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and what it looks like in education.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
See, in the real world

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
It's done by geologists,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
engineers, biologists,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
all sorts of different people --

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
modeling and simulation.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
It's actually very popular.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
But in education it looks very different --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
mostly by hand.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Lots of things that seem simple

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and not difficult like in the real world,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
except if you're learning it.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And another thing about math:

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
math sometimes looks like math --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
like in this example here --

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and sometimes it doesn't --

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
like "Am I drunk?"

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
But now you can find out all about --

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
all about what happens.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So let's zoom out a bit and ask,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
why are we teaching people math?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
What's the point of teaching people math?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Why is it such an important part of education

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
as a sort of compulsory subject?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Well, I think there are about three reasons:

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
technical jobs

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
so critical to the development of our economies,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
what I call "everyday living" --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
to function in the world today,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
you've got to be pretty quantitative,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
much more so than a few years ago:

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
figure out your mortgages,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and thirdly, what I would call something like

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
logical mind training, logical thinking.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Over the years

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
we've put so much in society

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
It's very important to learn that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
math is a great way to do that.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So let's ask another question.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
What is math?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
What do we mean when we say we're doing math,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
or educating people to do math?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
starting with posing the right question.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
beyond virtually any other part of doing math.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
People ask the wrong question,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
for that reason, if not for others.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So the next thing is take that problem

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and turn it from a real world problem

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
into a math problem.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
That's stage two.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Turn it from that into some answer

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
in a mathematical form.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Did it answer the question?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And also verify it -- crucial step.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Now here's the crazy thing right now.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
In math education,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
teaching people to do step three by hand.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Yet, that's the one step computers can do

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
better than any human after years of practice.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Instead, we ought to be using computers

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
to do step three

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and using the students to spend much more effort

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
on learning how to do steps one, two and four --

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
conceptualizing problems, applying them,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
See, crucial point here:

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
math is not equal to calculating.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
over hundreds of years.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
But in the last few decades

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
that has totally changed.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
that I could ever imagine with computers.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Calculating was typically the limiting step,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
and now often it isn't.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
So I think in terms of the fact that math

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
has been liberated from calculating.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
See, I think of calculating, in a sense,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
as the machinery of math.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
It's the chore.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
and automation allows us

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to have that machinery.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Computers allow us to do that --

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and this is not a small problem by any means.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I estimated that, just today, across the world,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
we spent about 106 average world lifetimes

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
teaching people how to calculate by hand.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
So we better be damn sure --

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
so we better be damn sure

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that we know why we're doing that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and it has a real purpose.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I think we should be assuming computers

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
for doing the calculating

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And I think there are some cases.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
For example: mental arithmetic.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
People say, "Is such and such true?"

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So I think practicality is one case

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
where it's worth teaching people by hand.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And then there are certain conceptual things

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that can also benefit from hand calculating,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
but I think they're relatively small in number.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
One thing I often ask about

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
is ancient Greek and how this relates.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
See, the thing we're doing right now

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
It's a major subject.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
or in following their own interests

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
in any subject however bizarre --

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
they should do that.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
That's absolutely the right thing,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
for people to follow their self-interest.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
but I don't think that we should force the entire population

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to learn a subject like ancient Greek.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I don't think it's warranted.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
and the subject that's sort of mainstream

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So what are the issues people bring up with this?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
You shouldn't use the machine

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
until you get the basics of the subject.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Basics of what?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Are the basics of driving a car

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
I don't think so.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
from how it gets done

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and the machinery of how it gets done

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and automation allows you to make that separation.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
But automation in cars

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
allowed that to separate,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
from engineering of the car

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
or learning how to service it.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
So automation allows this separation

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and also allows -- in the case of driving,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and I believe also in the future case of maths --

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
a democratized way of doing that.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
It can be spread across a much larger number of people

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
who can really work with that.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
So there's another thing that comes up with basics.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
People confuse, in my view,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
the order of the invention of the tools

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
with the order in which they should use them for teaching.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So just because paper was invented before computers,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
by using paper instead of a computer

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
to teach mathematics.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
(Laughter)

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
I didn't make these.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Why do you think that was?"

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
she said, "No paper?"

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
(Laughter)

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
If you were born after computers and paper,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
you just want to have the best tool.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
That somehow, if you use a computer,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
it's all mindless button-pushing,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
but if you do it by hand,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
it's all intellectual.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
This one kind of annoys me, I must say.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
Do we really believe

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
that the math that most people are doing in school

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
practically today

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
is more than applying procedures

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I don't think so.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
actually make it more conceptual.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Now, of course, like any great tool,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
they can be used completely mindlessly,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
like turning everything into a multimedia show,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
where the computer was the teacher --

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
This is just nuts.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that the computer should be doing anyway?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
All backwards.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Let me show you

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that you can also make problems harder to calculate.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
See, normally in school,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
you do things like solve quadratic equations.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
But you see, when you're using a computer,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
you can just substitute.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Same principles applied --

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
calculations, harder.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And problems in the real world

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
look nutty and horrible like this.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
They've got hair all over them.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And think of the outside world.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
Do we really believe that engineering and biology

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
and all of these other things

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
that have so benefited from computers and maths

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So the problem we've really got in math education

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
is not that computers might dumb it down,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Well, another issue people bring up

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
is somehow that hand calculating procedures

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
teach understanding.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
So if you go through lots of examples,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
you can get the answer,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
you can understand how the basics of the system work better.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
It's called programming.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Programming is how most procedures and processes

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
get written down these days,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and it's also a great way

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
to engage students much more

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and to check they really understand.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
If you really want to check you understand math

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
then write a program to do it.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
is we have a unique opportunity

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
to make maths both more practical

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and more conceptual, simultaneously.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It's usually some kind of choice

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
between the vocational and the intellectual.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
But I think we can do both at the same time here.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And we open up so many more possibilities.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
You can do so many more problems.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
What I really think we gain from this

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
is students getting intuition and experience

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And experience of harder problems --

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
being able to play with the math, interact with it,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
feel it.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
We want people who can feel the math instinctively.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
That's what computers allow us to do.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
but now we can reorder it

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
however hard the calculating.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Why is this?

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
But actually many of the concepts

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
are amenable to a much younger age group.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
This was an example I built for my daughter.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
And very, very simple.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
We were talking about what happens

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
to a very large number.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And of course, it turns into a circle.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And by the way, she was also very insistent

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
on being able to change the color,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
an important feature for this demonstration.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
You can see that this is a very early step

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
into limits and differential calculus

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and what happens when you take things to an extreme --

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
and very small sides and a very large number of sides.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Very simple example.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
That's a view of the world

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
So one of the roadblocks we have

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
in moving this agenda forward

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
is exams.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
to a point where they can use computers

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
during the semesters.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
And one of the reasons it's so important --

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
so it's very important to get computers in exams.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And then we can ask questions, real questions,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
real questions that people have in their everyday lives.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
How many years of protection do I need?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
What does that do to the payments

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and to the interest rates and so forth?

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
that should be asked in exams,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
but I think it's a very important type

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
that right now just gets completely ignored

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and is critical for people's real understanding.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
So I believe [there is] critical reform

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
we have to do in computer-based math.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
We have got to make sure

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
that we can move our economies forward,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
and also our societies,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
This isn't some optional extra.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And the country that does this first

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
will, in my view, leapfrog others

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
in achieving a new economy even,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
an improved economy,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
an improved outlook.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
In fact, I even talk about us moving

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
from what we often call now the "knowledge economy"

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
where high-level math is integral to what everyone does

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
in the way that knowledge currently is.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
We can engage so many more students with this,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
and they can have a better time doing it.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And let's understand:

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
this is not an incremental sort of change.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
We're trying to cross the chasm here

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
between school math and the real-world math.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
And you know if you walk across a chasm,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
bigger disaster.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
No, what I'm suggesting

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
is that we should leap off,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
we should increase our velocity

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
so it's high,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
and we should leap off one side and go the other --

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
(Laughter)

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
So I want to see

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
a completely renewed, changed math curriculum

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
built from the ground up,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
based on computers being there,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
computers that are now ubiquitous almost.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
Calculating machines are everywhere

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
but what I am sure is

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
it's the mainstream subject of the future.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
Let's go for it,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
and while we're about it,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
let's have a bit of fun,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
for us, for the students and for TED here.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
Thanks.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:12.260
(Applause)
