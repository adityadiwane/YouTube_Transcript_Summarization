00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.330
require a certain kind of intellectual activity,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
because you are always comparing the variation

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
with the theme that you hold in your mind.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
You might say that the theme is nature

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:54.330
I was asked, I guess about six years ago,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
to do a series of paintings

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.330
that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
And it was very difficult for me to imagine

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:19.330
how to paint pictures that were based on Piero

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.330
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And that was enormously liberating to me.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.330
but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
based on a work by Piero,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.330
in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
who faces his consort, Battista.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
I did the following series of drawings.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
That's the real Piero della Francesca --

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
one of the greatest portraits in human history.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
And these, I'll just show these without comment.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.330
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
He apparently lost an eye in battle,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
which is why he is always shown in profile.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
And this is Battista.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.330
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
Whoops! Passed each other.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" --

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.330
as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
And now, four large panels:

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
this is upper left;

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
upper right;

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
lower left;

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
lower right.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.330
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
there doesn't seem to be an argument there.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
On another subject --

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
(Laughter) --

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
I was driving in the country one day with my wife,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and I saw this sign,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
And she said, "What are you talking about?"

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.330
because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and since most people are so suspicious of garages,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
and know that they're going to be ripped off,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
they use the word 'reliable.'

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
But everybody says they're reliable.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
But, reliable Dutchman" --

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
(Laughter) --

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
"Fantastic!"

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore --

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
but as soon as you hear Dutchman,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:06.330
(Laughter)

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Or even "French."

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.330
(Laughter)

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.330
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
(Laughter)

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.330
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes --

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
And so he did.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Alike fantastic if too new or old/

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Be not the first by whom the new are tried/

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
I could make nothing of that.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
And I really struggled with this one.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.330
and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
So I took another crack at it --

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
you've got to keep it moving --

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
and I pasted them down on an ugly board.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
I thought that something would come out of it,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
because it's by Alexander Pope,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
but I sort of made a mess out of it,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
So, it was going nowhere.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
I write down things that I know about it.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
But you can see the beginning of an idea there,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
That's what happens.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
There's a relationship between the old and the new;

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
the new emerges from the context of the old.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
And then I did some variations of it,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.330
but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
I had this other version which had something interesting about it

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.330
in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
even though they were very fragmentary

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
and there wasn't a lot of information in it.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
Then I got the words "new" and "old"

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.330
and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
(Laughter)

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
I was really desperate at this point.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.330
and I put them together.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
It says "dreams" at the top.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
But, to my credit,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
I was so embarrassed about doing that

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
that I never submitted this sketch.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.330
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
but it does have something

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.330
that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:34.330
which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:50.330
(Laughter)

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.330
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:01.330
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.330
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
This one generates no imagery at all."

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Which is something you never want to do professionally.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.330
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
What's the heart of this poem?

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
I guess one could reduce the idea further

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
like this."

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
And then I show you a little drawing --

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.330
you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
Well, I found a way to use it.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
So, there's that little alternative over there,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.330
and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself --

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
"but more didactic than visual.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
a kind of dance where each defines the other."

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.330
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.330
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
There's a significant difference.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
This could be embarrassing.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.330
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:21.330
(Laughter)

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:33.330
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:39.330
and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
And as you know, you have to have a front.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
I mean -- you've got to be confident;

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
So that's one thing,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.330
to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
That can be a big contribution.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
you get the big one

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
and if you don't like that, how about the little one?

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
(Laughter)

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
And that too is a relatively new idea.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
And here's just a series of experiments

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.330
where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
Now, this is a little illusion.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
That poster is not folded.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
It's not folded, that's a photograph

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
and it's cut on the diagonal.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
And here,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
a very peculiar poster because,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.330
simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
it won't sit still in the space.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and then it shifts.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.330
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
But, we don't have time.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.330
(Laughter)

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
And then an experiment --

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
a little bit about the nature of perspective,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.330
where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.330
but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
is seen frontally.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.330
And another piece for the art directors' club

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.330
is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.330
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
and I didn't want to be embarrassed,

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
so I worked very hard on this.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.330
so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
all of which had a different idea of what art is.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.330
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is"

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.330
and trying to determine what art was.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.330
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
And as soon as I said that,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.330
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
in case you don't get it.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
(Laughter)

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
Now this says, "Note to the viewer:

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
surrealism has become banal,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
a shadow of its former self.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.330
The phrase 'Art is whatever'

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making --

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.330
a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
hidden in the word 'whatever.'

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.330
as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
and the shape of the thing.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
Whatever."

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.330
(Applause)

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.330
OK.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:22.330
(Applause)

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
And the one that I did not submit,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
which I still like,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
I wanted to use the same phrase.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:35.330
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
on letterforms some years ago --

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
And that idea stuck in my head.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.330
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.330
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
But what really happens is that you read it as:

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
"Art is whatever remains."

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.330
Thank you.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:08.330
(Applause)
