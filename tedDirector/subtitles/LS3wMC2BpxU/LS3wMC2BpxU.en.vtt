00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Our mission is to build

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
a detailed, realistic

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
computer model of the human brain.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
And we've done, in the past four years,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
a proof of concept

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
on a small part of the rodent brain,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
to reach the human brain.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
Why are we doing this?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
There are three important reasons.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
if we do want to get along in society,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and I think that it is a key step in evolution.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
The second reason is,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.330
we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
into a working model.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.330
It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
that are affected by mental disorder,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
and the drugs that are used today

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
are largely empirical.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
how to treat disorders.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
Now, even at this stage,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
we can use the brain model

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
to explore some fundamental questions

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
about how the brain works.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And here, at TED, for the first time,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
I'd like to share with you how we're addressing

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
one theory -- there are many theories --

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
one theory of how the brain works.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.330
So, this theory is that the brain

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.330
creates, builds, a version of the universe,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
and projects this version of the universe,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.330
like a bubble, all around us.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
But, for the first time, we can actually address this,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
with brain simulation,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
and ask very systematic and rigorous questions,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.330
whether this theory could possibly be true.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
is simply because our perceptual bubble

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.330
does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
It runs out of space.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
And so what we do is we compare the buildings

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
within our perceptual bubble,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and we make a decision.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
We make a decision it's that big,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
even though it's not that big.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And what that illustrates

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
is that decisions are the key things

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
you cannot feel.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
And you may think that anesthetics work

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
by sending you into some deep sleep,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
What they do is they introduce a noise

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
They are confused,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
and you cannot make a decision.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
So, while you're trying to make up your mind

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
He's at home having tea.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
(Laughter)

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
So, when you walk up to a door and you open it,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
what you compulsively have to do to perceive

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
is to make decisions,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
thousands of decisions about the size of the room,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
the walls, the height, the objects in this room.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
99 percent of what you see

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
is not what comes in through the eyes.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.330
It is what you infer about that room.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.330
So I can say, with some certainty,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
"I think, therefore I am."

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
because "you" are within my perceptual bubble.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
Now, we can speculate and philosophize this,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
We can ask a very concrete question.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
"Can the brain build such a perception?"

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
Is it capable of doing it?

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Does it have the substance to do it?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
It had to improve it a little bit.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
because they had to cope on land.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
But the real big step was the neocortex.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
It's a new brain. You needed it.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
The mammals needed it

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330
because they had to cope with parenthood,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
social interactions,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
complex cognitive functions.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
So, you can think of the neocortex

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.330
actually as the ultimate solution today,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
of the universe as we know it.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
It's the pinnacle, it's the final product

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
that the universe has produced.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
It was so successful in evolution

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
that from mouse to man it expanded

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
to produce this almost frightening

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
organ, structure.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
In fact, the neocortex in the human brain

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
is evolving at an enormous speed.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
you discover that it's made up of little modules,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
G5 processors, like in a computer.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.330
But there are about a million of them.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
They were so successful in evolution

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
that what we did was to duplicate them

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
over and over and add more and more of them to the brain

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
until we ran out of space in the skull.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
And the brain started to fold in on itself,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
We're just packing in columns,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
so that we'd have more neocortical columns

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
to perform more complex functions.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
So you can think of the neocortex actually as

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
a massive grand piano,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
a million-key grand piano.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
Each of these neocortical columns

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
would produce a note.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
You stimulate it; it produces a symphony.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
But it's not just a symphony of perception.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
It's a symphony of your universe, your reality.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Now, of course it takes years to learn how

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
to master a grand piano with a million keys.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
That's why you have to send your kids to good schools,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
hopefully eventually to Oxford.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
But it's not only education.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
It's also genetics.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
You may be born lucky,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.330
where you know how to master your neocortical column,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
and you can play a fantastic symphony.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
In fact, there is a new theory of autism

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
called the "intense world" theory,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.330
and so the autists are probably capable of

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
building and learning a symphony

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
which is unthinkable for us.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
But you can also understand

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
that if you have a disease

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
within one of these columns,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
the note is going to be off.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
The perception, the symphony that you create

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
is going to be corrupted,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
and you will have symptoms of disease.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.330
is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and it's not just for neuroscience;

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
So, what we did was, for the past 15 years,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.330
was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330
It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
How many trees does it have?

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
What shapes are the trees?

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.330
describe and discover all the rules of communication,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.330
the rules of connectivity,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
They choose very carefully who they connect with.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
It's also more than cataloging

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.330
because you actually have to build three-dimensional

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
digital models of them.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.330
built digital models of all the different types

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
of neurons we came across.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
And once you have that, you can actually

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.330
begin to build the neocortical column.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
And here we're coiling them up.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
But as you do this, what you see

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
is that the branches intersect

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
actually in millions of locations,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
and at each of these intersections

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
they can form a synapse.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
And a synapse is a chemical location

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
where they communicate with each other.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And these synapses together

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
form the network

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
or the circuit of the brain.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
the fabric of the brain.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
And when you think of the fabric of the brain,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
You realize that this poses

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and especially to a theory that says

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
that there is some reality that emerges

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
with a particular pattern.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
is diversity.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
Every neuron is different.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
You may have many different types of trees,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
in exactly the same way.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
And you may have more or less neurons.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
So it's very unlikely

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
So, how could we possibly create a reality

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
that we can even understand each other?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
Well, we don't have to speculate.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
We can look at all 10 million synapses now.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
We can use different neurons with different variations.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
We can position them in different places,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
orient them in different places.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
We can use less or more of them.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
And when we do that

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:41.330
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
So, the fabric of the brain,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
even though your brain may be smaller, bigger,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
it may have different types of neurons,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
different morphologies of neurons,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
we actually do share

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
the same fabric.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
And we think this is species-specific,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
which means that that could explain

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
why we can't communicate across species.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
is you have to make this come alive.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
We make it come alive

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
with equations, a lot of mathematics.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.330
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
We also have the mathematics to describe

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
how neurons collect information,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and how they create a little lightning bolt

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
to communicate with each other.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.330
And when they get to the synapse,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
what they do is they effectively,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
literally, shock the synapse.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
It's like electrical shock

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
that releases the chemicals from these synapses.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
And we've got the mathematics to describe this process.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
So we can describe the communication between the neurons.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
There literally are only a handful

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
of equations that you need to simulate

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
the activity of the neocortex.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.330
But what you do need is a very big computer.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
And in fact you need one laptop

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
to do all the calculations just for one neuron.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
So you need 10,000 laptops.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
So where do you go? You go to IBM,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.330
10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
We can load up all the neurons,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
each one on to its processor,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.330
and fire it up, and see what happens.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
Take the magic carpet for a ride.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
of what is happening in your brain

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
when there is a stimulation.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
It's the first view.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
Now, when you look at that the first time, you think,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.330
"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
But, in fact, you can start,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
even though we haven't trained this neocortical column

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
to create a specific reality.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
We can ask, "Where is it inside,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
if we stimulate it with a picture?"

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Where is it inside the neocortex?

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.330
Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
So, the way that we can look at that

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
and look just at the raw electrical activity.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
Because that is what it's creating.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
It's creating electrical patterns.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
So when we did this,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
we indeed, for the first time,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
saw these ghost-like structures:

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
electrical objects appearing

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
within the neocortical column.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
And it's these electrical objects

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
that are holding all the information about

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.330
whatever stimulated it.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
And then when we zoomed into this,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.330
it's like a veritable universe.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
So the next step

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.330
is just to take these brain coordinates

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.330
and to project them into perceptual space.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
And if you do that,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
you will be able to step inside

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
the reality that is created

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.330
by this machine,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
by this piece of the brain.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
So, in summary,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
I think that the universe may have --

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
it's possible --

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
evolved a brain to see itself,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:22.330
which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
There is a lot more to do to test these theories,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
and to test any other theories.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
that it is not impossible to build a brain.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.330
We can do it within 10 years,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.330
and if we do succeed,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
we will send to TED, in 10 years,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:48.330
(Applause)
