00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
This is an example of a real meteorite,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
and you can see all the melting of the iron

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
and just how much of it survives and melts.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
From a meteorite from space,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
we’re over here with an original Sputnik.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.330
This is not a copy.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
The space age began 50 years ago in October,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
without seeing a flag that was carried

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
The astronauts each got to carry

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
about ten silk flags in their personal kits.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
They would bring them back and mount them.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
So this has actually been carried to the moon

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
and back.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
So that’s for fun.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
The dawn of books is, of course, important.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
in 1455.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
is not the book.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
You see, the book was not driven by reading.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
In 1455, nobody could read.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
So why did the printing press succeed?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
using movable type in the history of man,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
550 years ago.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
We are living at the age here at the end of the book,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
It turns out that in the 1450s,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
the Catholic Church needed money,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
and so they

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
They traveled all around Europe

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
They got you out of purgatory faster.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And when the printing press was invented

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
what they found was they could print indulgences,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
which was the equivalent of printing money.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
to print out thousands,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.330
and then hundreds of thousands,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and then ultimately millions

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
of single, small pieces of paper

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
That is why the printing press succeeded,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and that is why Martin Luther

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
nailed his 90 theses to the door:

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
in printing out indulgences and selling them

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
and had nothing to do with reading.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
for those of you that have asked for pictures.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
We’re going to have some tomorrow.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.330
(Applause)

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Instead of showing an object from the stage

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
I’m going to do something special for the first time.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
You’re going to find out why in a minute,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
because when I went to see Eileen,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
this is what I said I wanted to build.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
This is the Library of Human Imagination.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
The room itself is three stories tall.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
that are computer controlled.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
It’s designed like an Escher print.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Here is some of the lower level of the library,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
where the exhibits constantly change.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
You can walk through. You can touch.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
There’s my very own Saturn V.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
So you can see here in the lower level of the library

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
the books and the objects.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
There is a glass bridge that you walk across

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
that’s suspended in space.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.330
So it’s a leap of imagination.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
How do we create?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Part of the question that I have answered is,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
with human achievement, with history,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
with the things that drive us and make us human --

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
the maps of space that we’ve experienced,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.330
and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330
one or two more objects from the stage,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
but for today I just wanted to say thank you

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
for all the people that came and talked to us about it.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
and share it with the TED community.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.330
(Applause)

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
TED is all about patterns in the clouds.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
It’s all about connections.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
It’s all about seeing things

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
that everybody else has seen before

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.330
but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
For example, we can look

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
at a DNA molecule model here.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
None of us really have ever seen one,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
but we know it exists because we’ve been taught

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
to understand this molecule.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
But we can also look at an Enigma machine

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
from the Nazis in World War II

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
that was a coding and decoding machine.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
Well, this is the code for life,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
and this is a code for death.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
These two molecules

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
code and decode.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.330
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
But once you’ve seen them in a new way,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
you realize that both of these things really are connected.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.330
You see, this is a human brain model, OK?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
We get to see a skull. But there it is.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
All of imagination -- everything that we think,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
And once we create new patterns in this brain,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
once we shape the brain in a new way,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
it never returns to its original shape.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
And I’ll give you a quick example.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
We think about the Internet;

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
we think about information that goes across the Internet.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
And we never think about the hidden connection.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
But I brought along here a lump of coal --

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
right here, one lump of coal.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.330
to move one megabyte of information across the net.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
So every time you download a file,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
each megabyte is a lump of coal.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
looks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
So the next time you download a gigabyte,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330
or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.330
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
and to make everything we think possible, possible.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Thanks, Chris.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
(Applause)
