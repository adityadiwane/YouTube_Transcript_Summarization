00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:17.027
When I was about three or four years old,

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:20.909
I remember my mum reading a story to me

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.624
and my two big brothers,

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.643
and I remember putting up my hands

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:27.646
to feel the page of the book,

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:31.177
to feel the picture they were discussing.

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:33.626
And my mum said, "Darling,

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.479
remember that you can't see

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.525
and you can't feel the picture

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.462
and you can't feel the print on the page."

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.236
And I thought to myself,

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:46.131
"But that's what I want to do.

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:50.292
I love stories. I want to read."

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:52.554
Little did I know

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.073
that I would be part of a technological revolution

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:58.774
that would make that dream come true.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:02.191
I was born premature by about 10 weeks,

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:06.836
which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:09.706
The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:13.591
and it's now very rare in the developed world.

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.500
Little did I know, lying curled up

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.293
in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948

00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:24.121
that I'd been born at the right place

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.686
and the right time,

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.570
that I was in a country where I could participate

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.503
in the technological revolution.

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:38.944
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:42.168
but those of us who've shared in the technological changes

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.172
mainly come from North America, Europe,

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:49.597
Japan and other developed parts of the world.

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:52.770
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.673
and around the world,

00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:55.340
but I think they've changed the lives

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.883
of we blind people more than any other group.

00:01:58.883 --> 00:02:02.161
And so I want to tell you about the interaction

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.213
between computer-based adaptive technology

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:09.875
and the many volunteers who helped me over the years

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:13.276
to become the person I am today.

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:15.910
It's an interaction between volunteers,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.831
passionate inventors and technology,

00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.766
and it's a story that many other blind people could tell.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:26.181
But let me tell you a bit about it today.

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:30.007
When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.

00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.531
It's an ingenious system of six dots

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:34.265
that are punched into paper,

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:37.652
and I can feel them with my fingers.

00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:40.828
In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.553
I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:45.109
(Laughter)

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.930
I was pretty good in reading,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.890
but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.366
(Laughter)

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.453
When you leave the opera house,

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:58.862
you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:02.579
Look for it. Have you noticed it?

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.309
I do. I look for it all the time.

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.395
(Laughter)

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.734
When I was at school,

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:13.026
the books were transcribed by transcribers,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.859
voluntary people who punched one dot at a time

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.527
so I'd have volumes to read,

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:19.986
and that had been going on, mainly by women,

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:22.659
since the late 19th century in this country,

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.143
but it was the only way I could read.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:27.537
When I was in high school,

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:31.343
I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:34.732
and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:36.912
medium of learning.

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:40.051
I could have family and friends read me material,

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:42.444
and I could then read it back

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:45.000
as many times as I needed.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.520
And it brought me into contact

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.530
with volunteers and helpers.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.022
For example, when I studied at graduate school

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:55.259
at Queen's University in Canada,

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.342
the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:02.147
I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:03.433
As one of them said to me,

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.192
"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.653
(Laughter)

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.958
But think of it. These men,

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.905
who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:19.181
helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law

00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.600
by their dedicated help.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.961
Well, I went back and became an academic

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:27.603
at Melbourne's Monash University,

00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:31.113
and for those 25 years,

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:33.926
tape recorders were everything to me.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:36.377
In fact, in my office in 1990,

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:40.904
I had 18 miles of tape.

00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:47.809
Students, family and friends all read me material.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.346
Mrs. Lois Doery,

00:04:49.346 --> 00:04:52.324
whom I later came to call my surrogate mum,

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.976
read me many thousands of hours onto tape.

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:58.440
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.929
was that I was hoping that Lois would be here

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:04.966
so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:08.715
But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.

00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:13.303
But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.

00:05:13.303 --> 00:05:20.291
(Applause)

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:32.635
I saw my first Apple computer in 1984,

00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:34.160
and I thought to myself,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.128
"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."

00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:43.182
How very wrong I was.

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:47.715
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:50.169
I got my first blind computer,

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.383
and it's actually here.

00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:55.318
See it up there?

00:05:55.318 --> 00:05:59.601
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.919
(Laughter)

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.913
It's a blind computer.

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:07.813
(Laughter)

00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:10.418
It's a Keynote Gold 84k,

00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:14.594
and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.

00:06:14.594 --> 00:06:17.495
(Laughter)

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:22.433
Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:27.127
I think there's more memory in my watch.

00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:30.147
It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor

00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:32.945
in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.

00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:36.747
Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,

00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:39.605
but his memory lives on in my heart.

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:41.857
It meant, for the first time,

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:45.188
I could read back what I had typed into it.

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:47.145
It had a speech synthesizer.

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:49.405
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book

00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:54.231
on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:58.542
This now allowed me to read back what I'd written

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:00.220
and to enter the computer world,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.620
even with its 84k of memory.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.008
In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,

00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:11.758
worked on building a machine that would scan books

00:07:11.758 --> 00:07:14.289
and read them out in synthetic speech.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.836
Optical character recognition units then

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.576
only operated usually on one font,

00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:23.920
but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.426
and speech synthesizers,

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:29.832
he developed a machine that could read any font.

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:32.963
And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,

00:07:32.963 --> 00:07:36.937
was launched on the 13th of January, 1976.

00:07:36.937 --> 00:07:40.020
I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.327
in March 1989, and it blew me away,

00:07:43.327 --> 00:07:46.117
and in September 1989,

00:07:46.117 --> 00:07:49.310
the month that my associate professorship

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.282
at Monash University was announced,

00:07:51.282 --> 00:07:55.140
the law school got one, and I could use it.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.173
For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:00.581
by putting a book on the scanner.

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.297
I didn't have to be nice to people!

00:08:03.297 --> 00:08:05.940
(Laughter)

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.089
I no longer would be censored.

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:11.130
For example, I was too shy then,

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.602
and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody

00:08:13.602 --> 00:08:16.415
to read me out loud sexually explicit material.

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:20.387
(Laughter)

00:08:20.387 --> 00:08:23.875
But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:29.598
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:36.712
Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply

00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:38.996
a program on my laptop.

00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.340
That's what it's shrunk to.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.430
And now I can scan the latest novel

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.635
and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.

00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:47.896
I can keep up with my friends.

00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:51.136
There are many people who have helped me in my life,

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:53.767
and many that I haven't met.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.416
One is another American inventor Ted Henter.

00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:59.788
Ted was a motorcycle racer,

00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:04.020
but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.579
which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:10.375
He then turned to being a waterskier

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:13.887
and was a champion disabled waterskier.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.134
But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce

00:09:17.134 --> 00:09:21.269
to develop a program that would read out

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.020
what was on the computer screen

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.024
from the Net or from what was on the computer.

00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:28.531
It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,

00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:30.535
and it sounds like this.

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:34.420
(JAWS speaking)

00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:43.748
Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow?

00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:44.718
(Laughter)

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:46.986
You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.195
I slowed it down for you.

00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:51.467
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:53.982
Can we play that one?

00:09:53.982 --> 00:09:58.737
(JAWS speaking)

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:09.832
(Laughter)

00:10:09.832 --> 00:10:11.653
RM: You know, when you're marking student essays,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.570
you want to get through them fairly quickly.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:20.648
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.722
This technology that fascinated me in 1987

00:10:26.722 --> 00:10:30.443
is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.

00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:33.977
But, you know, I find reading with machines

00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:36.390
a very lonely process.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.329
I grew up with family, friends, reading to me,

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:44.248
and I loved the warmth and the breath

00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:46.602
and the closeness of people reading.

00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:48.875
Do you love being read to?

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:51.675
And one of my most enduring memories

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:57.124
is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children

00:10:57.124 --> 00:10:59.520
down near Manly Beach

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.925
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:05.228
Isn't that a great book?

00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:08.060
I still love being close to someone reading to me.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.821
But I wouldn't give up the technology,

00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:15.111
because it's allowed me to lead a great life.

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:17.798
Of course, talking books for the blind

00:11:17.798 --> 00:11:19.410
predated all this technology.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.889
After all, the long-playing record was developed

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:24.278
in the early 1930s,

00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:26.967
and now we put talking books on CDs

00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:32.530
using the digital access system known as DAISY.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.712
But when I'm reading with synthetic voices,

00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:38.662
I love to come home and read a racy novel

00:11:38.662 --> 00:11:42.612
with a real voice.

00:11:42.612 --> 00:11:44.684
Now there are still barriers

00:11:44.684 --> 00:11:46.677
in front of we people with disabilities.

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:49.595
Many websites we can't read using JAWS

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:50.882
and the other technologies.

00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:53.086
Websites are often very visual,

00:11:53.086 --> 00:11:54.533
and there are all these sorts of graphs

00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:57.484
that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:01.281
and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,

00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:06.844
known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards

00:12:06.844 --> 00:12:08.258
for the Internet.

00:12:08.258 --> 00:12:13.688
And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners

00:12:13.688 --> 00:12:15.910
to make their sites compatible so that

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.586
we persons without vision can have a level playing field.

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:24.641
There are other barriers brought about by our laws.

00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:27.190
For example, Australia,

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.682
like about one third of the world's countries,

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:34.226
has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:36.398
or read for we blind persons.

00:12:36.398 --> 00:12:39.618
But those books can't travel across borders.

00:12:39.618 --> 00:12:42.400
For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.426
accessible books in Spanish.

00:12:44.426 --> 00:12:46.804
In Argentina, there are 50,000.

00:12:46.804 --> 00:12:48.583
In no other Latin American country

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:50.660
are there more than a couple of thousand.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.765
But it's not legal to transport the books

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:55.590
from Spain to Latin America.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.347
There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books

00:12:58.347 --> 00:13:01.223
in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:03.912
but they can't be transported to the 60 countries

00:13:03.912 --> 00:13:06.886
in our world where English is the first and the second language.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:10.297
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.

00:13:10.297 --> 00:13:13.411
Well, because we can't transport books across borders,

00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:15.335
there had to be separate versions read

00:13:15.335 --> 00:13:18.264
in all the different English-speaking countries:

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:21.315
Britain, United States, Canada, Australia,

00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.396
and New Zealand all had to have

00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:26.139
separate readings of Harry Potter.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.253
And that's why, next month in Morocco,

00:13:29.253 --> 00:13:31.752
a meeting is taking place between all the countries.

00:13:31.752 --> 00:13:33.155
It's something that a group of countries

00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:35.283
and the World Blind Union are advocating,

00:13:35.283 --> 00:13:37.601
a cross-border treaty

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.739
so that if books are available under a copyright exception

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.708
and the other country has a copyright exception,

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.106
we can transport those books across borders

00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:48.322
and give life to people, particularly in developing countries,

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:52.247
blind people who don't have the books to read.

00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:54.359
I want that to happen.

00:13:54.359 --> 00:14:02.598
(Applause)

00:14:02.598 --> 00:14:05.863
My life has been extraordinarily blessed

00:14:05.863 --> 00:14:08.497
with marriage and children

00:14:08.497 --> 00:14:11.576
and certainly interesting work to do,

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:14.230
whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.502
where I served a term as dean,

00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:19.023
or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee

00:14:19.023 --> 00:14:22.163
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.

00:14:22.163 --> 00:14:27.158
I've indeed been a very fortunate human being.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:30.166
I wonder what the future will hold.

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:33.857
The technology will advance even further,

00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:37.525
but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,

00:14:37.525 --> 00:14:39.459
"Remember, darling,

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:43.604
you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."

00:14:43.604 --> 00:14:48.781
I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,

00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:51.678
volunteer readers and passionate inventors,

00:14:51.678 --> 00:14:54.868
has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me

00:14:54.868 --> 00:14:57.872
and for blind people throughout the world.

00:14:57.872 --> 00:15:01.518
I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,

00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:04.488
who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,

00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:08.879
and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,

00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:10.237
is coming on to collect me.

00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:11.432
I want to thank her too.

00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:13.432
I think I have to say goodbye now.

00:15:13.432 --> 00:15:15.003
Bless you. Thank you very much.

00:15:15.003 --> 00:15:16.727
(Applause)

00:15:16.727 --> 00:15:25.965
Yay! (Applause)

00:15:32.602 --> 00:15:38.571
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause)
