00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Delighted to be here

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
which is beauty.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
actually, for a living.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I try to figure out intellectually,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
philosophically, psychologically,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
what the experience of beauty is,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
what sensibly can be said about it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Now this is an extremely complicated subject,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
in part because the things that we call beautiful

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
are so different.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I mean just think of the sheer variety --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
a baby's face,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
or the plays of Chekhov,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
a central California landscape,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
"Der Rosenkavalier,"

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
a stunning match-winning goal

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
in a World Cup soccer match,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
a Jane Austen novel,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
This brief list includes human beings,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
natural landforms,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
works of art and skilled human actions.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
An account that explains the presence of beauty

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
in everything on this list

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
is not going to be easy.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
I can, however, give you at least a taste

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of what I regard

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
as the most powerful theory of beauty

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
we yet have.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
not from a postmodern art theorist

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
or a bigwig art critic.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
No, this theory

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
comes from an expert

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and you know who I mean:

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Charles Darwin.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Of course, a lot of people think they already know

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
the proper answer to the question,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
"What is beauty?"

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
It's in the eye of the beholder.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
It's whatever moves you personally.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Or, as some people,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
especially academics prefer,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
beauty is in the culturally conditioned

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
eye of the beholder.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
People agree that paintings or movies or music

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
are beautiful

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.260
because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
travel across cultures

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
with great ease.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Beethoven is adored in Japan.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in British museums,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
while Shakespeare is translated

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
into every major language of the Earth.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Or just think about American jazz

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
or American movies --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
they go everywhere.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
There are many differences among the arts,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
but there are also universal,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and values.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
How can we explain

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
this universality?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
a Darwinian evolutionary history

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We need to reverse-engineer

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
our present artistic tastes and preferences

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and explain how they came

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
to be engraved in our minds

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
by the actions of both our prehistoric,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
largely pleistocene environments,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
where we became fully human,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
but also by the social situations

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
in which we evolved.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
This reverse engineering

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
can also enlist help

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
from the human record

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
preserved in prehistory.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And it should take into account

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
what we know of the aesthetic interests

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
of isolated hunter-gatherer bands

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Now, I personally

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
have no doubt whatsoever

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that the experience of beauty,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
with its emotional intensity and pleasure,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
belongs to our evolved human psychology.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
The experience of beauty is one component

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Beauty is an adaptive effect,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
which we extend

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and intensify

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
in the creation and enjoyment

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
of works of art and entertainment.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
As many of you will know,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
The first of these is natural selection --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that's random mutation and selective retention --

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Natural selection also explains

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
many basic revulsions,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
or fears, such as the fear of snakes

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Natural selection also explains pleasures --

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
sexual pleasure,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
from ripe fruits through chocolate malts

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and barbecued ribs.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
The other great principle of evolution

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
is sexual selection,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and it operates very differently.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
The peacock's magnificent tail

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
is the most famous example of this.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
It did not evolve for natural survival.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
In fact, it goes against natural survival.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
No, the peacock's tail

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
results from the mating choices

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
made by peahens.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
It's quite a familiar story.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
It's women who actually push history forward.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
Darwin himself, by the way,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
had no doubts that the peacock's tail

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
He actually used that word.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
we can say that the experience of beauty

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
is one of the ways that evolution has

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
of arousing and sustaining

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
interest or fascination,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
even obsession,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
in order to encourage us

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
toward making the most adaptive decisions

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
for survival and reproduction.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Beauty is nature's way

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
of acting at a distance,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
so to speak.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
I mean, you can't expect to eat

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
an adaptively beneficial landscape.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It would hardly do to eat your baby

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
or your lover.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So evolution's trick

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
is to make them beautiful,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to have them exert a kind of magnetism

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
the magnetic pull

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
of beautiful landscapes.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
People in very different cultures

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
all over the world

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
tend to like a particular kind of landscape,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
a landscape that just happens to be similar

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
This landscape shows up today

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
on calendars, on postcards,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
in the design of golf courses and public parks

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
and in gold-framed pictures

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
that hang in living rooms

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
from New York to New Zealand.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
featuring open spaces

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
of low grasses

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
interspersed with copses of trees.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
The trees, by the way, are often preferred

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
if they fork near the ground,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
if you were in a tight fix.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
The landscape shows the presence

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
of water directly in view,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
or evidence of water in a bluish distance,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
indications of animal or bird life

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
as well as diverse greenery

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and finally -- get this --

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
a path

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
or a road,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that extends into the distance,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
almost inviting you to follow it.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
even by people in countries

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that don't have it.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
The ideal savanna landscape

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
is one of the clearest examples

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
where human beings everywhere

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
find beauty

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
in similar visual experience.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
But, someone might argue,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that's natural beauty.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
How about artistic beauty?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
No, I don't think it is.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to say something about it.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
It is widely assumed

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that the earliest human artworks

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that we all know from Lascaux

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and Chauvet.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
Chauvet caves

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
are about 32,000 years old,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
along with a few small, realistic sculptures

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
of women and animals from the same period.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
But artistic and decorative skills

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
are actually much older than that.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Beautiful shell necklaces

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
as well as ochre body paint,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
have been found

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
from around 100,000 years ago.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
are older even than this.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
I have in mind

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
The oldest stone tools are choppers

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
These crude tools

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
were around for thousands of centuries,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
until around 1.4 million years ago

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
when Homo erectus

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
started shaping

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
single, thin stone blades,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
sometimes rounded ovals,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
but often in what are to our eyes

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
or teardrop form.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
These Acheulian hand axes --

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
they're named after St. Acheul in France,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
where finds were made in 19th century --

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
have been unearthed in their thousands,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
almost everywhere Homo erectus

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and Homo ergaster roamed.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
shows that they can't have been made

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
for butchering animals.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
And the plot really thickens when you realize

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that, unlike other pleistocene tools,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
the hand axes often exhibit

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
no evidence of wear

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
on their delicate blade edges.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And some, in any event, are too big

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
to use for butchery.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Their symmetry, their attractive materials

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and, above all,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
their meticulous workmanship

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
are simply quite beautiful

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
to our eyes, even today.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
So what were these ancient --

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
but they're at the same time

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
somehow familiar.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
What were these artifacts for?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
The best available answer

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
is that they were literally

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
the earliest known works of art,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
practical tools transformed

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
into captivating aesthetic objects,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
contemplated both for their elegant shape

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Hand axes mark

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
an evolutionary advance in human history --

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
tools fashioned to function

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
that is to say, displays

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that are performances

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
like the peacock's tail,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
except that, unlike hair and feathers,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
the hand axes are consciously

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
cleverly crafted.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Competently made hand axes

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
indicated desirable personal qualities --

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
intelligence, fine motor control,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
planning ability,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
conscientiousness

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
and sometimes access to rare materials.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Over tens of thousands of generations,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
such skills increased the status

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
of those who displayed them

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and gained a reproductive advantage

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
over the less capable.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
You know, it's an old line,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
but it has been shown to work --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
(Laughter)

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Except, of course, what's interesting about this

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
because the Homo erectus

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
that made these objects

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
did not have language.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
It's hard to grasp,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
but it's an incredible fact.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
This object was made

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
by a hominid ancestor,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
between 50,000 and 100,000 years

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
before language.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Stretching over a million years,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
the hand axe tradition

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
is the longest artistic tradition

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
in human and proto-human history.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
as they were then called, finally --

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
were doubtless finding new ways

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
to amuse and amaze each other

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
by, who knows, telling jokes,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
For us moderns,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
virtuoso technique

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
is used to create imaginary worlds

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
in fiction and in movies,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
to express intense emotions

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
with music, painting and dance.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
But still,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
one fundamental trait

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
of the ancestral personality persists

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
in our aesthetic cravings:

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
the beauty we find

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
in skilled performances.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
From Lascaux to the Louvre

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
to Carnegie Hall,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
human beings

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
have a permanent innate taste

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
for virtuoso displays in the arts.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
We find beauty

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
in something done well.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
displaying a beautifully cut

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
teardrop-shaped stone,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
don't be so sure

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
it's just your culture telling you

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
Your distant ancestors loved that shape

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
even before

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
they could put their love into words.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
No, it's deep in our minds.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
and rich emotional lives

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
of our most ancient ancestors.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Our powerful reaction to images,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
to the expression of emotion in art,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
will be with us and our descendants

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
for as long as the human race exists.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Thank you.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:27.260
(Applause)
