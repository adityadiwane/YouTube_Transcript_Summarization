00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:17.063
So, my journey began
in the Bronx, New York,

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:19.866
in a one-bedroom apartment,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.561
with my two sisters and immigrant mother.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:26.519
I loved our neighborhood.

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:28.890
It was lively.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:31.359
There was all this merengue blasting,

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:33.772
neighbors socializing on building stoops

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:37.219
and animated conversations
over domino playing.

00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:39.789
It was home,

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:42.344
and it was sweet.

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:44.964
But it wasn't simple.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.259
In fact, everyone at school
knew the block where we lived,

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:53.398
because it was where people came
to buy weed and other drugs.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.520
And with drug-dealing comes conflict,

00:00:56.544 --> 00:01:00.413
so we often went to sleep
to the sound of gunshots.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.692
I spent much of my childhood worried,

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:07.549
worried about our safety.

00:01:08.803 --> 00:01:10.201
And so did our mother.

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:15.871
She worried that the violence we witnessed
would overtake our lives;

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:18.063
that our poverty meant

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:20.762
that the neighbors with whom
we lived and shared space

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.071
would harm us.

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:25.881
Our entire life was in the Bronx,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.562
but my mother's anxiety
spurred her into action,

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:34.356
and soon we were driving
so fast to Connecticut --

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.452
(Laughter)

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:39.833
to boarding school campuses,
with full scholarships in tow.

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:45.591
Man, don't underestimate
the power of a mother

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:48.167
determined to keep her children safe.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.292
(Cheers)

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:52.735
(Applause)

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:57.004
At boarding school,

00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:00.795
for the first time,

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.184
I was able to sleep without worry.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.396
I could leave my dorm room unlocked,

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:09.803
walk barefoot in the grass,

00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.410
and look up to see
a night sky full of stars.

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:17.992
Happy novelties.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.512
But there were other novelties as well.

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:25.825
Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.358
I learned that I didn't speak
the right way,

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.682
and to demonstrate
the proper ways of speaking,

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:37.287
my teachers gave me
frequent lessons, in public,

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.291
on the appropriate way
to enunciate certain words.

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:45.889
A teacher once instructed me
in the hallway:

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.701
"Aaaaaas-king."

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.135
She said this loudly.

00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:58.946
"Dena, it's not 'axing,'
like you're running around with an axe.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.217
That's silly."

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:07.016
Now at this point, you can imagine
the snickers of my classmates,

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:09.779
but she continued:

00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:16.174
"Think about breaking the word
into 'ass' and 'king,'

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:19.725
and then put the two together
to say it correctly --

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.006
'Asking.'"

00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:27.321
There were some other moments
that reminded me that I didn't belong.

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:31.291
Once, I walked into
a classmate's dorm room,

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:35.138
and I watched her watch
her valuables around me.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.242
Like, why would she do that?
I thought to myself.

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.824
And then there was the time

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:46.287
when another classmate
walked into my dorm room,

00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:50.341
and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying
hair grease to my scalp.

00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:58.007
There is emotional damage done
when young people can't be themselves,

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:03.238
when they are forced to edit who they are
in order to be acceptable.

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:06.637
It's a kind of violence.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.985
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential
success story.

00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:17.199
I attended boarding school
and college in New England,

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.303
studied abroad in Chile

00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:22.442
and returned to the Bronx
to be a middle school teacher.

00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:25.424
I received a Truman Scholarship,

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:28.666
a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.220
And I could list more.

00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:31.759
(Laughter)

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:33.312
But I won't.

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:34.734
(Laughter)

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.041
I earned my doctorate
at Columbia University.

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:40.883
(Cheers)

00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:42.713
(Applause)

00:04:42.737 --> 00:04:45.079
And then I landed a job at Yale.

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:46.869
(Applause)

00:04:47.363 --> 00:04:51.645
I am proud of everything
that I've been able to accomplish

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:53.948
on my journey thus far.

00:04:56.884 --> 00:04:59.847
I have eternal imposter syndrome.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.059
Either I've been invited
because I'm a token,

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.290
which really isn't about me,

00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:09.404
but rather, about a box
someone needed to check off.

00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:12.983
Or, I am exceptional,

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:17.995
which means I've had to leave
the people I love behind.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:25.573
It's the price that I and so many others
pay for learning while black.

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.761
(Applause)

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.470
I police myself all the time.

00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:41.491
Are my pants too tight?

00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.372
Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:49.171
Should I speak up for myself,

00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:53.893
or will the power of my words
be reduced to: "She's angry"?

00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:58.724
Why did I have to leave the Bronx

00:05:58.748 --> 00:06:01.607
to gain access to a better education?

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:07.894
And why, in the process
of getting that better education,

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:13.798
did I have to endure the trauma
of erasing what made me, me --

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.952
a black girl from the Bronx,
raised by an Antiguan mother?

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.534
So when I think about our current
education reform initiatives,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.203
I can't help asking:

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.881
What are our students of color
learning about themselves?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.117
Three -- three decades of research reveal

00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:42.407
that students of color
are suspended and expelled

00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.546
at a rate three times greater
than white students,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.349
and are punished in harsher ways
for the same infractions.

00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:56.635
They also learn this through the absence
of their lives and narratives

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:57.858
in the curricula.

00:06:59.432 --> 00:07:04.317
The Cooperative Children's Book Center
did a review of nearly 4,000 books

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:08.927
and found that only three percent
were about African-Americans.

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:12.049
And they further learn this

00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:14.899
through the lack of teachers
that look like them.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.989
An analysis of data

00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:22.727
from the National Center
for Education Statistics

00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:27.907
found that 45 percent of our nation's
pre-K to high school students

00:07:27.931 --> 00:07:29.558
were people of color,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.724
while only 17 percent of our teachers are.

00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.718
Our youth of color pay a profound price

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.860
when their schooling
sends them the message

00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:44.013
that they must be controlled,

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.863
that they must leave
their identities at home

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:48.980
in order to be successful.

00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:54.314
Every child deserves an education

00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:57.859
that guarantees the safety to learn

00:07:57.883 --> 00:08:02.230
in the comfort of one's own skin.

00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.442
(Applause)

00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:16.794
It is possible to create emotionally
and physically safe classrooms

00:08:16.818 --> 00:08:19.544
where students also thrive academically.

00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.901
I know, because I did it in my classroom

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:26.051
when I returned to teach in the Bronx.

00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.310
So what did that look like?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.074
I centered my instruction

00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:37.249
on the lives, histories
and identities of my students.

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:41.613
And I did all of this
because I wanted my students to know

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:45.324
that everyone around them
was supporting them

00:08:45.348 --> 00:08:47.255
to be their best self.

00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:54.297
So while I could not control
the instability of their homes,

00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.972
the uncertainty of their next meal,

00:08:57.472 --> 00:08:59.922
or the loud neighbors
that kept them from sleep,

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.007
I provided them with a loving classroom

00:09:04.031 --> 00:09:06.748
that made them feel proud of who they are,

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.118
that made them know that they mattered.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.823
You know,

00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:20.073
every time I hear
or say the word "asking,"

00:09:22.977 --> 00:09:24.431
I am in high school again.

00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:30.549
I am thinking about "ass" and "king"

00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:36.182
and putting the two together
so that I speak in a way

00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:39.742
where someone in power
will want to listen.

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.788
There is a better way,

00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:47.979
one that doesn't force kids of color
into a double bind;

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:51.161
a way for them to preserve their ties

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:53.931
to their families, homes and communities;

00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:59.641
a way that teaches them
to trust their instincts

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:06.110
and to have faith
in their own creative genius.

00:10:07.144 --> 00:10:08.327
Thank you.

00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:16.370
(Applause)
