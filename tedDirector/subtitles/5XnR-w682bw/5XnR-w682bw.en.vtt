Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
starts with a conversation.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
And I would like to share with you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
with too much time on my hands.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
that I built in my bedroom,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
much to the dismay of my mother.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
YB: To the dismay of my mother,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
(Laughter)

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
FN: And I brought this all together,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
also the U.S. and Japan.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
We had a lot that got us excited.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
So we decided to do a special project together.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
To combine engineering and design and ...

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
YB: And we made a baby.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.330
(Laughter)

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
FN: Can you bring out our baby?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
(Applause)

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
This baby is fully electric.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
It goes 150 miles an hour.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.330
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330
It's got an amazing user experience.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.330
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
And we've only got three minutes,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
but we could talk about it for hours.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
YB: Thank you.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
(Applause)
