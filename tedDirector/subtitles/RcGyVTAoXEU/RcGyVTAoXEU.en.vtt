00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.511
I have a confession to make.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:22.443
But first, I want you to make
a little confession to me.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.533
In the past year,
I want you to just raise your hand

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:29.947
if you've experienced
relatively little stress.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:30.998
Anyone?

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.879
How about a moderate amount of stress?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.417
Who has experienced a lot of stress?

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.825
Yeah. Me too.

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:42.973
But that is not my confession.

00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:44.758
My confession is this:

00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:46.779
I am a health psychologist,

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:50.646
and my mission is to help people
be happier and healthier.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.902
But I fear that something
I've been teaching

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:59.230
for the last 10 years
is doing more harm than good,

00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:01.084
and it has to do with stress.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.829
For years I've been telling people,
stress makes you sick.

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:07.724
It increases the risk of everything
from the common cold

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:09.520
to cardiovascular disease.

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:13.666
Basically, I've turned stress
into the enemy.

00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.071
But I have changed my mind about stress,

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:20.264
and today, I want to change yours.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.366
Let me start with the study
that made me rethink

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.377
my whole approach to stress.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.639
This study tracked 30,000 adults
in the United States for eight years,

00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:33.166
and they started by asking people,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.382
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:38.628
They also asked,

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:42.984
"Do you believe that stress
is harmful for your health?"

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.986
And then they used public death records
to find out who died.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.191
(Laughter)

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.013
Okay.

00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.187
Some bad news first.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.612
People who experienced a lot of stress
in the previous year

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:59.389
had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.

00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:04.371
But that was only true for the people

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:08.032
who also believed that stress
is harmful for your health.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.816
(Laughter)

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.116
People who experienced a lot of stress

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.080
but did not view stress as harmful

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:16.781
were no more likely to die.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:20.348
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:21.672
of anyone in the study,

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:24.153
including people
who had relatively little stress.

00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:27.516
Now the researchers estimated
that over the eight years

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.110
they were tracking deaths,

00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:32.310
182,000 Americans died prematurely,

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:33.772
not from stress,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:36.977
but from the belief
that stress is bad for you.

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.233
(Laughter)

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.299
That is over 20,000 deaths a year.

00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.735
Now, if that estimate is correct,

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.998
that would make
believing stress is bad for you

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:51.093
the 15th largest cause of death
in the United States last year,

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:55.100
killing more people than skin cancer,
HIV/AIDS and homicide.

00:02:57.172 --> 00:02:59.287
(Laughter)

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:02.112
You can see why this study freaked me out.

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:06.185
Here I've been spending
so much energy telling people

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.050
stress is bad for your health.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.762
So this study got me wondering:

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.858
Can changing how you think
about stress make you healthier?

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:16.702
And here the science says yes.

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:18.784
When you change your mind about stress,

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:22.060
you can change
your body's response to stress.

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:24.417
Now to explain how this works,

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.298
I want you all to pretend
that you are participants

00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:29.905
in a study designed to stress you out.

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.589
It's called the social stress test.

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:34.643
You come into the laboratory,

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.638
and you're told you have to give

00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:41.277
a five-minute impromptu speech
on your personal weaknesses

00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:44.934
to a panel of expert evaluators
sitting right in front of you,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.816
and to make sure you feel the pressure,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.787
there are bright lights
and a camera in your face,

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.270
kind of like this.

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:52.452
(Laughter)

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:55.356
And the evaluators have been trained

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.072
to give you discouraging,
non-verbal feedback,

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:00.270
like this.

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:06.335
(Exhales)

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.756
(Laughter)

00:04:09.264 --> 00:04:11.332
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:14.132
time for part two: a math test.

00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:16.233
And unbeknownst to you,

00:04:16.257 --> 00:04:19.816
the experimenter has been trained
to harass you during it.

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:22.635
Now we're going to all do this together.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.029
It's going to be fun.

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:25.427
For me.

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.468
Okay.

00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:27.699
(Laughter)

00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:31.722
I want you all to count backwards from 996

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:33.114
in increments of seven.

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:34.742
You're going to do this out loud,

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:36.750
as fast as you can,

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:38.866
starting with 996.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.928
Go!

00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:41.309
(Audience counting)

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.122
Go faster. Faster please.

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:45.512
You're going too slow.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:46.574
(Audience counting)

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:48.090
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:49.520
That guy made a mistake.

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:51.742
We are going to have to start
all over again.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:52.767
(Laughter)

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.003
You're not very good at this, are you?

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.477
Okay, so you get the idea.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:58.316
If you were actually in this study,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.262
you'd probably be a little stressed out.

00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:01.801
Your heart might be pounding,

00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:05.205
you might be breathing faster,
maybe breaking out into a sweat.

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.801
And normally, we interpret
these physical changes as anxiety

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.690
or signs that we aren't coping
very well with the pressure.

00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:14.991
But what if you viewed them instead

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:17.338
as signs that your body was energized,

00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:20.342
was preparing you to meet this challenge?

00:05:21.064 --> 00:05:23.626
Now that is exactly
what participants were told

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.104
in a study conducted
at Harvard University.

00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:29.393
Before they went
through the social stress test,

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.599
they were taught to rethink
their stress response as helpful.

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.868
That pounding heart
is preparing you for action.

00:05:36.408 --> 00:05:38.737
If you're breathing faster,
it's no problem.

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:40.972
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:44.519
And participants who learned to view
the stress response

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.756
as helpful for their performance,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.263
well, they were less stressed out,
less anxious, more confident,

00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:52.356
but the most fascinating finding to me

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.319
was how their physical
stress response changed.

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.631
Now, in a typical stress response,

00:05:57.655 --> 00:05:59.447
your heart rate goes up,

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:02.851
and your blood vessels
constrict like this.

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:06.926
And this is one of the reasons
that chronic stress

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.785
is sometimes associated
with cardiovascular disease.

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.542
It's not really healthy to be
in this state all the time.

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:14.606
But in the study,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.637
when participants viewed
their stress response as helpful,

00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.629
their blood vessels
stayed relaxed like this.

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:22.953
Their heart was still pounding,

00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:25.704
but this is a much healthier
cardiovascular profile.

00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:28.359
It actually looks a lot like what happens

00:06:28.383 --> 00:06:32.351
in moments of joy and courage.

00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:35.911
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,

00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:39.101
this one biological change

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.405
could be the difference

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.409
between a stress-induced
heart attack at age 50

00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:45.657
and living well into your 90s.

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.417
And this is really what the new
science of stress reveals,

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.443
that how you think about stress matters.

00:06:53.197 --> 00:06:56.086
So my goal as a health
psychologist has changed.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.248
I no longer want
to get rid of your stress.

00:06:58.272 --> 00:07:01.206
I want to make you better at stress.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.403
And we just did a little intervention.

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:05.459
If you raised your hand and said

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:07.528
you'd had a lot of stress
in the last year,

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.371
we could have saved your life,

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.922
because hopefully the next time
your heart is pounding from stress,

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.769
you're going to remember this talk

00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:16.931
and you're going to think to yourself,

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:21.520
this is my body helping me
rise to this challenge.

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.444
And when you view stress in that way,

00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:26.501
your body believes you,

00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:29.008
and your stress response
becomes healthier.

00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:34.356
Now I said I have over a decade
of demonizing stress

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.330
to redeem myself from,

00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:38.940
so we are going to do
one more intervention.

00:07:38.964 --> 00:07:40.068
I want to tell you

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.963
about one of the most under-appreciated
aspects of the stress response,

00:07:43.987 --> 00:07:45.822
and the idea is this:

00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:48.241
Stress makes you social.

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.026
To understand this side of stress,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.893
we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:58.841
and I know oxytocin has already gotten
as much hype as a hormone can get.

00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:02.180
It even has its own cute nickname,
the cuddle hormone,

00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:04.866
because it's released
when you hug someone.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.815
But this is a very small part
of what oxytocin is involved in.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.846
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.420
It fine-tunes
your brain's social instincts.

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:17.951
It primes you to do things

00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:20.891
that strengthen close relationships.

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:26.310
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact
with your friends and family.

00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:27.896
It enhances your empathy.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.604
It even makes you more willing
to help and support

00:08:30.628 --> 00:08:32.312
the people you care about.

00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:37.626
Some people have even suggested
we should snort oxytocin...

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.867
to become more compassionate and caring.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.116
But here's what most people
don't understand about oxytocin.

00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:50.230
It's a stress hormone.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.224
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out

00:08:54.248 --> 00:08:55.772
as part of the stress response.

00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:58.023
It's as much a part
of your stress response

00:08:58.047 --> 00:09:01.374
as the adrenaline that makes
your heart pound.

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:04.945
And when oxytocin is released
in the stress response,

00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:07.575
it is motivating you to seek support.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.359
Your biological stress response

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.902
is nudging you to tell
someone how you feel,

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:15.614
instead of bottling it up.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:19.386
Your stress response wants
to make sure you notice

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.705
when someone else
in your life is struggling

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:23.688
so that you can support each other.

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:25.959
When life is difficult,

00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:30.570
your stress response wants you
to be surrounded

00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:32.113
by people who care about you.

00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:37.313
Okay, so how is knowing this side
of stress going to make you healthier?

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:40.247
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act
on your brain.

00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:42.638
It also acts on your body,

00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:44.837
and one of its main roles in your body

00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:49.522
is to protect your cardiovascular system
from the effects of stress.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.500
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.

00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:55.945
It also helps your blood vessels
stay relaxed during stress.

00:09:55.969 --> 00:09:59.342
But my favorite effect on the body
is actually on the heart.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:03.304
Your heart has receptors for this hormone,

00:10:03.328 --> 00:10:06.782
and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:09.940
and heal from any stress-induced damage.

00:10:10.774 --> 00:10:14.473
This stress hormone
strengthens your heart.

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.833
And the cool thing
is that all of these physical benefits

00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:23.883
of oxytocin are enhanced
by social contact and social support.

00:10:23.907 --> 00:10:26.802
So when you reach out
to others under stress,

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:30.075
either to seek support
or to help someone else,

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:32.083
you release more of this hormone,

00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:34.345
your stress response becomes healthier,

00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:37.020
and you actually recover
faster from stress.

00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:39.777
I find this amazing,

00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:43.705
that your stress response
has a built-in mechanism

00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:46.610
for stress resilience,

00:10:46.634 --> 00:10:49.015
and that mechanism is human connection.

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:54.374
I want to finish by telling you
about one more study.

00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:57.516
And listen up, because this study
could also save a life.

00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:01.906
This study tracked about 1,000 adults
in the United States,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.069
and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,

00:11:06.093 --> 00:11:08.338
and they started the study by asking,

00:11:08.362 --> 00:11:11.565
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:14.280
They also asked,

00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:18.939
"How much time have you spent
helping out friends, neighbors,

00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:20.801
people in your community?"

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:24.884
And then they used public records
for the next five years

00:11:24.908 --> 00:11:26.287
to find out who died.

00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:30.188
Okay, so the bad news first:

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:33.147
For every major stressful life experience,

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.196
like financial difficulties
or family crisis,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.390
that increased the risk
of dying by 30 percent.

00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:44.421
But -- and I hope you
are expecting a "but" by now --

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.852
but that wasn't true for everyone.

00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:50.514
People who spent time caring for others

00:11:50.538 --> 00:11:55.041
showed absolutely no stress-related
increase in dying.

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:56.065
Zero.

00:11:56.738 --> 00:11:58.813
Caring created resilience.

00:12:00.233 --> 00:12:01.692
And so we see once again

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:04.330
that the harmful effects
of stress on your health

00:12:04.354 --> 00:12:05.994
are not inevitable.

00:12:06.578 --> 00:12:09.014
How you think and how you act

00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:12.078
can transform your experience of stress.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:17.912
When you choose to view
your stress response as helpful,

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:21.069
you create the biology of courage.

00:12:22.547 --> 00:12:25.964
And when you choose to connect
with others under stress,

00:12:25.988 --> 00:12:28.106
you can create resilience.

00:12:29.606 --> 00:12:35.136
Now I wouldn't necessarily ask
for more stressful experiences in my life,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.168
but this science has given me
a whole new appreciation for stress.

00:12:41.237 --> 00:12:44.349
Stress gives us access to our hearts.

00:12:45.897 --> 00:12:49.556
The compassionate heart
that finds joy and meaning

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.094
in connecting with others,

00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:54.656
and yes, your pounding physical heart,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.541
working so hard to give you
strength and energy.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:03.264
And when you choose to view
stress in this way,

00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:05.776
you're not just getting better at stress,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.543
you're actually making
a pretty profound statement.

00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:14.636
You're saying that you can trust yourself
to handle life's challenges.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:20.691
And you're remembering
that you don't have to face them alone.

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:22.709
Thank you.

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:24.930
(Applause)

00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:35.062
Chris Anderson: This is kind
of amazing, what you're telling us.

00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:38.993
It seems amazing to me
that a belief about stress

00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:42.958
can make so much difference
to someone's life expectancy.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.702
How would that extend to advice,

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.869
like, if someone is making
a lifestyle choice

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:51.748
between, say, a stressful job
and a non-stressful job,

00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:54.429
does it matter which way they go?

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:56.958
It's equally wise to go
for the stressful job

00:13:56.982 --> 00:13:59.895
so long as you believe
that you can handle it, in some sense?

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:02.179
KM: Yeah, and one thing
we know for certain

00:14:02.203 --> 00:14:04.587
is that chasing meaning
is better for your health

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:06.191
than trying to avoid discomfort.

00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:09.263
And so I would say that's really
the best way to make decisions,

00:14:09.287 --> 00:14:12.010
is go after what it is
that creates meaning in your life

00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:15.091
and then trust yourself to handle
the stress that follows.

00:14:15.758 --> 00:14:18.130
CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.
It's pretty cool.

00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:20.952
(Applause)
