00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:18.846
I have spent the past 38 years
trying to be invisible.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.259
I'm a copy editor.

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.507
I work at The New Yorker,

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:27.705
and copyediting for The New Yorker
is like playing shortstop

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.943
for a Major League Baseball team:

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.380
every little movement
gets picked over by the critics --

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:36.006
God forbid you should commit an error.

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:41.023
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose
what goes into the magazine.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.908
We work at the level of the sentence,

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:45.620
maybe the paragraph,

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.722
the words, the punctuation.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.880
Our business is in the details.

00:00:50.904 --> 00:00:56.038
We put the diaeresis, the double dot,
over the "i" in "naïve."

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.518
We impose house style.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:01.228
Every publication has a house style.

00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:03.775
The New Yorker's
is particularly distinctive.

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:07.283
We sometimes get teased for our style.

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:11.647
Imagine -- we still spell
"teen-ager" with a hyphen,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.947
as if that word had just been coined.

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:18.519
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age"

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:21.135
and that diaeresis over "coöperate,"

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.161
and you know you're reading
The New Yorker.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.348
Copyediting at The New Yorker
is a mechanical process.

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:30.571
There is a related role called
query proofreading,

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:32.451
or page-OK'ing.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.729
Whereas copyediting is mechanical,

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:38.228
query proofreading is interpretive.

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:42.068
We make suggestions to the author
through the editor

00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:44.713
to improve the emphasis of a sentence

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.371
or point out unintentional repetitions

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:51.391
and supply compelling alternatives.

00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:55.480
Our purpose is to make
the author look good.

00:01:55.504 --> 00:01:58.833
Note that we give our proofs
not directly to the author,

00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:00.376
but to the editor.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.517
This often creates
a good cop/bad cop dynamic

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.065
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that
as an umbrella term --

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.096
is invariably the bad cop.

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.445
If we do our job well, we're invisible,

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.541
but as soon as we make a mistake,

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:20.381
we copy editors become glaringly visible.

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:24.957
Here is the most recent mistake
that was laid at my door.

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.455
[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,
the pre-Trump embodiment

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.625
of populist no-nothingism
in the Republican Party,

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.096
endorsed Trump.]

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:39.143
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled
copy editors?" a reader wrote.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.333
"Didn't the writer mean
'know-nothingism'?"

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.066
Ouch.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.762
There's no excuse for this mistake.

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:49.875
But I like it: "no-nothingism."

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.857
It might be American
vernacular for "nihilism."

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.088
(Laughter)

00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:00.136
Here, another reader quotes
a passage from the magazine:

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.197
[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained
her authoritative bearing;

00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:08.199
only her unsteady gait belied her age.]

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.921
He added:

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:13.028
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker
knows the meaning of 'belied,'

00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:16.260
and that it is the opposite
of how it is used in this sentence.

00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:17.958
Come on! Get it together."

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:22.156
Belie: to give a false impression.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.227
It should have been "betrayed."

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:28.301
E.B. White once wrote
of commas in The New Yorker:

00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:33.189
"They fall with the precision
of knives outlining a body."

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.915
(Laughter)

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.745
And it's true -- we get a lot
of complaints about commas.

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:42.120
"Are there really two commas
in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:47.827
There may not be on the sign, but yes,
that is New Yorker style for "Jr."

00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:50.157
One wag wrote:

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:53.623
["Please, could you expel,
or, at least, restrain,

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:56.671
the comma-maniac,
on your editorial staff?"]

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.047
(Laughter)

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.222
Ah, well.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.490
In this case, those commas
are well-placed,

00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:03.385
except that there should not be one

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.411
between "maniac" and "on."

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:06.670
(Laughter)

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:10.442
Also, if we must have commas
around "at least,"

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.506
we might change it up
by using dashes around that phrase:

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.218
"... -- or, at least, restrain --"

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:19.562
Perfect.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.164
(Applause)

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:22.523
Then there's this:

00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:23.985
"Love you, love your magazine,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.206
but can you please stop writing
massive numbers as text?"

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.784
[two and a half million ...]

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:31.967
No.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.029
(Laughter)

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:37.155
One last cri de coeur
from a spelling stickler:

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:42.323
["Those long stringy things
are vocal cords, not chords."]

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:44.496
The outraged reader added,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.353
"I'm sure I'm not the first to write

00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:49.598
regarding this egregious
proofreading error,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.028
but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:53.272
Fie!"

00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.517
(Laughter)

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.426
I used to like getting mail.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:01.818
There is a pact
between writers and editors.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.221
The editor never sells out the writer,

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:07.797
never goes public about bad jokes
that had to be cut

00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:10.271
or stories that went on too long.

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.153
A great editor saves a writer
from her excesses.

00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:17.586
Copy editors, too, have a code;

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.093
we don't advertise our oversights.

00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:23.293
I feel disloyal divulging them here,

00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:26.371
so let's have look at what we do right.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.474
Somehow, I've gotten
a reputation for sternness.

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:35.250
But I work with writers who know
how to have their way with me.

00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:39.889
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy,"
since the early 80s.

00:05:39.913 --> 00:05:41.542
And he's one of my favorites,

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:44.011
even though he sometimes writes a sentence

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:46.131
that gives a copy editor pause.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.380
Here is one from a story
about Staten Island

00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:51.395
after Hurricane Sandy:

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:56.101
[A dock that had been broken
in the middle and lost its other half

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.509
sloped down toward the water,

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:02.213
its support pipes and wires
leaning forward

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:06.048
like when you open a box
of linguine and it slides out.]

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:07.326
(Laughter)

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.480
This would never have got past
the grammarian in the days of yore.

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:13.743
But what could I do?

00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:16.371
Technically, the "like" should be an "as,"

00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:17.839
but it sounds ridiculous,

00:06:17.863 --> 00:06:21.576
as if the author were about to embark
on an extended Homeric simile --

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.371
"as when you open a box of linguine."

00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:26.704
(Laughter)

00:06:26.728 --> 00:06:31.504
I decided that the hurricane
conferred poetic justice on Sandy

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:33.179
and let the sentence stand.

00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:34.290
(Laughter)

00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:36.322
Generally, if I think something is wrong,

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:37.838
I query it three times.

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:41.717
I told Sandy that not long ago
in a moment of indiscretion and he said,

00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:43.252
"Only three?"

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:45.020
So, he has learned to hold out.

00:06:45.044 --> 00:06:47.443
Recently, he wrote a story
for "Talk of the Town,"

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.688
that's the section
at the front of the magazine

00:06:49.712 --> 00:06:52.790
with short pieces on subjects
ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit

00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:54.359
at the Metropolitan Museum

00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:57.554
to the introduction
of doggie bags in France.

00:06:57.578 --> 00:06:59.996
Sandy's story was about
the return to the Bronx

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.687
of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:05.260
There were three things
in it that I had to challenge.

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:06.848
First, a grammar query.

00:07:06.872 --> 00:07:09.467
The justice was wearing black
and Sandy wrote,

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:14.567
[Her face and hands stood out
like in an old, mostly dark painting.]

00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:16.993
Now, unlike with the hurricane,

00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:19.485
with this "like," the author
didn't have the excuse

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:21.316
of describing hurricane damage.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.636
"Like" in this sense is a preposition,
and a preposition takes an object,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.853
which is a noun.

00:07:26.877 --> 00:07:29.409
This "like" had to be an "as."

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:32.591
"As in an old, mostly dark painting."

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:34.265
Second, a spelling issue.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.284
The author was quoting someone
who was assisting the justice:

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.408
["It will be just a minute.

00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:42.073
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:44.584
Mic'ed?

00:07:44.982 --> 00:07:46.979
The music industry spells it "mic"

00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:49.361
because that's how it's spelled
on the equipment.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.812
I'd never seen it used
as a verb with this spelling,

00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:54.366
and I was distraught
to think that "mic'ed"

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.675
would get into the magazine on my watch.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:57.710
(Laughter)

00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.653
New Yorker style for "microphone"
in its abbreviated form is "mike."

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.146
Finally, there was a sticky
grammar and usage issue

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.884
in which the pronoun has to have
the same grammatical number

00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:10.359
as its antecedent.

00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:14.887
[everyone in the vicinity
held their breath]

00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:19.686
"Their" is plural and "everyone,"
its antecedent, is singular.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.648
You would never say,
"Everyone were there."

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:26.513
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.

00:08:26.537 --> 00:08:30.151
But people say things like,
"Everyone held their breath" all the time.

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.394
To give it legitimacy,

00:08:31.418 --> 00:08:34.841
copy editors call it
"the singular 'their,'"

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:37.930
as if calling it singular
makes it no longer plural.

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:39.348
(Laughter)

00:08:39.372 --> 00:08:44.571
It is my job when I see it in print
to do my best to eliminate it.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.848
I couldn't make it,
"Everyone held her breath,"

00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.564
or "Everyone held his breath,"

00:08:49.588 --> 00:08:52.150
or "Everyone held his or her breath."

00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:54.994
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.

00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.374
I asked, through the editor,

00:08:56.398 --> 00:08:58.446
if the author would consider changing it

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.041
to "All in the vicinity
held their breath,"

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:02.907
because "all" is plural.

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:04.088
Nope.

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:07.342
I tried again: "All those present
held their breath?"

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:09.587
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:10.858
But the editor pointed out

00:09:10.882 --> 00:09:13.287
that we could not have "present"
and "presence"

00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:14.754
in the same sentence.

00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:16.687
When the final proof came back,

00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.287
the author had accepted "as" for "like,"

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:21.246
and "miked" for "mic'ed."

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.744
But on "Everyone held their breath,"
he stood his ground.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.886
Two out of three isn't bad.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.253
In the same issue,

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.799
in that piece on doggie bags in France,

00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:35.561
there was the gratuitous use
of the f-word by a Frenchman.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.864
I wonder, when the mail comes in,

00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:41.746
which will have offended the readers more.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.443
(Laughter)

00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:44.618
Thank you.

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.994
(Applause)
