00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.386
Everyone, please think
of your biggest personal goal.

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:23.665
For real -- you can take a second.
You've got to feel this to learn it.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.990
Take a few seconds and think
of your personal biggest goal, okay?

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.108
Imagine deciding right now
that you're going to do it.

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:33.401
Imagine telling someone that you
meet today what you're going to do.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:35.660
Imagine their congratulations,

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:37.236
and their high image of you.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.609
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.099
Don't you feel one step closer already,

00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:44.577
like it's already becoming
part of your identity?

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.597
Well, bad news: you should
have kept your mouth shut,

00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.050
because that good feeling

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:52.145
now will make you less likely to do it.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:55.081
The repeated psychology tests have proven

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.453
that telling someone your goal
makes it less likely to happen.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.671
Any time you have a goal,

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.719
there are some steps that need to be done,

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:05.324
some work that needs to be done
in order to achieve it.

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:08.644
Ideally you would not be satisfied
until you'd actually done the work.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.540
But when you tell someone your goal
and they acknowledge it,

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.467
psychologists have found
that it's called a "social reality."

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.501
The mind is kind of tricked
into feeling that it's already done.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:19.780
And then because you've felt
that satisfaction,

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:22.752
you're less motivated to do
the actual hard work necessary.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.085
(Laughter)

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.141
So this goes against conventional wisdom

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.554
that we should tell our friends
our goals, right?

00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:31.103
So they hold us to it.

00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:33.236
So, let's look at the proof.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.086
1926: Kurt Lewin,
founder of social psychology,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.590
called this "substitution."

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.979
1933: Wera Mahler found
when it was acknowledged by others,

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.718
it felt real in the mind.

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:45.236
1982, Peter Gollwitzer
wrote a whole book about this,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.803
and in 2009,

00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:49.374
he did some new tests that were published.

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:50.866
It goes like this:

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.889
163 people across four separate tests.

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.770
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.

00:01:56.794 --> 00:02:00.681
Then half of them announced
their commitment to this goal to the room,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:01.887
and half didn't.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.791
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:07.110
that would directly lead them
towards their goal,

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:09.578
but they were told
that they could stop at any time.

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:11.485
Now, those who kept their mouths shut

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.236
worked the entire 45 minutes on average,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.797
and when asked afterward,

00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:18.485
said that they felt
that they had a long way to go still

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.662
to achieve their goal.

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:21.236
But those who had announced it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.102
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.856
and when asked afterward,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.591
said that they felt much closer
to achieving their goal.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.272
So if this is true, what can we do?

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.497
Well, you could resist the temptation
to announce your goal.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.544
You can delay the gratification
that the social acknowledgment brings,

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:44.348
and you can understand that your mind
mistakes the talking for the doing.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.308
But if you do need
to talk about something,

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:51.679
you can state it in a way
that gives you no satisfaction,

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:53.822
such as, "I really want
to run this marathon,

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:55.576
so I need to train five times a week

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.303
and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.071
So audience, next time you're
tempted to tell someone your goal,

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:02.245
what will you say?

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.270
(Silence)

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:04.546
Exactly! Well done.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.236
(Laughter)

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
(Applause)
