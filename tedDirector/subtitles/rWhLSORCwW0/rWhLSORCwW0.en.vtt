00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
One of the things that

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
defines a TEDster

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is you've taken your passion,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and you've turned it into stewardship.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
You actually put action to the issues you care about.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
But what you're going to find eventually is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
you may need to actually get elected officials

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
to help you out.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
So, how do you do that?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
One of the things I should probably tell you is,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and that sort of warped my framework.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
So, when you start to think about politicians,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and they have very strange breeding habits,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
What we need to understand is:

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
What drives the political creature?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
One is reputation and influence.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
These are the primary tools by which

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
a politician can do his job.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
The second one -- unlike most animals,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
which is survival of the species --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
this is preservation of self.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Now you may think it's money,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
but that's actually sort of a proxy

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
to what I can do to preserve myself.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
You can send them an email.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Viagra ads coming at me,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
your email is lost.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It doesn't matter, it's spam.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
How about you get on the phone?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
That doesn't move.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Face to face would work,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
but it's hard to set it up.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
and they set a context for having a conversation,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
but it takes some time to build up.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So what actually works?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And the answer is rather strange.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
It's a letter.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
We live in a digital world,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
but we're fairly analog creatures.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Letters actually work.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Even the top dog himself

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
takes time every day to read 10 letters

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that are picked out by staff.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
will tell you about the letters they get

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
and what they mean.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So, how are you going to write your letter?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
but this is actually critical.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And it is critical that

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
you actually handwrite your letter.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It is so novel to see this,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
that somebody actually picked up an analog device

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and has written to me.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
you get into a proactive stance

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Here's my promise to you:

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
If you are consistent and do this,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
within three months the elected official will start calling you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Now, I'm going to give you

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
a four paragraph format to work with.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Now, when you approach these animals,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and you also need to approach them

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So in paragraph number one,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
You appreciate them.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So, here you go. (Laughter)

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Paragraph number two:

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
You may actually have to just get very blunt

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and say what's really on your mind.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
When you do this,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
don't attack people;

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
you attack tactics.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Paragraph number three:

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
When animals are attacked or cornered,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
they will fight to the death,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
so you have to give them an exit.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
"Obviously, you're intelligent.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
If you had the right information,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
you would have done the right thing." (Laughter)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
You're the safe place to come in to.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So, in paragraph number four,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
you're going to tell people,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Animals do displays. They do two things:

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
They warn you or they try to attract you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and say, "We need to mate."

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
you volunteer, you do something else.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Why is is this important?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Because this establishes the two

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
primary criteria for the political creature:

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
that you have influence in a large sphere,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and that my preservation depends on you.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Here is one very quick hack,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
especially for the feds in the audience.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Here's how you mail your letter.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
First of all, you send the original to the district office.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So, you send the copy to the main office.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And you actually get into the folder

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that the elected official actually has to read.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So, what your letter means:

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and political officials are the pinatas.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.260
(Laughter)

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
We are harangued, lectured to,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
sold, marketed,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
but a letter is actually one of the few times

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that we have honest communication.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
I got this letter when I was first elected,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and I still carry it to

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
every council meeting I go to.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and if you have stewardship

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and want to communicate,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that dialogue is incredibly powerful.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Get writing.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
(Applause)
