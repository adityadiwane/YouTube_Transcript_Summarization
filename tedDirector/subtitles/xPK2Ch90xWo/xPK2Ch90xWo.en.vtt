00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:19.497
(Rainforest noises)

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.167
In the summer of 2011,
as a tourist,

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:29.593
I visited the rainforests of Borneo
for the very first time,

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:31.641
and as you might imagine,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:36.911
it was the overwhelming sounds
of the forest that struck me the most.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.721
There's this constant cacophony of noise.

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.136
Some things actually do stick out.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:46.562
For example, this here is a big bird,
a rhinoceros hornbill.

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:50.734
This buzzing is a cicada.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:54.047
This is a family of gibbons.

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:58.161
It's actually singing to each other
over a great distance.

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.334
The place where this was recorded
was in fact a gibbon reserve,

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.371
which is why you can hear so many of them,

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:09.302
but in fact the most important noise that 
was coming out of the forest that time

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.834
was one that I didn't notice,

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.943
and in fact nobody there
had actually noticed it.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.361
So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.170
They spend most of their time
rehabilitating gibbons,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.731
but they also have
to spend a lot of their time

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.423
protecting their area from illegal logging
that takes place on the side.

00:01:25.423 --> 00:01:27.466
And so if we take the sound of the forest

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:31.023
and we actually turn down the gibbons,
the insects, and the rest,

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:34.689
in the background, the entire time,
in recordings you heard,

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.403
was the sound of a chainsaw
at great distance.

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:42.397
They had three full-time guards
who were posted around this sanctuary

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:46.599
whose job was in fact
to guard against illegal logging,

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.058
and one day, we went walking,
again as tourists, out into the forest,

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:52.311
and within five minutes' walk,

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.690
we stumbled upon somebody
who was just sawing a tree down,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.951
five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters
from the ranger station.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.009
They hadn't been able
to hear the chainsaws,

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.826
because as you heard,
the forest is very, very loud.

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:08.745
It struck me as quite unacceptable
that in this modern time,

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:13.217
just a few hundred meters away 
from a ranger station in a sanctuary,

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:17.022
that in fact nobody could hear it when
someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:21.687
It sounds impossible,
but in fact, it was quite true.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.523
So how do we stop illegal logging?

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:26.952
It's really tempting, as an engineer,
always to come up with a high-tech,

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:28.713
super-crazy high-tech solution,

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:30.663
but in fact, you're in the rainforest.

00:02:30.663 --> 00:02:33.040
It has to be simple,
it has to be scalable,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.048
and so what we also noticed
while were there was that

00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:38.374
everything we needed was already there.

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:41.125
We could build a system
that would allow us to stop this

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.407
using what's already there.

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.639
Who was there? What was 
already in the forest?

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.787
Well, we had people.

00:02:46.787 --> 00:02:50.072
We had this group there that was 
dedicated, three full-time guards,

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:51.846
that was dedicated to go and stop it,

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:54.960
but they just needed to know
what was happening out in the forest.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.853
The real surprise, this is the big one,

00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:59.236
was that there was connectivity
out in the forest.

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:02.150
There was cell phone service
way out in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.081
We're talking hundreds of kilometers
from the nearest road,

00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.653
there's certainly no electricity,
but they had very good cell phone service,

00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:11.276
these people in the towns
were on Facebook all the time,

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.226
they're surfing the web on their phones,

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.335
and this sort of got me thinking
that in fact it would be possible

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:18.494
to use the sounds of the forest,

00:03:18.494 --> 00:03:20.886
pick up the sounds 
of chainsaws programmatically,

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.534
because people can't hear them,

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:24.221
and send an alert.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.803
But you have to have a device
to go up in the trees.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:30.454
So if we can use some device
to listen to the sounds of the forest,

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.687
connect to the cell phone
network that's there,

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:34.721
and send an alert to people on the ground,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.271
perhaps we could have a solution
to this issue for them.

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:41.551
But let's take a moment
to talk about saving the rainforest,

00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:45.393
because it's something that we've
definitely all heard about forever.

00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:48.312
People in my generation
have heard about saving the rainforest

00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:50.212
since we were kids,

00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:52.460
and it seems that the message
has never changed:

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.982
We've got to save the rainforest,
it's super urgent,

00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:57.688
this many football fields
have been destroyed yesterday.

00:03:57.688 --> 00:04:00.992
and yet here we are today,
about half of the rainforest remains,

00:04:00.992 --> 00:04:05.319
and we have potentially more urgent 
problems like climate change.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.228
But in fact, this is the little-known fact
that I didn't realize at the time:

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.189
Deforestation accounts 
for more greenhouse gas

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.229
than all of the world's planes,
trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.945
It's the second highest contributor
to climate change.

00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:21.778
Also, according to Interpol,

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:25.307
as much as 90 percent of the logging
that takes place in the rainforest

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:29.088
is illegal logging,
like the illegal logging that we saw.

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:33.132
So if we can help people in the forest
enforce the rules that are there,

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:37.056
then in fact we could eat heavily
into this 17 percent

00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:39.667
and potentially have a major impact
in the short term.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:44.832
It might just be the cheapest,
fastest way to fight climate change.

00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:46.830
And so here's the system that we imagine.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.024
It looks super high tech.

00:04:48.024 --> 00:04:50.657
The moment a sound of a chainsaw
is heard in the forest,

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.829
the device picks up the sound
of the chainsaw,

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:56.436
it sends an alert through the standard
GSM network that's already there

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:58.523
to a ranger in the field

00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:01.340
who can in fact show up in real time
and stop the logging.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.249
It's no more about going out
and finding a tree that's been cut.

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.425
It's not about seeing 
a tree from a satellite

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.061
in an area that's been clear cut,

00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:11.259
it's about real-time intervention.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.390
So I said it was the cheapest
and fastest way to do it,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.315
but in fact, actually, as you saw,
they weren't able to do it,

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.199
so it may not be so cheap and fast.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.635
But if the devices in the trees
were actually cell phones,

00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:24.191
it could be pretty cheap.

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.478
Cell phones are thrown away
by the hundreds of millions every year,

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.599
hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.780
not counting the rest of the world,
which of course we should do,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.311
but in fact, cell phones are great.

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.644
They're full of sensors.

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:39.796
They can listen
to the sounds of the forest.

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:41.178
We do have to protect them.

00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:43.585
We have to put them in this box
that you see here,

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:45.152
and we do have to power them.

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:47.915
Powering them is one of the greater
engineering challenges

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.215
that we had to deal with,

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.967
because powering a cell phone
under a tree canopy,

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:54.219
any sort of solar power
under a tree canopy,

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.029
was an as-yet-unsolved problem,

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.886
and that's this unique
solar panel design that you see here,

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:03.205
which in fact is built also from recycled
byproducts of an industrial process.

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:05.829
These are strips that are cut down.

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.335
So this is me putting it all together

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:11.216
in my parents' garage, actually.

00:06:11.216 --> 00:06:13.793
Thanks very much to them
for allowing me to do that.

00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:18.149
As you can see,
this is a device up in a tree.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:21.734
What you can see from here, perhaps,
is that they are pretty well obscured

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.536
up in the tree canopy at a distance.

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:27.013
That's important, because although
they are able to hear chainsaw noises

00:06:27.013 --> 00:06:28.783
up to a kilometer in the distance,

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:31.303
allowing them to cover
about three square kilometers,

00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:34.481
if someone were to take them,
it would make the area unprotected.

00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:38.034
So does it actually work?

00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:41.006
Well, to test it,
we took it back to Indonesia,

00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:43.119
not the same place, but another place,

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.790
to another gibbon reserve

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.635
that was threatened daily
by illegal logging.

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:52.424
On the very second day, it picked up
illegal chainsaw noises.

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:54.623
We were able to get a real-time alert.

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:55.970
I got an email on my phone.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.686
Actually, we had just climbed the tree.
Everyone had just gotten back down.

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.926
All these guys are smoking cigarettes,

00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:04.783
and then I get an email,
and they all quiet down,

00:07:04.783 --> 00:07:06.887
and in fact you can hear the chainsaw

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.816
really, really faint in the background,

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:11.121
but no one had noticed it 
until that moment.

00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.395
And so then we took off
to actually stop these loggers.

00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:15.904
I was pretty nervous.

00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:20.130
This is the moment where we've actually
arrived close to where the loggers are.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.244
This is the moment where you can see
where I'm actually regretting

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:25.245
perhaps the entire endeavor.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.988
I'm not really sure what's on
the other side of this hill.

00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:29.951
That guy's much braver than I am.

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:34.131
But he went, so I had to go, walking up,

00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.290
and in fact, he made it over the hill,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.527
and interrupted the loggers in the act.

00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.189
For them, it was such a surprise --

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:43.569
they had never, ever
been interrupted before --

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:45.734
that it was such an impressive
event for them,

00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:48.850
that we've heard from our partners
they have not been back since.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.342
They were, in fact, great guys.

00:07:50.342 --> 00:07:52.522
They showed us how
the entire operation works,

00:07:52.522 --> 00:07:55.096
and what they really convinced us
on the spot was that

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:57.341
if you can show up
in real time and stop people,

00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:01.523
it's enough of a deterrent
they won't come back.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:03.085
So --

00:08:03.085 --> 00:08:08.076
Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:13.440
Word of this spread, possibly
because we told a lot of people,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.877
and in fact, then some really
amazing stuff started to happen.

00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:20.546
People from around the world
started to send us emails, phone calls.

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:22.635
What we saw was that people
throughout Asia,

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:25.377
people throughout Africa,
people throughout South America,

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:27.288
they told us that they could use it too,

00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:28.568
and what's most important,

00:08:28.568 --> 00:08:31.066
what we'd found that
we thought might be exceptional,

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:33.648
in the forest there was
pretty good cell phone service.

00:08:33.648 --> 00:08:35.525
That was not exceptional, we were told,

00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:39.468
and that particularly is on the periphery
of the forests that are most under threat.

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:41.768
And then something 
really amazing happened,

00:08:41.768 --> 00:08:45.251
which was that people started sending us
their own old cell phones.

00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:47.201
So in fact what we have now is a system

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:50.544
where we can use people on the ground,
people who are already there,

00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:53.609
who can both improve
and use the existing connectivity,

00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:56.286
and we're using old cell phones
that are being sent to us

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.779
by people from around the world

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:01.072
that want their phones to be doing 
something else in their afterlife,

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:01.826
so to speak.

00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:04.755
And if the rest of the device
can be completely recycled,

00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:07.471
then we believe it's
an entirely upcycled device.

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.125
So again, this didn't come
because of any sort of high-tech solution.

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:13.438
It just came from using
what's already there,

00:09:13.438 --> 00:09:16.294
and I'm thoroughly convinced
that if it's not phones,

00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:18.663
that there's always
going to be enough there

00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:20.474
that you can build similar solutions

00:09:20.474 --> 00:09:22.540
that can be very effective
in new contexts.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.676
Thank you very much.

00:09:24.676 --> 00:09:29.204
(Applause)
