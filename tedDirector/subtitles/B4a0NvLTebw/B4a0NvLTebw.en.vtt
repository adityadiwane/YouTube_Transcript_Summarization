00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:14.905
I used to have this recurring dream

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.341
where I'd walk into a roomful of people,

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:20.960
and I'd try not to make
eye contact with anyone.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.935
Until someone notices me,

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.402
and I just panic.

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.017
And the person walks up to me,

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.550
and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:31.933
And what is your name?"

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:35.498
And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.639
After some awkward silence, he goes,

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:41.244
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.300
And I'm still quiet.

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:48.939
And then, slowly, all the other people
in the room begin to turn toward me

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:51.218
and ask, almost in unison,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.592
(Voice-over, several voices)
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.706
As the chant gets louder,
I want to respond, but I don't.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.849
I'm a visual artist.

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:07.335
Some of my work is humorous,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.960
and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.867
And one thing that I really enjoy doing

00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.157
is making these little animations

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.955
where I get to do the voice-over
for all kinds of characters.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.237
I've been a bear.

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.330
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:28.105
(Laughter)

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.789
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:31.502
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:32.789
(Laughter)

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:34.277
SS: I've been a greeting card.

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.354
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:37.457
(Laughter)

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.488
SS: And my personal favorite
is Frankenstein's monster.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:43.209
(Video) Frankenstein's monster
(SS's voice): (Grunts)

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.273
(Laughter)

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:46.397
SS: I just had to grunt
a lot for that one.

00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.104
A few years ago,
I made this educational video

00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:52.024
about the history of video games.

00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:55.790
And for that one, I got to do
the voice of Space Invader.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.870
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:57.894 --> 00:01:59.341
SS: A dream come true, really,

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:00.367
(Laughter)

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.470
And when that video was posted online,

00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:05.184
I just sat there on the computer,
hitting "refresh,"

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.684
excited to see the response.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:08.622
The first comment comes in.

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:09.940
(Video) Comment: Great job.

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.114
SS: Yes!

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:12.964
I hit "refresh."

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:16.091
(Video) Comment: Excellent video.
I look forward to the next one.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.611
SS: This was just the first
of a two-part video.

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:20.676
I was going to work
on the second one next.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.866
I hit "refresh."

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.726
(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO?
WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.268
(Laughter)

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.235
SS: People other than my mom
were saying nice things about me,

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.425
on the Internet!

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.782
It felt like I had finally arrived.

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:35.108
I hit "refresh."

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:37.831
(Video) Comment: His voice
is annoying. No offense.

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.525
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.113
(Video) Comment: Could you remake this
without peanut butter in your mouth?

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:48.604
SS: OK, at least the feedback
is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:51.174
(Video) Comment: Please don't use
this narrator again

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:52.560
u can barely understand him.

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:53.735
SS: Refresh.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.739
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow
because of the Indian accent.

00:02:56.763 --> 00:02:58.247
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:00.343
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.294
I have a Pakistani accent, OK?

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:05.458
And number two, I clearly
have a Pakistani accent.

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:07.503
(Laughter)

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.258
But comments like that kept coming in,

00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:13.027
so I figured I should just ignore them

00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:15.640
and start working
on the second part of the video.

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:17.634
I recorded my audio,

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:20.657
but every time I sat down to edit,

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.354
I just could not do it.

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:26.676
Every single time, it would take me
back to my childhood,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.521
when I had a much harder time speaking.

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:32.738
I've stuttered for as long
as I can remember.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:35.562
I was the kid in class

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:38.223
who would never raise his hand
when he had a question --

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:39.421
or knew the answer.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:40.760
Every time the phone rang,

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:44.419
I would run to the bathroom
so I would not have to answer it.

00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:48.116
If it was for me, my parents
would say I'm not around.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.070
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:54.192
And I hated introducing myself,

00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:55.825
especially in groups.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.225
I'd always stutter on my name,
and there was usually someone who'd go,

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:00.776
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.377
And then everybody would laugh.

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.006
That joke never got old.

00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:09.310
(Laughter)

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:13.442
I spent my childhood
feeling that if I spoke,

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:18.621
it would become obvious
that there was something wrong with me,

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:20.142
that I was not normal.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.729
So I mostly stayed quiet.

00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:27.905
And so you see, eventually for me to even
be able to use my voice in my work

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:29.502
was a huge step for me.

00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:31.587
Every time I record audio,

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:35.106
I fumble my way through saying
each sentence many, many times,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.764
and then I go back in

00:04:36.788 --> 00:04:40.370
and pick the ones
where I think I suck the least.

00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:46.076
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing
is like Photoshop for your voice.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.911
I can slow it down, speed it up,
make it deeper, add an echo.

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:53.682
And if I stutter along the way,
and if I stutter along the way,

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:55.325
I just go back in and fix it.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.744
It's magic.

00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:59.673
SS: Using my highly edited
voice in my work

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:03.252
was a way for me
to finally sound normal to myself.

00:05:04.302 --> 00:05:06.447
But after the comments on the video,

00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:08.929
it no longer made me feel normal.

00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:12.270
And so I stopped
using my voice in my work.

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:17.750
Since then, I've thought a lot
about what it means to be normal.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.236
And I've come to understand

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.639
that "normal" has a lot to do
with expectations.

00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:26.836
Let me give you an example.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.190
I came across this story

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:30.480
about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.753
Now, Homer mentions
very few colors in his writing.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.255
And even when he does,

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.317
he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:42.228
For example, the sea
is described as wine red,

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:45.799
people's faces are sometimes green
and sheep are purple.

00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:48.213
But it's not just Homer.

00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:50.546
If you look at all
of the ancient literature --

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.770
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian

00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:55.471
and even the original Hebrew Bible --

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:58.071
they all mention very few colors.

00:05:58.745 --> 00:06:02.125
And the most popular theory
for why that might be the case

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:04.553
is that cultures begin
to recognize a color

00:06:04.577 --> 00:06:07.662
only once they have the ability
to make that color.

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.536
So basically, if you can make a color,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.186
only then can you see it.

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:15.386
A color like red, which was fairly easy
for many cultures to make --

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.241
they began to see that color
fairly early on.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:21.008
But a color like blue,
which was much harder to make --

00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:23.785
many cultures didn't begin to learn
how to make that color

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:24.975
until much later.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.515
They didn't begin to see it
until much later as well.

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.189
So until then, even though
a color might be all around them,

00:06:31.213 --> 00:06:33.658
they simply did not have
the ability to see it.

00:06:33.682 --> 00:06:34.840
It was invisIble.

00:06:34.864 --> 00:06:37.244
It was not a part of their normal.

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:41.495
And that story has helped
put my own experience into context.

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.846
So when I first read
the comments on the video,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.765
my initial reaction was to take it
all very personally.

00:06:48.543 --> 00:06:50.441
But the people commenting did not know

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:53.325
how self-conscious I am about my voice.

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:56.905
They were mostly reacting to my accent,

00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:00.446
that it is not normal
for a narrator to have an accent.

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.592
But what is normal, anyway?

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:06.835
We know that reviewers will find
more spelling errors in your writing

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.230
if they think you're black.

00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:13.436
We know that professors are less likely
to help female or minority students.

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.996
And we know that resumes
with white-sounding names

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.913
get more callbacks than resumes
with black-sounding names.

00:07:21.043 --> 00:07:22.241
Why is that?

00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:25.454
Because of our expectations
of what is normal.

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:27.714
We think it is normal

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:29.843
when a black student has spelling errors.

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:31.979
We think it is normal

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:35.195
when a female or minority student
does not succeed.

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:37.601
And we think it is normal

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.711
that a white employee
is a better hire than a black employee.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.993
But studies also show
that discrimination of this kind,

00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:46.062
in most cases, is simply favoritism,

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:49.604
and it results more from wanting
to help people that you can relate to

00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:53.690
than the desire to harm people
that you can't relate to.

00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:58.151
And not relating to people
starts at a very early age.

00:07:58.175 --> 00:07:59.555
Let me give you an example.

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:03.498
One library that keeps track of characters

00:08:03.522 --> 00:08:06.815
in the children's book
collection every year,

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:12.120
found that in 2014,
only about 11 percent of the books

00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:14.344
had a character of color.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:18.045
And just the year before,
that number was about eight percent,

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:21.877
even though half of American children
today come from a minority background.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.051
Half.

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:24.977
So there are two big issues here.

00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.658
Number one, children are told
that they can be anything,

00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:28.833
they can do anything,

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:31.330
and yet, most stories
that children of color consume

00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:33.232
are about people who are not like them.

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:36.015
Number two is that majority groups
don't get to realize

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.072
the great extent to which
they are similar to minorities --

00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:42.143
our everyday experiences, our hopes,

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.039
our dreams, our fears

00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:45.836
and our mutual love for hummus.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.169
It's delicious!

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.900
(Laughter)

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:52.594
Just like the color blue
for Ancient Greeks,

00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:55.939
minorities are not a part
of what we consider normal,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.401
because normal is simply a construction
of what we've been exposed to,

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.214
and how visible it is around us.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.722
And this is where things
get a bit difficult.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:12.994
I can accept the preexisting notion
of normal -- that normal is good,

00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:17.033
and anything outside of that very
narrow definition of normal is bad.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:21.604
Or I can challenge
that preexisting notion of normal

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.635
with my work

00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:25.310
and with my voice

00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:27.761
and with my accent

00:09:28.632 --> 00:09:30.148
and by standing here onstage,

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:33.495
even though I'm scared shitless
and would rather be in the bathroom.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.836
(Laughter)

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.677
(Applause)

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.472
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice):
I'm now slowly starting to use my voice

00:09:48.496 --> 00:09:49.650
in my work again.

00:09:49.674 --> 00:09:50.825
And it feels good.

00:09:50.849 --> 00:09:52.817
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:55.308
the next time a couple dozen
people say that I talk

00:09:55.332 --> 00:09:57.640
(Mumbling) like I have peanut
butter in my mouth.

00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:58.666
(Laughter)

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.370
SS: It just means I now have
a much better understanding

00:10:01.394 --> 00:10:03.138
of what's at stake,

00:10:03.162 --> 00:10:05.662
and how giving up is not an option.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:11.405
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up
one day and realize

00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:12.754
that the sky was blue.

00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:16.635
It took centuries, even, for humans
to realize what we had been ignoring

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:17.828
for so long.

00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:22.714
And so we must continuously challenge
our notion of normal,

00:10:22.738 --> 00:10:27.070
because doing so is going
to allow us as a society

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:29.630
to finally see the sky for what it is.

00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:38.036
(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.651
Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)

00:10:39.675 --> 00:10:40.686
(Laughter)

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.861
SS: Thank you.

00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:45.768
(Applause)
