00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:13.715
I'm going to go off script

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.766
and make Chris quite nervous here

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.114
by making this audience participation.

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.297
All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:23.741
So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:27.797
if you've ever heard a
heterosexual couple having sex.

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:30.348
Could be the neighbors, hotel room,

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.355
your parents. Sorry.

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.107
Okay. Pretty much everybody.

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:35.934
Now raise your hand if the man was making

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.363
more noise than the woman.

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:41.676
I see one guy there.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:43.923
It doesn't count if it was you, sir.

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:44.938
(Laughter)

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:48.448
So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.524
Sitting next to a loud guy.

00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:52.148
Now what does this tell us?

00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:53.994
It tells us that human beings

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:55.362
make noise when they have sex,

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.488
and it's generally the woman who makes more noise.

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.542
This is known as female copulatory vocalization

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:01.965
to the clipboard crowd.

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.596
I wasn't even going to mention this,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.537
but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,

00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:09.141
and she is the world's most famous

00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.090
female copulatory vocalizer.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.490
So I thought, got to talk about that.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.203
We'll get back to that a little bit later.

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:18.168
Let me start by saying human beings

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:20.269
are not descended from apes,

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.501
despite what you may have heard. We are apes.

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.337
We are more closely related
to the chimp and the bonobo

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:28.717
than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.915
as Jared Diamond pointed
out in one of his early books.

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:36.110
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.611
than chimps and bonobos are related

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.273
to any other primate --

00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:41.549
gorillas, orangutans, what have you.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.796
So we're extremely closely related to them,

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:47.222
and as you'll see in terms of our behavior,

00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:49.589
we've got some relationship as well.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.508
So what I'm asking today, the question

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.570
I want to explore with you today is,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.738
what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?

00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:00.956
Now, since Darwin's day there's been

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:02.458
what Cacilda and I have called

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.144
the standard narrative of human sexual evolution,

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:06.698
and you're all familiar with it,

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:09.261
even if you haven't read this stuff.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.329
The idea is that, as part of human nature,

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.318
from the beginning of our species' time,

00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:18.812
men have sort of leased
women's reproductive potential

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:22.207
by providing them with certain goods and services.

00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:25.877
Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:28.508
protection, things like that.

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:30.843
And in exchange, women have offered fidelity,

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:33.221
or at least a promise of fidelity.

00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:37.491
Now this sets men and women up
in an oppositional relationship.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:43.434
The war between the sexes is built right into
our DNA, according to this vision. Right?

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:47.371
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no,

00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:49.812
this economic relationship,

00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:51.637
this oppositional relationship,

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.262
is actually an artifact of agriculture,

00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:57.938
which only arose about 10,000
years ago at the earliest.

00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:00.105
Anatomically modern human beings

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:03.104
have been around for about 200,000 years,

00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:06.726
so we're talking about five percent, at most,

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:10.414
of our time as a modern, distinct species.

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:13.948
So before agriculture,

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:15.953
before the agricultural revolution,

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:18.064
it's important to understand that human beings

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:21.398
lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:24.414
characterized wherever they're found in the world

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:29.005
by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:30.873
They not only share things,

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:33.382
they demand that things be shared:

00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.641
meat, shelter, protection, all these things

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.650
that were supposedly being traded to women

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.480
for their sexual fidelity, it turns out,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.210
are shared widely among these societies.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.398
Now I'm not saying that our ancestors

00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:48.359
were noble savages, and I'm not saying

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.155
modern day hunter-gatherers
are noble savages either.

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:53.166
What I'm saying is that this is simply

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.606
the best way to mitigate risk

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.536
in a foraging context.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.652
And there's really no argument
about this among anthropologists.

00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:05.216
All Cacilda and I have done is extend
this sharing behavior to sexuality.

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.651
So we've argued that human sexuality

00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.135
has essentially evolved, until agriculture,

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:15.281
as a way of establishing and maintaining

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.007
the complex, flexible social systems, networks,

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:21.918
that our ancestors were very good at,

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:26.534
and that's why our species has survived so well.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:28.751
Now, this makes some people uncomfortable,

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.136
and so I always need to take 
a moment in these talks

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.980
to say, listen,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.623
I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,

00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:37.958
but I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers.

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.984
There were no strangers. Right?

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:41.828
In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.

00:04:41.828 --> 00:04:43.817
You've known these people your entire life.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:47.276
So I'm saying, yes, there were
overlapping sexual relationships,

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:51.583
that our ancestors probably had
several different sexual relationships

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.970
going on at any given moment in their adult lives.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.373
But I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers.

00:04:57.373 --> 00:05:00.484
I'm not saying that they didn't love the
people they were having sex with.

00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:03.389
And I'm not saying there was
no pair-bonding going on.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.475
I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:10.159
And those of us who have
chosen to be monogamous --

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.497
my parents, for example, have been married

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:15.005
for 52 years monogamously,

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.367
and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.714
I don't want to hear about itâ€”

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:22.106
I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying

00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:23.662
there's anything wrong with this.

00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:25.821
What I'm saying is that to argue

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:30.495
that our ancestors were sexual omnivores

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.782
is no more a criticism of monogamy

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:36.250
than to argue that our ancestors
were dietary omnivores

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.573
is a criticism of vegetarianism.

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:41.454
You can choose to be a vegetarian,

00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:44.198
but don't think that just because
you've made that decision,

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:46.990
bacon suddenly stops smelling good.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.677
Okay? So this is my point.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:52.028
(Laughter)

00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:55.649
That one took a minute to sink in, huh?

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.979
Now, in addition to being a great genius,

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.044
a wonderful man, a wonderful husband,

00:06:00.044 --> 00:06:01.824
a wonderful father, Charles Darwin

00:06:01.824 --> 00:06:05.936
was also a world-class Victorian prude.

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.876
All right? He was perplexed

00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:10.486
by the sexual swellings of certain primates,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:12.029
including chimps and bonobos,

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.567
because these sexual swellings tend to provoke

00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:17.159
many males to mate with the females.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.330
So he couldn't understand why on Earth would
the female have developed this thing

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.259
if all they were supposed to be doing
is forming their pair bond, right?

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.698
Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:28.646
but chimps and bonobos mate

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:30.300
one to four times per hour

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.716
with up to a dozen males per day

00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:36.332
when they have their sexual swellings.

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.987
Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings

00:06:38.987 --> 00:06:40.789
through 40 percent, roughly,

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.674
of their menstrual cycle,

00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:45.374
bonobos 90 percent,

00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:48.796
and humans are among the
only species on the planet

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:50.898
where the female is available for sex

00:06:50.898 --> 00:06:52.886
throughout the menstrual cycle,

00:06:52.886 --> 00:06:55.630
whether she's menstruating,
whether she's post-menopausal,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.941
whether she's already pregnant.

00:06:56.941 --> 00:07:00.785
This is vanishingly rare among mammals.

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:04.578
So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.

00:07:04.578 --> 00:07:07.253
Now, Darwin ignored the reflections

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:10.821
of the sexual swelling in his own day,

00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.452
as scientists tend to do sometimes.

00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:16.957
So what we're talking about is sperm competition.

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:20.367
Now the average human ejaculate
has about 300 million sperm cells,

00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:22.797
so it's already a competitive environment.

00:07:22.797 --> 00:07:26.010
The question is whether these sperm are 
competing against other men's sperm

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.815
or just their own.

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:29.921
There's a lot to talk about in this chart.

00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:32.096
The one thing I'll call your attention to right away

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:36.138
is the little musical note above the
female chimp and bonobo and human.

00:07:36.138 --> 00:07:39.439
That indicates female copulatory vocalization.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.041
Just look at the numbers.

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:43.237
The average human has sex

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.879
about 1,000 times per birth.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.052
If that number seems high for some of you,

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:52.265
I assure you it seems low for others in the room.

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:55.215
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.

00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:57.517
We don't share it with the other three apes,

00:07:57.517 --> 00:07:59.773
the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,

00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:01.434
who are more typical of mammals,

00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:04.626
having sex only about a dozen times per birth.

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:08.839
Humans and bonobos are the only 
animals that have sex face-to-face

00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:11.253
when both of them are alive.

00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:15.158
(Laughter)

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:19.066
And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.462
all have external testicles, which in our book

00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:25.450
we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.710
just for beer.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.436
If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge

00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:32.778
in the garage, you expect a party to happen

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.567
at any moment, and you need to be ready.

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.722
That's what the external testicles are.

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:39.132
They keep the sperm cells cool

00:08:39.132 --> 00:08:41.350
so you can have frequent ejaculations.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.089
I'm sorry. It's true.

00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:48.178
The human, some of you will be happy to hear,

00:08:48.178 --> 00:08:50.989
has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.499
Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:56.060
It goes into anthropology as well.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.677
Historical records are full of accounts of people

00:08:58.677 --> 00:09:00.486
around the world who have sexual practices

00:09:00.486 --> 00:09:02.116
that should be impossible

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:06.042
given what we have assumed
about human sexual evolution.

00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:08.742
These women are the Mosuo
from southwestern China.

00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:11.309
In their society, everyone, men and women,

00:09:11.309 --> 00:09:13.050
are completely sexually autonomous.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.009
There's no shame associated with sexual behavior.

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:18.255
Women have hundreds of partners.

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:21.437
It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.

00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:23.233
When the woman becomes pregnant,

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:26.091
the child is cared for by her, 
her sisters, and her brothers.

00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:28.930
The biological father is a nonissue.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.336
On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:34.205
we've got many tribes which practice

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:36.937
what anthropologists call partible paternity.

00:09:36.937 --> 00:09:39.534
These people actually believe --

00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:41.249
and they have no contact among them,

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:42.905
no common language or anything,

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:44.642
so it's not an idea that spread,

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:46.779
it's an idea that's arisen around the world --

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:48.936
they believe that a fetus is literally made

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:51.212
of accumulated semen.

00:09:51.212 --> 00:09:53.200
So a woman who wants to have a child

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.032
who's smart and funny and strong

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.163
makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.107
the funny guy and the strong guy,

00:09:59.107 --> 00:10:01.331
to get the essence of each of
these men into the baby,

00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:03.843
and then when the child is born,

00:10:03.843 --> 00:10:05.985
these different men will come forward

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.855
and acknowledge their paternity of the child.

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:11.693
So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor

00:10:11.693 --> 00:10:13.309
in this society.

00:10:13.309 --> 00:10:15.297
So there are all sorts of examples like this

00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:17.747
that we go through in the book.

00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:21.207
Now, why does this matter?

00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:23.767
Edward Wilson says we need to understand

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.813
that human sexuality is first a bonding device

00:10:26.813 --> 00:10:29.648
and only secondarily procreation.

00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:31.832
I think that's true. This matters because

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:34.870
our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.457
with many aspects of the modern world.

00:10:37.457 --> 00:10:39.595
The contradictions between what we're told

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:43.022
we should feel and what we actually do feel

00:10:43.022 --> 00:10:48.159
generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:50.575
My hope is that a more accurate,

00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:52.950
updated understanding of human sexuality

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.970
will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.567
for each other,

00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:01.190
greater respect for unconventional
relationship configurations

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.471
like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,

00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:09.819
and that we'll finally put to rest the idea

00:11:09.819 --> 00:11:12.393
that men have some innate, instinctive right

00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:16.621
to monitor and control women's sexual behavior.

00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.613
(Applause)

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:21.767
Thank you.

00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:24.023
And we'll see that it's not only gay people

00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:25.692
that have to come out of the closet.

00:11:25.692 --> 00:11:29.221
We all have closets we have to come out of. Right?

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.982
And when we do come out of those closets,

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.541
we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,

00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:39.045
our fight is with an outdated, 
Victorian sense of human sexuality

00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:42.600
that conflates desire with property rights,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.365
generates shame and confusion

00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:48.200
in place of understanding and empathy.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.916
It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.646
because the truth is

00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:53.983
that men are from Africa

00:11:53.983 --> 00:11:55.979
and women are from Africa.

00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:57.924
Thank you.

00:11:57.924 --> 00:12:03.383
(Applause)

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.024
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Christopher Ryan: Thank you.

00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:10.766
CA: So a question.

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:14.665
It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments

00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:17.732
about evolutionary history

00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:20.316
to turn that into what we ought to do today.

00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.722
Someone could give a talk and say,

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:25.467
look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:27.194
and muscles and a brain that's really good

00:12:27.194 --> 00:12:28.755
at throwing weapons,

00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:31.819
and if you look at lots of societies around the world,

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.105
you'll see very high rates of violence.

00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:37.274
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,

00:12:37.274 --> 00:12:39.418
but it's not who you are.

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:41.468
How is that different

00:12:41.468 --> 00:12:44.833
from the talk you gave?

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:48.017
CR: Well first of all, the evidence

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.792
for high levels of violence in prehistory

00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:53.398
is very debatable.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.599
But that's just an example.

00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:59.203
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me,

00:12:59.203 --> 00:13:01.743
just because we lived a certain way in the past

00:13:01.743 --> 00:13:04.942
doesn't mean we should live that 
way now, and I agree with that.

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:07.469
Everyone has to respond to the modern world.

00:13:07.469 --> 00:13:11.891
But the body does have its inherent

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.748
evolved trajectories.

00:13:14.748 --> 00:13:18.228
And so you could live on
McDonald's and milkshakes,

00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:21.684
but your body will rebel against 
that. We have appetites.

00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:23.390
I think it was Schopenhauer who said,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.254
a person can do what they want

00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:28.311
but not want what they want.

00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:30.034
And so what I'm arguing against

00:13:30.034 --> 00:13:32.498
is the shame that's associated with desires.

00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:35.857
It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.067
but you still are attracted to other people,

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.566
there's something wrong with you,

00:13:39.566 --> 00:13:41.503
there's something wrong with your marriage,

00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:42.963
something wrong with your partner.

00:13:42.963 --> 00:13:44.986
I think a lot of families are fractured

00:13:44.986 --> 00:13:46.971
by unrealistic expectations

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:50.016
that are based upon this false
vision of human sexuality.

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:51.480
That's what I'm trying to get at.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.979
CA: Thank you. Communicated
powerfully. Thanks a lot.

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:57.970
CR: Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
