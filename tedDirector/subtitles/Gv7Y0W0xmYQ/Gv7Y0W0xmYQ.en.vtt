00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.795
Hi. This is my mobile phone.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:31.238
A mobile phone can change your life,

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:40.070
and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.438
With a mobile phone,

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:47.222
you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:49.174
With a mobile phone,

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.462
you can tweet a message

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:57.305
and start a protest in Egypt.

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.782
And with a mobile phone,

00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:02.703
you can record a song, load it up to

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:05.184
SoundCloud and become famous.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:09.754
All this is possible with your mobile phone.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:11.803
I'm a child of 1984,

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:15.164
and I live in the city of Berlin.

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:20.844
Let's go back to that time, to this city.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:22.083
Here you can see

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.267
how hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.506
stood up and protested for change.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:31.692
This is autumn 1989,

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:36.315
and imagine that all those people standing up

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:39.124
and protesting for change had a

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:42.284
mobile phone in their pocket.

00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:44.011
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:45.146
Hold it up.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.275
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.001
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:57.394
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.

00:01:57.394 --> 00:02:01.946
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.463
and how it changed my life.

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:09.043
And I will talk about this.

00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:14.146
These are 35,830 lines of information.

00:02:14.146 --> 00:02:16.909
Raw data.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.535
And why are these informations there?

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.516
Because in the summer of 2006,

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:28.003
the E.U. Commission tabled a directive.

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:32.668
This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.

00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:37.027
This directive says that each phone company in Europe,

00:02:37.027 --> 00:02:41.524
each Internet service company all over Europe,

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:46.803
has to store a wide range of information about the users.

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:49.964
Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email?

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:52.108
Who sends whom a text message?

00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:56.443
And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:00.895
All this information is stored for at least six months,

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:04.179
up to two years by your phone company

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:10.251
or your Internet service provider.

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:13.911
And all over Europe, people stood up and said,

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:16.418
"We don't want this."

00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:19.816
They said, we don't want this data retention.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:23.353
We want self-determination in the digital age,

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.352
and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:29.801
have to store all this information about us.

00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.484
They were lawyers, journalists, priests,

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:35.640
they all said: "We don't want this."

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.707
And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people

00:03:38.707 --> 00:03:41.363
went out on the streets of Berlin and said,

00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:44.570
"Freedom, not fear."

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.019
And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.056
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany.

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:59.537
And I also ask myself, does it really work?

00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:02.969
Can they really store all this information about us?

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.599
Every time I use my mobile phone?

00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:10.370
So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.135
which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:15.531
and I asked them, please,

00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:19.887
send me all the information you have stored about me.

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:22.061
And I asked them once, and I asked them again,

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.237
and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:28.349
But then I said, I want to have this information,

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.101
because this is my life you are protocoling.

00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.093
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:40.053
because I wanted to have this information.

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.053
But Deutsche Telekom said, no,

00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:44.805
we will not give you this information.

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:49.022
So at the end, I had a settlement with them.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.381
I'll put down the lawsuit

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.589
and they will send me all the information I ask for.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:54.806
Because in the mean time,

00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:57.043
the German Constitutional Court ruled

00:04:57.043 --> 00:05:00.860
that the implementation of this E.U. directive

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.279
into German law was unconstitutional.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.397
So I got this ugly brown envelope

00:05:07.397 --> 00:05:09.965
with a C.D. inside.

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:13.045
And on the C.D., this was on.

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:18.406
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:20.821
At first I saw it, and I said, okay,

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.224
it's a huge file. Okay.

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.741
But then after a while I realized,

00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.029
this is my life.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.813
This is six months of my life,

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:35.111
into this file.

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:39.361
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?

00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:42.540
Because you can see where I am,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.748
where I sleep at night,

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:49.452
what I am doing.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:54.045
But then I said, I want to go out with this information.

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.821
I want to make them public.

00:05:55.821 --> 00:06:00.235
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:05.499
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.627
This is a visualization of six months of my life.

00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:11.515
You can zoom in and zoom out,

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:13.964
you can wind back and fast forward.

00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:17.382
You can see every step I take.

00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:19.707
And you can even see

00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:22.756
how I go from Frankfurt by train

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:26.988
to Cologne, and how often I call in between.

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:31.721
All this is possible with this information.

00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:37.176
That's a little bit scary.

00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:42.676
But it is not only about me.

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:45.076
It's about all of us.

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:49.800
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.471
and we talk to each other a couple of times.

00:06:52.471 --> 00:06:54.933
And then there are some friends calling me,

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:56.861
and they call each other.

00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:58.980
And after a while you are calling you,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.244
and you are calling you, and you have this great

00:07:01.244 --> 00:07:03.668
communication network.

00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:08.149
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.452
what times they call each other, when they go to bed.

00:07:11.452 --> 00:07:13.606
You can see all of this.

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:17.621
You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.

00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:21.101
If you have access to this information,

00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:24.948
you can see what your society is doing.

00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:27.573
If you have access to this information,

00:07:27.573 --> 00:07:31.990
you can control your society.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.966
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:41.134
This is a blueprint how to survey your society,

00:07:41.134 --> 00:07:43.750
because you know who talks to whom,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.631
who sends whom an email, all this is possible

00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:49.329
if you have access to this information.

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:52.366
And this information is stored for at least six months

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:57.353
in Europe, up to two years.

00:07:57.353 --> 00:07:58.968
Like I said at the beginning,

00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:02.401
imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin

00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:04.849
in autumn of 1989

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:07.872
had a mobile phone in their pocket.

00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:11.841
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:13.528
and if the Stasi would have known

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:17.022
who are the leaders behind it,

00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:20.243
this may never have happened.

00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:23.274
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.

00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:26.890
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.498
Because today, state agencies and companies

00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:35.787
want to store as much information as they can get about us,

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:37.667
online and offline.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.874
They want to have the possibility to track our lives,

00:08:41.874 --> 00:08:45.722
and they want to store them for all time.

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:50.165
But self-determination and living in the digital age

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:52.862
is no contradiction.

00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:58.021
But you have to fight for your self-determination today.

00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.048
You have to fight for it every day.

00:09:02.048 --> 00:09:04.810
So, when you go home,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.466
tell your friends

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:10.777
that privacy is a value of the 21st century,

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:13.297
and it's not outdated.

00:09:13.297 --> 00:09:17.363
When you go home, tell your representative

00:09:17.363 --> 00:09:21.842
only because companies and state agencies have the possibility

00:09:21.842 --> 00:09:27.258
to store certain information, they don't have to do it.

00:09:27.258 --> 00:09:29.603
And if you don't believe me,

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:37.226
ask your phone company what information they store about you.

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:44.086
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:47.158
let it be a reminder to you

00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:50.925
that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.

00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:52.150
Thank you.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.298
(Applause)
