00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.762
We've been told to go out on a limb
and say something surprising.

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:31.976
So I'll try and do that,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.496
but I want to start with two things
that everyone already knows.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.781
And the first one, in fact,
is something that has been known

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:44.976
for most of recorded history,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.859
and that is, that the planet Earth,
or the solar system,

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.805
or our environment or whatever,

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.120
is uniquely suited
to sustain our evolution --

00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:01.976
or creation, as it used to be thought --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.426
and our present existence,
and most important, our future survival.

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:13.136
Nowadays, this idea
has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.334
And the idea there
is that outside the spaceship,

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.378
the universe is implacably hostile,

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:23.246
and inside is all we have,
all we depend on,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.396
and we only get the one chance:
if we mess up our spaceship,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.269
we've got nowhere else to go.

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:31.100
Now, the second thing
that everyone already knows

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:36.569
is that, contrary to what was believed
for most of human history,

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:42.032
human beings are not, in fact,
the hub of existence.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:44.652
As Stephen Hawking famously said,

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:49.572
we're just a chemical scum
on the surface of a typical planet

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.882
that's in orbit around a typical star,

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:55.804
which is on the outskirts
of a typical galaxy, and so on.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:01.781
Now, the first of those two things
that everyone knows is kind of saying

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:06.442
that we're at a very un-typical place,
uniquely suited and so on,

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.926
and the second one is saying
that we're at a typical place.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.811
And, especially if you regard
these two as deep truths to live by

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.976
and to inform your life decisions,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.297
then they seem a little bit
to conflict with each other.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.837
But that doesn't prevent them
from both being completely false.

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.242
(Laughter)

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.165
And they are.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.619
So let me start with the second one:

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.151
"Typical." Well, is this a typical place?

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:45.140
Well, let's look around, you know,
look in a random direction,

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:50.753
and we see a wall, and chemical scum --

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:51.976
(Laughter)

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.828
and that's not typical
of the universe at all.

00:02:56.852 --> 00:03:00.275
All you've got to do is go
a few hundred miles in that same direction

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.470
and look back,

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:04.824
and you won't see any walls
or chemical scum at all --

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:06.555
all you see is a blue planet.

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.184
And if you go further than that,

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:13.590
you'll see the Sun, the solar system
and the stars and so on,

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:15.745
but that's still not typical
of the universe,

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.093
because stars come in galaxies.

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:23.895
And most places in the universe,
a typical place in the universe,

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.976
is nowhere near any galaxies.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.527
So let's go out further, till we're
outside the galaxy, and look back,

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:36.409
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy
with spiral arms laid out in front of us.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:42.976
And at this point, we've come
100,000 light-years from here.

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:47.976
But we're still nowhere near
a typical place in the universe.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.749
To get to a typical place,

00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:54.290
you've got to go
1,000 times as far as that,

00:03:54.314 --> 00:03:56.394
into intergalactic space.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.913
And so, what does that
look like -- "typical?"

00:03:59.937 --> 00:04:02.486
What does a "typical" place
in the universe look like?

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.520
Well, at enormous expense,
TED has arranged

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:11.602
a high-resolution immersion
virtual reality rendering

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.976
of the view from intergalactic space.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.844
Can we have the lights off,
please, so we can see it?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.366
Well, not quite, not quite perfect.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.071
You see, intergalactic space
is completely dark, pitch dark.

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.978
It's so dark,

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:40.668
that if you were to be looking
at the nearest star to you,

00:04:40.692 --> 00:04:44.790
and that star were to explode
as a supernova,

00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:49.702
and you were to be staring directly at it
at the moment when its light reached you,

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:52.876
you still wouldn't be able
to see even a glimmer.

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.762
That's how big and how dark
the universe is.

00:04:56.786 --> 00:05:01.547
And that's despite the fact
that a supernova is so bright,

00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.021
so brilliant an event,

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:08.282
that it would kill you stone dead
at a range of several light-years.

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:09.925
(Laughter)

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.864
And yet, from intergalactic space,

00:05:11.888 --> 00:05:14.323
it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.976
It's also very cold out there --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.529
less than three degrees
above absolute zero.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.411
And it's very empty.

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:28.276
The vacuum there is one million times
less dense than the highest vacuum

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.237
that our best technology on Earth
can currently create.

00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:37.976
So that's how different
a typical place is from this place.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.127
And that is how un-typical this place is.

00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:44.222
So can we have the lights
back on please? Thank you.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:51.604
Now, how do we know about an environment
that's so far away and so different

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:54.675
and so alien from anything we're used to?

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.065
Well, the Earth -- our environment,
in the form of us --

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.115
is creating knowledge.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.479
Well, what does that mean?

00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:04.976
Well, look out even further
than we've just been --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.300
I mean from here, with a telescope --

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:11.498
and you'll see things that look
like stars, they're called quasars.

00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:14.735
"Quasars" originally meant
"quasi-stellar object,"

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.502
which means "things that look
a bit like stars."

00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:18.811
(Laughter)

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:20.189
But they're not stars.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.765
And we know what they are.

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:27.829
Billions of years ago
and billions of light-years away,

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:31.976
the material at the center
of a galaxy collapsed

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.371
towards a super-massive black hole.

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.677
And then intense magnetic fields

00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:40.647
directed some of the energy
of that gravitational collapse

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.976
and some of the matter

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.099
back out in the form of tremendous jets,

00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:45.957
which illuminated lobes

00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:50.402
with the brilliance of --
I think it's a trillion -- suns.

00:06:52.886 --> 00:06:57.398
Now, the physics of the human brain
could hardly be more unlike

00:06:57.422 --> 00:06:59.345
the physics of such a jet.

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:01.721
We couldn't survive for an instant in it.

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:04.754
Language breaks down
when trying to describe

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:06.976
what it would be like
in one of those jets.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.058
It would be a bit like experiencing
a supernova explosion,

00:07:10.082 --> 00:07:13.599
but at point-blank range
and for millions of years at a time.

00:07:13.623 --> 00:07:17.150
(Laughter)

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:23.264
And yet, that jet happened
in precisely such a way

00:07:23.288 --> 00:07:27.008
that billions of years later,
on the other side of the universe,

00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:31.174
some bit of chemical scum
could accurately describe

00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:35.188
and model and predict
and explain, above all --

00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:37.338
there's your reference --

00:07:37.362 --> 00:07:41.000
what was happening there, in reality.

00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:46.307
The one physical system, the brain,
contains an accurate working model

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.179
of the other, the quasar.

00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:51.778
Not just a superficial image of it,
though it contains that as well,

00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:53.783
but an explanatory model,

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.854
embodying the same
mathematical relationships

00:07:56.878 --> 00:07:59.306
and the same causal structure.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.368
Now, that is knowledge.

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.976
And if that weren't amazing enough,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.976
the faithfulness with which
the one structure resembles the other

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.083
is increasing with time.

00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:12.580
That is the growth of knowledge.

00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:15.976
So, the laws of physics
have this special property,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.757
that physical objects as unlike each other
as they could possibly be,

00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:26.525
can nevertheless embody the same
mathematical and causal structure

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.371
and to do it more and more so over time.

00:08:30.068 --> 00:08:33.240
So we are a chemical scum
that is different.

00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:36.437
This chemical scum has universality.

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:41.248
Its structure contains,
with ever-increasing precision,

00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:42.702
the structure of everything.

00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:46.430
This place, and not other places
in the universe,

00:08:46.454 --> 00:08:52.530
is a hub which contains within itself
the structural and causal essence

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:55.291
of the whole of the rest
of physical reality.

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:57.163
And so, far from being insignificant,

00:08:57.187 --> 00:08:59.891
the fact that the laws
of physics allow this

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.366
or even mandate that this can happen,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.482
is one of the most important things
about the physical world.

00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:13.643
Now how does the solar system --
our environment, in the form of us --

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:17.048
acquire this special relationship
with the rest of the universe?

00:09:17.072 --> 00:09:21.890
Well, one thing that's true
about Stephen Hawking's remark --

00:09:21.914 --> 00:09:25.429
I mean, it is true,
but it's the wrong emphasis.

00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:31.902
One thing that's true about it is that
it doesn't do it with any special physics,

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:34.917
there's no special dispensation,
no miracles involved.

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.976
It does it simply with three things
that we have here in abundance.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.650
One of them is matter,

00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:45.730
because the growth of knowledge
is a form of information processing.

00:09:45.754 --> 00:09:49.691
Information processing is computation,
computation requires a computer --

00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:52.714
there's no known way of making
a computer without matter.

00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:56.213
We also need energy to make
the computer, and most important,

00:09:56.237 --> 00:10:00.207
to make the media, in effect,
onto which we record

00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:01.976
the knowledge that we discover.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.141
And then thirdly,
less tangible but just as essential

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:10.363
for the open-ended creation
of knowledge, of explanations,

00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.364
is evidence.

00:10:14.142 --> 00:10:17.323
Now, our environment
is inundated with evidence.

00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:22.976
We happen to get round to testing,
let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.729
about 300 years ago.

00:10:24.753 --> 00:10:28.092
But the evidence that we used to do that

00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:31.405
was falling down on every
square meter of the Earth

00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:33.082
for billions of years before that,

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:36.923
and will continue to fall
for billions of years afterwards.

00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:39.976
And the same is true
for all the other sciences.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.976
As far as we know, evidence to discover
the most fundamental truths

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.976
of all the sciences is here just
for the taking, on our planet.

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:52.162
Our location is saturated with evidence

00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:54.618
and also with matter and energy.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.880
Out in intergalactic space,

00:10:56.904 --> 00:11:00.293
those three prerequisites
for the open-ended creation of knowledge

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:02.737
are at their lowest possible supply --

00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:06.353
as I said, it's empty, it's cold
and it's dark out there.

00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:08.646
Or is it?

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:12.946
Now actually, that's just
another parochial misconception.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.045
(Laughter)

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:19.040
Because imagine a cube out there
in intergalactic space,

00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:22.725
the same size as our home,
the solar system.

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.976
Now that cube is very empty
by human standards,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.976
but that still means that it contains
over a million tons of matter.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.976
And a million tons is enough to make,
say, a self-contained space station,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.350
on which there's a colony of scientists

00:11:38.374 --> 00:11:42.410
that are devoted to creating an open-ended
stream of knowledge, and so on.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:44.884
Now, it's way beyond present technology

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:49.034
to even gather the hydrogen
from intergalactic space

00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:52.236
and form it into other elements and so on.

00:11:52.872 --> 00:11:55.800
But the thing is,
in a comprehensible universe,

00:11:55.824 --> 00:11:59.190
if something isn't forbidden
by the laws of physics,

00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:03.359
then what could possibly prevent us
from doing it, other than knowing how?

00:12:03.383 --> 00:12:06.760
In other words, it's a matter
of knowledge, not resources.

00:12:06.784 --> 00:12:10.395
If we could do that, we'd automatically
have an energy supply,

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:13.863
because this transmutation
would be a fusion reactor.

00:12:13.887 --> 00:12:15.624
And evidence?

00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:18.823
Well, again, it's dark out there
to human senses,

00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:20.966
but all you've got to do
is take a telescope,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.133
even one of present-day design,

00:12:23.157 --> 00:12:27.573
look out, and you'll see
the same galaxies as we do from here.

00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:29.943
And with a more powerful telescope,

00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:32.689
you'll be able to see stars
and planets in those galaxies,

00:12:32.713 --> 00:12:36.123
you'll be able to do astrophysics
and learn the laws of physics.

00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:38.787
And locally there you could build
particle accelerators,

00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:42.048
and learn elementary particle physics
and chemistry, and so on.

00:12:42.072 --> 00:12:46.530
Probably the hardest science to do
would be biology field trips --

00:12:46.554 --> 00:12:47.871
(Laughter)

00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:50.834
because it would take
several hundred million years

00:12:50.858 --> 00:12:54.177
to get to the nearest
life-bearing planet and back.

00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:56.483
But I have to tell you --
and sorry, Richard --

00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:59.841
but I never did like biology
field trips much,

00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:01.173
(Laughter)

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.193
and I think we can just about make do

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:05.317
with one every few hundred million years.

00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:07.358
(Laughter)

00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:14.338
So in fact, intergalactic space
does contain all the prerequisites

00:13:14.362 --> 00:13:16.742
for the open-ended creation of knowledge.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.426
Any such cube anywhere in the universe

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.035
could become the same kind
of hub that we are,

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:29.909
if the knowledge of how to do so
were present there.

00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:34.146
So, we're not in a uniquely
hospitable place.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.684
If intergalactic space
is capable of creating

00:13:36.708 --> 00:13:39.294
an open-ended stream of explanations,

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.485
then so is almost every other environment,

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:42.739
so is the Earth.

00:13:42.763 --> 00:13:45.093
So is a polluted Earth.

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:49.186
And the limiting factor, there and here,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.066
is not resources,
because they're plentiful,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.240
but knowledge, which is scarce.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:14:00.579
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view
may -- and I think ought to --

00:14:00.603 --> 00:14:02.919
make us feel very special.

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.561
But it should also
make us feel vulnerable,

00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:09.000
because it means that
without the specific knowledge

00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:12.771
that's needed to survive
the ongoing challenges of the universe,

00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:13.976
we won't survive them.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.485
All it takes is for a supernova
to go off a few light-years away,

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:18.914
and we'll all be dead!

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:21.653
Martin Rees has recently written a book

00:14:21.677 --> 00:14:24.976
about our vulnerability
to all sorts of things,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.976
from astrophysics, to scientific
experiments gone wrong,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.350
and most importantly, to terrorism
with weapons of mass destruction.

00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:36.801
And he thinks that civilization
has only a 50 percent chance

00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.252
of surviving this century.

00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:41.411
I think he's going to talk
about that later in the conference.

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:46.583
Now, I don't think that probability
is the right category

00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:47.976
to discuss this issue in,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.735
but I do agree with him about this:

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:53.924
We can survive and we can fail to survive.

00:14:54.502 --> 00:14:57.247
But it depends not on chance,

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:00.976
but on whether we create
the relevant knowledge in time.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.802
The danger is not at all unprecedented.

00:15:03.826 --> 00:15:07.047
Species go extinct all the time.

00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.229
Civilizations end.

00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:12.689
The overwhelming majority
of all species and all civilizations

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:15.298
that have ever existed are now history.

00:15:15.322 --> 00:15:18.196
And if we want to be
the exception to that,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:24.119
then logically, our only hope
is to make use of the one feature

00:15:24.143 --> 00:15:28.767
that distinguishes our species
and civilization from all the others --

00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:33.238
namely, our special relationship
with the laws of physics,

00:15:33.262 --> 00:15:37.735
our ability to create
new explanations, new knowledge --

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.530
to be a hub of existence.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:44.639
So let me now apply this
to a current controversy,

00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:47.878
not because I want to advocate
any particular solution,

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:50.536
but just to illustrate
the kind of thing I mean.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.976
And the controversy is global warming.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.005
Now, I'm a physicist,
but I'm not the right kind of physicist.

00:15:56.029 --> 00:15:59.763
In regard to global warming,
I'm just a layman.

00:15:59.787 --> 00:16:02.618
And the rational thing for a layman to do

00:16:02.642 --> 00:16:07.143
is to take seriously
the prevailing scientific theory.

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:11.834
And according to that theory,
it's already too late to avoid a disaster,

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:17.626
because if it's true that our best option
at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.520
with something like the Kyoto Protocol,

00:16:19.544 --> 00:16:23.361
with its constraints on economic activity
and its enormous cost

00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:25.976
of hundreds of billions of dollars,
or whatever it is,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.057
then that is already a disaster
by any reasonable measure.

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:36.451
And the actions that are advocated are not
even purported to solve the problem,

00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:38.855
merely to postpone it by a little.

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:40.664
So it's already too late to avoid it,

00:16:40.688 --> 00:16:43.572
and it probably has been
too late to avoid it

00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:47.417
ever since before anyone
realized the danger.

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:50.505
It was probably already
too late in the 1970s,

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:53.724
when the best available
scientific theory was telling us

00:16:53.748 --> 00:16:57.262
that industrial emissions were
about to precipitate a new ice age,

00:16:57.286 --> 00:16:59.404
in which billions would die.

00:17:00.312 --> 00:17:02.471
Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me,

00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:06.082
and I don't know why it isn't
informing public debate.

00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:09.412
It is that we can't always know.

00:17:09.436 --> 00:17:12.070
When we know of an impending disaster,

00:17:12.094 --> 00:17:16.696
and how to solve it at a cost less
than the cost of the disaster itself,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.592
then there's not going to be
much argument, really.

00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:24.185
But no precautions
and no precautionary principle

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:28.411
can avoid problems
that we do not yet foresee.

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:33.420
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,

00:17:33.444 --> 00:17:36.045
not just problem-avoidance.

00:17:36.712 --> 00:17:40.096
And it's true that an ounce of prevention
equals a pound of cure,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.048
but that's only if we know
what to prevent.

00:17:43.072 --> 00:17:45.033
If you've been punched on the nose,

00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:48.192
then the science of medicine
does not consist of teaching you

00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:49.574
how to avoid punches.

00:17:49.598 --> 00:17:50.613
(Laughter)

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:55.976
If medical science stopped seeking cures
and concentrated on prevention only,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.747
then it would achieve
very little of either.

00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:00.796
The world is buzzing at the moment

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.527
with plans to force reductions
in gas emissions at all costs.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.229
It ought to be buzzing with plans
to reduce the temperature,

00:18:10.253 --> 00:18:13.264
and with plans to live
at the higher temperature --

00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:16.508
and not at all costs,
but efficiently and cheaply.

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:17.859
And some such plans exist,

00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:22.095
things like swarms of mirrors in space
to deflect the sunlight away,

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:25.976
and encouraging aquatic organisms
to eat more carbon dioxide.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.288
At the moment, these things
are fringe research;

00:18:29.312 --> 00:18:33.017
they're not central to the human effort
to face this problem,

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.659
or problems in general.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.771
And with problems
that we are not aware of yet,

00:18:37.795 --> 00:18:43.954
the ability to put right -- not the sheer
good luck of avoiding indefinitely --

00:18:43.978 --> 00:18:46.771
is our only hope, not just
of solving problems,

00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:48.229
but of survival.

00:18:48.671 --> 00:18:55.155
So take two stone tablets,
and carve on them.

00:18:56.057 --> 00:19:00.427
On one of them, carve:
"Problems are soluble."

00:19:00.763 --> 00:19:04.944
And on the other one, carve:
"Problems are inevitable."

00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:06.555
Thank you.

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:07.729
(Applause)
