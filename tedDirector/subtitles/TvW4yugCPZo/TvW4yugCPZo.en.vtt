00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
40 percent of all post-conflict situations,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Why has the record been so poor?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Well, the conventional approach

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
to post-conflict situations

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
has rested on, on kind of, three principles.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
The first principle is: it's the politics that matters.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
So, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Try and build a political settlement first.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And then the second step is to say,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
So, short-term peacekeepers.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
It's an election.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.160
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
So that's the conventional approach.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I think that approach denies reality.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
We see that there is no quick fix.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
There's certainly no quick security fix.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
during our post-conflict decade.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
What an election produces is a winner and a loser.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.160
And the loser is unreconciled.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
It's not the politics first;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
it's actually the politics last.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
The politics become easier as the decade progresses

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
if you're building on a foundation

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.160
of security and economic development --

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
the rebuilding of prosperity.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
Why does the politics get easier?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
And why is it so difficult initially?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Because after years of stagnation and decline,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.160
the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
If the reality is stagnation,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
I can only go up if you go down.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And that doesn't produce a productive politics.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And so the mentality has to shift from

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
zero-sum to positive-sum

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
before you can get a productive politics.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
You can only get positive, that mental shift,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
if the reality is that prosperity is being built.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
So that is what you get when you face reality.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
But the objective of facing reality

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
is to change reality.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
And so now let me suggest

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160
two complimentary approaches

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
to changing the reality of the situations.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
The first is to recognize the interdependence

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.160
of three key actors, who are different actors,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
and at the moment are uncoordinated.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
The first actor is the Security Council.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160
The Security Council typically has the responsibility

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
for providing the peacekeepers

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
who build the security.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
And that needs to be recognized,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
first of all, that peacekeeping works.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
It is a cost-effective approach.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
It does increase security.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
But it needs to be done long-term.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
It needs to be a decade-long approach,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
rather than just a couple of years.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
That's one actor, the Security Council.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
The second actor, different cast of guys,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
is the donors.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
The donors provide post-conflict aid.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Typically in the past,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
the donors have been interested in the first couple of years,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and then they got bored.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
They moved on to some other situation.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
Post-conflict economic recovery

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
is a slow process.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
There are no quick processes in economics

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
except decline.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
You can do that quite fast.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
(Laughter)

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
So the donors have to stick with this situation

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
for at least a decade.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
And then the third key actor

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
is the post-conflict government.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And there are two key things it's got to do.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
One is it's got to do economic reform,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
not fuss about the political constitution.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
It's got to reform economic policy.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
Why? Because during conflict

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
economic policy typically deteriorates.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Governments snatch short-term opportunities

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
bringing people inside the tent.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
So those three actors.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
And they are interdependent

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
over a long term.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
If the Security Council doesn't commit to security

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
over the course of a decade,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
you don't get the economic recovery,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.160
which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
So we should recognize that interdependence,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
by formal, mutual commitments.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
The United Nations actually has a language

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.160
it's called the language of compact.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
And so we need a post-conflict compact.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
it's called the Peace Building Commission.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
where, when we got to a post-conflict situation,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
there was an expectation of these mutual commitments

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
from the three parties.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
So that's idea one:

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
recognize interdependence.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:23.160
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
of different actors with different priorities.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
you get a very unfocused agenda,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
because in these situations, needs are everywhere,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
but the capacity to implement change is very limited.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.160
So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
three things are critical.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
One is jobs.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
One is improvements in basic services --

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
especially health, which is a disaster during conflict.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
So jobs, health, and clean government.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.160
Those are the three critical priorities.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
Jobs.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
What is a distinctive approach

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
to generating jobs in post-conflict situations?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
And why are jobs so important?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
In post-conflict situations,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
the reason that they so often revert to conflict,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
is not because elderly women get upset.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
It's because young men get upset.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And so we need a process of generating jobs,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
for ordinary young men, fast.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Now, that is difficult.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Governments in post-conflict situation

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160
often respond by puffing up the civil service.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
That is not a good idea.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
It's not sustainable.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
In fact, you're building a long-term liability

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
by inflating civil service.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.160
because any activity which is open to international trade

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
is basically going to be uncompetitive

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
in a post-conflict situation.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
and which can generate a lot of jobs,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and which is, in any case, a sensible sector

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
to expand, post-conflict,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
and that is the construction sector.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
The construction sector has a vital role,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
obviously, in reconstruction.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.160
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
During conflict people are doing destruction.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
And then when you try and expand it,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
because it's shriveled away,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
you encounter a lot of bottlenecks.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
Basically, prices soar

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
but it doesn't generate any jobs.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
in expanding the construction sector.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
What might the bottlenecks be?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
Just think what you have to do

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
First you need access to land.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
Often the legal system is broken down

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
so you can't even get access to land.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160
Secondly you need skills,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
the mundane skills of the construction sector.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
we need Bricklayers Without Borders,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
to rebuild the skill set.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
We need firms. The firms have gone away.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
If we do that, we not only get the jobs,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
we get the improvements in public infrastructure,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160
the restoration of public infrastructure.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.160
Let me turn from jobs to the second objective,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
which is improving basic social services.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.160
And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
in the donor community,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
as to how to build basic services

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
in post-conflict sectors.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
On the one hand it pays lip service

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
to the idea of rebuild an effective state

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
that deliver these services.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
donors know that's not a realistic agenda,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
and so what they also do is the total bypass:

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.160
just fund NGOs.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
Neither of those approaches is sensible.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
And so what I'd suggest

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
is what I call Independent Service Authorities.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.160
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
the delivery of services on the ground,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
you should use whatever works --

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
churches, NGOs, local communities,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
whatever works.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And in between, there should be a public agency,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
the Independent Service Authority,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
which channels public money,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
and especially donor money,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
to the retail providers.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.160
So the NGOs become part of a public government system,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
rather than independent of it.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
You can use yardstick competition,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
so they have to compete against each other

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
for the resources.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.160
They want to have the discipline and accountability.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
And because the government would be funding it,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
it would be co-branding these services.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160
the United States government and some NGO.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.160
They would be co-branded

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.160
So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
Clean means follow their money.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.160
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
that it needs our money

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
just to be on a life-support system.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
You can't get the basic functions of the state done

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160
unless we put money into the core budget of these countries.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
But, if we put money into the core budget,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:08.160
we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
that mean that money will be well spent.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
it's not just that the money is wasted --

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160
that's the least of the problems --

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
it's that the money is captured.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.160
It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.160
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
So building clean government means, yes, provide money

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
to the budget,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.160
but also provide a lot of scrutiny,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.160
Paddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
to the United Nations,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
in his book about his experience, he said,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
"I realize what I needed

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
was accountants without borders,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
to follow that money."

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
So that's the -- let me wrap up,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
this is the package.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
What's the goal?

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.160
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
That after 10 years,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
the focus on the construction sector

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
would have produced both jobs

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
and, hence, security --

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
because young people would have jobs --

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
So that's the focus on the construction sector.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
The focus on the basic service delivery

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
through these independent service authorities

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
would have rescued basic services

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
from their catastrophic levels,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
and it would have given ordinary people

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.160
the sense that the government was doing something useful.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
The emphasis on clean government

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.160
because there wouldn't be any money

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
in taking part in the politics.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160
And so gradually the selection,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
the composition of politicians,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.160
would shift from the crooked to the honest.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
Where would that leave us?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Gradually it would shift

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
from a politics of plunder

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
to a politics of hope. Thank you.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.160
