00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I guess the story actually has to start

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
maybe back in the the 1960s,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
when I was seven or eight years old,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
with my mask and flippers on.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
because that's all there was to look at.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And by the time I turned 16,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I pursued a career in marine science,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in exploration and diving,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
for 30 days total.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
operated by the Japanese government.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And Sylvia Earle and I

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
were on an expedition in this submarine

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
20 years ago in Japan.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
to an area that I thought

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
But when I got there, I found

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
lots of plastic garbage and other debris.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And it was really a turning point in my life,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
where I started to realize

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I needed to put it into a context.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I needed to head towards conservation goals.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
So I began to work

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
with National Geographic Society and others

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and led expeditions to Antarctica.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Ten years ago was a seminal trip,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And we developed techniques

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to dive inside and under the iceberg,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
such as heating pads on our kidneys

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
with a battery that we dragged around,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
it would get a little boost of warmth

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
before going back into our bodies.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
But after three trips to Antarctica,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
And that same year, 10 years ago,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
You may have seen this in other forms,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
but the top line is the amount of protected area

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
on land, globally,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
and it's about 12 percent.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
around the 1960s and '70s,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And that's probably because

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that's when everybody got aware of the environment

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and Earth Day

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
But the ocean-protected area

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is basically flat line

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
of the protected area in the ocean.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
if we could see what happens in the ocean

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
like we can see what happens on land.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and we can't see what's going on.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And therefore we're way behind on protection.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
But scuba diving, submersibles

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and all the work that we're setting about to do here

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
will help rectify that.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
So where are the Phoenix Islands?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
They were the world's largest marine-protected area

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
up until last week

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
it's five days from Fiji,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It's out in the middle of the Pacific,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
right around the Equator.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
They've never been dived."

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And I said, "Yeah.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
So that's when I first learned of the Islands

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and had no idea what I was getting into.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But I was in for the adventure.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
which are specifically part of the protected area.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
It's an interesting fact.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
very deep three-dimensional space

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
with herds of tuna, whales,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
all kinds of deep sea marine life

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
like we've seen here before.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
That's the vessel that we took up there

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
for these studies, early on,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
They're very low to the water,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and they're all uninhabited, except one island

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
has about 35 caretakers on it.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And they've been uninhabited for most of time

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
because even in the ancient days,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
these islands were too far away

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
for those ancient Polynesian mariners

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
that were traversing the Pacific so widely.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
But we got up there,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
to get to a place that had never been dived

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Let's try there,"

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and then falling into the water.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Both my personal and my professional life changed.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Suddenly, I saw a world

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
that I had never seen before in the ocean --

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
schools of fish that were so dense

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
coral reefs that were continuous

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and solid and colorful,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
large fish everywhere,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
manta rays.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
You can see the fish are balled up

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and then there's a little cloudy area there

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
events that the ocean is supposed to do,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
but struggles to do in many places now

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
because of human activity.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
are very important for tuna fisheries,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
up to 150 sharks at once,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
which is an indication

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
So I thought the scenes

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
of never-ending wilderness

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
would go on forever,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
but they did finally come to an end.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
very important bird nesting site,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And we finished our trip.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And that's the area again.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
that pop out of the water.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Where do these exist?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
in three island groups.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
which is the subject that I'm talking about.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
It's the largest atoll nation in the world.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And they have

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
about 110,000 people

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
spread out over 33 islands.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and that's between one and two percent

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
of all the ocean water on the planet.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And when I was first going up there,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and people would ask me,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And it reminded me of that old joke

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is."

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Because that's where all the ocean is."

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
They basically are one nation

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that controls most of the equatorial waters

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of the Central Pacific Ocean.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
They're also a country

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
that is in dire danger.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Sea levels are rising,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
will be under water within 50 to 100 years

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
due to climate change

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The Islands rise only one to two meters

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
above the surface.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Some of the islands have already gone under water.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And these nations are faced with a real problem.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
We as a world are faced with a problem.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
who no longer have a home on the planet?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
The president of the Maldives

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
conducted a mock cabinet meeting

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
underwater recently

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to highlight the dire straits of these countries.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So it's something we need to focus on.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
But back to the Phoenix Islands,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
which is the subject of this Talk.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
After I got back, I said,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
okay, this is amazing, what we found.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
who are over in Tarawa,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
the westernmost group.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
So I started contacting them --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
because they had actually given me a permit to do this --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And for some reason they didn't want me to come,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
But if you come, you have to buy lunch

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
for everybody who comes to the seminar."

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
Just get whatever anybody wants."

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and we presented for two hours

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and he said, "Greg, do you realize

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
that you are the first scientist

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
who has ever come back

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and told us what they did?"

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
He said, "We often issue these permits

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
to do research in our waters,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
but usually we get a note two or three years later,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
or a reprint.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And are you free for dinner?"

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And I was free for dinner,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And over the course of dinner,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
it's a very poor country --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
but it gains what revenue is has

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
by selling access to foreign nations

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
to take fish out of its waters,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
because Kiribati does not have the capacity

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
to take the fish itself.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And the deal that they strike

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
is the extracting country

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
gives Kiribati five percent

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
of the landed value.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
So if the United States

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
removes a million dollars'

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
worth of lobsters from a reef,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
So I asked the Minister over dinner,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
I said, "Would you consider a situation

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
where you would still get paid --

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
but you leave fish and the sharks

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
and the shrimp in the water?"

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
to deal with our overfishing problem,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
He coined the term "reverse fishing license."

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So we walked away from this dinner

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
really not knowing where to go at that point.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
I went back to the States and started looking around

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
to see if I could find examples

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
where reverse fishing licenses

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
had been issued,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and it turned out there were none.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
There were no oceanic deals

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
where countries were compensated for not fishing.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
It had occurred on land,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
in rainforests of South America and Africa,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
where landowners had been paid

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
not to cut the trees down.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
So I went to Conservation International

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and brought them in as a partner

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
and went through the process

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
of valuing the fishery resource,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
what the range of the fishes were,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
brought in a whole bunch of other partners --

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
the government of Australia,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
have been big funders of this as well.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
And we basically founded the park

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
on the idea of an endowment

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
to this very poor country

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
to keep the area intact.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
President Anote Tong.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
He's a really important leader,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
a real visionary, forward-thinking man,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
and he told me two things when I approached him.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
One is, remember I'm a politician,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
so you've got to go out and work with my ministers

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that will transcend my own presidency.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
I don't want to do something like this

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
that this was in their own self-interest to do this.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
They realized that this was a common cause

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
that they had found

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
with the conservation community.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
Then in 2002,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
when this was all going full-swing,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Here's this resource that we're looking to save,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
and it turns out it's the hottest heating event

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
that we can find on record.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and the hot spot formed and stalled

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
and it basically killed

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
60 percent of the coral.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Well, the good news is it's recovered

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and recovering fast,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
faster than any reef we've seen.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
when we returned to the Phoenix Islands

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
and discovered that, because it is a protected area

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
and has healthy fish populations

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
that keep the algae grazed down

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and keep the rest of the reef healthy,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
the coral is booming, is just booming back.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
It's almost like if a person

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
has multiple diseases,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
it's hard to get well, you might die,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And that's the story with climate-change heating.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
It's the only threat,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
the only influence that the reef had to deal with.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and the reef is on a full-bore recovery.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
might embrace this idea, Minister."

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
He paused and put his hands together and said,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
"Yes, Greg,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
but the devil will be in the details," he said.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And it certainly was.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
The last 10 years have been detail after detail

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
ranging from creating legislation

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
to multiple research expeditions

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
to communication plans,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
as I said, teams of lawyers,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
MOUs,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
at its current state while we raise the endowment.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
So it's a fully functional

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
up-and-running entity

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and pays the country for this.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
So it's a very solid, very well thought-out,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
very well grounded system,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and it was a bottom-up system,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and that was very important with this work,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
from the bottom up to secure this.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
So the conditions for success here are listed.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
You can read them yourselves.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
But I would say the most important one in my mind

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
was working within the market forces

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
of the situation.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
And that insured that we could move this forward

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
as well as the self-interest of the world.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And I'll leave you with one final slide,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that is: how do we scale this up?

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
How do we realize Sylvia's dream?

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Where eventually do we take this?

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
Here's the Pacific

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
with large MPAs

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
and large conservation zones on it.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
And as you can see,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
we have a patchwork across this ocean.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
I've just described to you the one story

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
but every other green patch on that

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
has its own story.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And what we need to do now

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
is look at the whole Pacific Ocean

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.260
in its entirety

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
and make a network of MPAs

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
across the Pacific

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
so that we have our world's largest ocean

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
protected and self-sustaining

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
over time.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
Thank you very much. (Applause)
