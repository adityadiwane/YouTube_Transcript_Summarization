00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:14.770
I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:18.368
and I sort of came like a forest gnome
to New York City a while back.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:19.526
(Laughter)

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.334
Really messed with my head,
but I'll get into that later.

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.395
I'll start with when
I was eight years old.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.655
I took a wood box,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.774
and I buried a dollar bill, a pen
and a fork inside this box in Colorado.

00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:40.715
And I thought some strange humanoids
or aliens in 500 years would find this box

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.265
and learn about the way
our species exchanged ideas,

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.323
maybe how we ate our spaghetti.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.679
I really didn't know.

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:50.838
Anyway, this is kind of funny,

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:55.209
because here I am, 30 years later,
and I'm still making boxes.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.272
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:01.798
I like to hike and surf
and do all that weird stuff,

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.914
and I was making a collage for my ma.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.438
And I took a dictionary
and I ripped it up,

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.197
and I made it into a sort
of Agnes Martin grid,

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.792
and I poured resin all over it
and a bee got stuck.

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:14.534
Now, she's afraid of bees
and she's allergic to them,

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:18.793
so I poured more resin on the canvas,
thinking I could hide it or something.

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.357
Instead, the opposite happened:

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:22.063
It sort of created a magnification,

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:24.475
like a magnifying glass,
on the dictionary text.

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.500
So what did I do? I built more boxes.

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.862
This time, I started putting
electronics, frogs,

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:35.433
strange bottles I'd find in the street --
anything I could find --

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:37.806
because I was always
finding things my whole life,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.468
and trying to make relationships
and tell stories between these objects.

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:44.277
So I started drawing around the objects,

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.613
and I realized: Holy moly,
I can draw in space!

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:49.636
I can make free-floating lines,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.683
like the way you would draw
around a dead body at a crime scene.

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:53.983
So I took the objects out,

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.972
and I created my own taxonomy
of invented specimens.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.774
First, botanical --
which you can kind of get a sense of.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.660
Then I made some
weird insects and creatures.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.866
It was really fun; I was just
drawing on the layers of resin.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.348
And it was cool, because I was actually
starting to have shows and stuff,

00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:15.344
I was making some money,
I could take my girlfriend for dinner,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.623
and like, go to Sizzler.

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:18.052
It was some good shit, man.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.704
(Laughter)

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:23.634
At some point, I got up to the human form,

00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:28.285
life-size resin sculptures
with drawings of humans inside the layers.

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.768
This was great, except for one thing:

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.042
I was going to die.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:35.599
I didn't know what to do,
because the resin was going to kill me.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:37.936
And I went to bed every night
thinking about it.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.452
So I tried using glass.

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:42.465
I started drawing on the layers of glass,

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.561
almost like if you drew on a window,
then you put another window,

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:48.328
and another window, and you had
all these windows together

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:50.487
that made a three-dimensional composition.

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:53.444
And this really worked,
because I could stop using the resin.

00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:55.318
So I did this for years,

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.777
which culminated in a very large work,
which I call "The Triptych."

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:02.048
"The Triptych" was largely inspired

00:03:02.072 --> 00:03:05.009
by Hieronymus Bosch's
"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.657
which is a painting
in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:09.380
Do you guys know this painting?

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:10.697
Good, it's a cool painting.

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.695
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.210
So, "The Triptych."
I'll walk you through this piece.

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.532
It weighs 24,000 pounds.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:20.882
It's 18 feet long.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:23.657
It's double-sided,
so it's 36 feet of composition.

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.839
It's kind of weird.

00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:29.060
Well, that's the blood fountain.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.297
(Laughter)

00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:33.540
To the left, you have
Jesus and the locusts.

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:35.679
There's a cave

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.950
where all these animal-headed creatures
travel between two worlds.

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.896
They go from the representational world,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.804
to this analog-mesh underworld,
where they're hiding.

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:46.891
This is where the animal-headed creatures
are by the lighthouse,

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:49.754
and they're all about to commit
mass suicide into the ocean.

00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:52.746
The ocean is made up
of thousands of elements.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.069
This is a bird god
tied up to a battleship.

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:56.131
(Laughter)

00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:57.759
Billy Graham is in the ocean;

00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:02.010
the Horizon from the oil spill;
Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --

00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:04.377
there's all kinds of weird stuff
that you can find

00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:06.368
if you look really hard, in the ocean.

00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:09.160
Anyway, this is a lady creature.

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:12.634
She's coming out of the ocean,
and she's spitting oil into one hand

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:15.175
and she has clouds
coming out of her other hand.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.806
Her hands are like scales,

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.468
and she has the mythological reference
of the Earth and cosmos in balance.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.881
So that's one side of "The Triptych."

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:25.365
It's a little narrative thing.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.469
That's her hand that she's spitting into.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.106
And then, when you go to the other side,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.239
she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,

00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:34.297
and she's spitting clouds
out of her trunk.

00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:38.357
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's
tail that connects "The Triptych."

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.735
Anyway, her tail catches on fire
from the back of the volcano.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.836
(Laughter)

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.548
I don't know why that happened.

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:46.130
(Laughter)

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:47.629
That happens, you know.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:51.945
Her tail terminates
in a cycloptic eyeball,

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.500
made out of 1986 terrorist cards.

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:55.729
Have you guys seen those?

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:59.151
They were made in the 1980's,
they're like baseball cards of terrorists.

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:00.334
Way ahead of their time.

00:05:00.358 --> 00:05:02.691
(Laughter)

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.712
That will bring you to my latest project.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.389
I'm in the middle of two projects:

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:08.033
One's called "Psychogeographies."

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.137
It's about a six-year project
to make 100 of these humans.

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.531
Each one is an archive of our culture,

00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:15.554
through our ripped-up media and matter,

00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:18.862
whether it's encyclopedias
or dictionaries or magazines.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:22.059
But each one acts as a sort of an archive
in the shape of a human,

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:25.492
and they travel in groups
of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:28.457
They're like cells --
they come together, they divide.

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.462
And you kind of walk through them.
It's taking me years.

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:35.471
Each one is basically
a 3,000-pound microscope slide

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.432
with a human stuck inside.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:40.243
This one has a little cave in his chest.

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:43.974
That's his head; there's the chest,
you can kind of see the beginning.

00:05:43.998 --> 00:05:46.029
I'm going to go down the body for you:

00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:50.091
There's a waterfall
coming out of his chest,

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.719
covering his penis -- or not-penis,
or whatever it is,

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:54.225
a kind of androgynous thing.

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:57.544
I'll take you quickly through these works,

00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:00.425
because I can't explain them for too long.

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.852
There are the layers,
you can kind of see it.

00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:06.002
That's a body getting split in half.

00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.598
This one has two heads,

00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:09.812
and it's communicating
between the two heads.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.095
You can see the pills coming out,

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.460
going into one head
from this weird statue.

00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:17.315
There's a little forest scene
inside the chest cavity.

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:18.497
Can you see that?

00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:20.608
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,

00:06:20.632 --> 00:06:22.150
like the boxes we're in.

00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:25.329
This box we're in,
the solar system is a box.

00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:27.742
This brings you to my latest box.

00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:30.833
It's a brick box.
It's called Pioneer Works.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.170
(Cheers)

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:36.706
Inside of this box is a physicist,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.856
a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.207
a writer, a radio station,
a museum, a school,

00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:50.388
a publishing arm to disseminate all
the content we make there into the world;

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:51.569
a garden.

00:06:52.132 --> 00:06:53.529
We shake this box up,

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:56.804
and all these people kind of start
hitting each other like particles.

00:06:56.828 --> 00:06:59.127
And I think that's the way
you change the world.

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.033
You redefine your insides
and the box that you're living in.

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:06.621
And you come together to realize
that we're all in this together,

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:08.391
that this delusion of difference --

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:13.485
this idea of countries, of borders,
of religion -- doesn't work.

00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:18.560
We're all really made up
of the same stuff, in the same box.

00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:22.608
And if we don't start
exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.751
we're all going to die real soon.

00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:26.489
Thank you very much.

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:30.023
(Applause)
