00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.109
So we all have our own biases.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.784
For example, some of us tend to think

00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:21.417
that it's very difficult to transform
failing government systems.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.618
When we think of government systems,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.233
we tend to think that they're archaic,
set in their ways,

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:29.953
and perhaps, the leadership
is just too bureaucratic

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:31.382
to be able to change things.

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:35.112
Well, today, I want
to challenge that theory.

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:39.955
I want to tell you a story
of a very large government system

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.423
that has not only put itself
on the path of reform

00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:46.636
but has also shown
fairly spectacular results

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.995
in less than three years.

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:53.026
This is what a classroom
in a public school in India looks like.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.402
There are 1 million such schools in India.

00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:59.010
And even for me,
who's lived in India all her life,

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:02.081
walking into one of these schools
is fairly heartbreaking.

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.175
By the time kids are 11,

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.231
50 percent of them have fallen
so far behind in their education

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.995
that they have no hope to recover.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:14.404
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:17.310
they cannot construct
a grammatically correct sentence.

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.042
These are things that you and I
would expect an 8-year-old

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.334
to be able to do.

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:25.469
By the time kids are 13 or 14,

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:27.273
they tend to drop out of schools.

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:31.587
In India, public schools
not only offer free education --

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.024
they offer free textbooks,
free workbooks, free meals,

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:37.118
sometimes even cash scholarships.

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:40.676
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.880
are choosing to pull their children
out of public schools

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:47.421
and pay out of their pockets
to put them in private schools.

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:51.110
As a comparison,
in a far richer country, the US,

00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:53.055
that number is only 10 percent.

00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:58.330
That's a huge statement on how broken
the Indian public education system is.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.907
So it was with that background
that I got a call in the summer of 2013

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:07.754
from an absolutely brilliant lady
called Surina Rajan.

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:11.895
She was, at that time, the head
of the Department of School Education

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.185
in a state called Haryana in India.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.280
So she said to us, "Look, I've been
heading this department

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.530
for the last two years.

00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:21.985
I've tried a number of things,
and nothing seems to work.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.470
Can you possibly help?"

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:27.666
Let me describe Haryana
a little bit to you.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.049
Haryana is a state
which has 30 million people.

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:34.892
It has 15,000 public schools

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.751
and 2 million plus
children in those public schools.

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.563
So basically, with that phone call,

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.009
I promised to help a state and system

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:47.356
which was as large as that of Peru
or Canada transform itself.

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:52.168
As I started this project,
I was very painfully aware of two things.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.403
One, that I had never done
anything like this before.

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:59.802
And two, many others had,
perhaps without too much success.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.009
As my colleagues and I
looked across the country

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.341
and across the world,

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:06.233
we couldn't find another example

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:09.083
that we could just pick up
and replicate in Haryana.

00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:11.607
We knew that we had to craft
our own journey.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.746
But anyway, we jumped right in
and as we jumped in,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.509
all sorts of ideas started flying at us.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:21.571
People said, "Let's change
the way we recruit teachers,

00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:24.339
let's hire new principals and train them

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:26.581
and send them on international
learning tours,

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:29.104
let's put technology inside classrooms."

00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:31.734
By the end of week one,
we had 50 ideas on the table,

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:33.986
all amazing, all sounded right.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.713
There was no way we were
going to be able to implement 50 things.

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:40.853
So I said, "Hang on, stop.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:44.424
Let's first at least decide
what is it we're trying to achieve."

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.222
So with a lot of push and pull and debate,

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:51.133
Haryana set itself a goal
which said: by 2020,

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:55.144
we want 80 percent of our children
to be at grade-level knowledge.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.473
Now the specifics of the goal
don't matter here,

00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:01.411
but what matters
is how specific the goal is.

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:04.758
Because it really allowed us
to take all those ideas

00:04:04.782 --> 00:04:06.207
which were being thrown at us

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.605
and say which ones
we were going to implement.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.948
Does this idea support this goal?
If yes, let's keep it.

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:16.252
But if it doesn't or we're not sure,
then let's put it aside.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:20.900
As simple as it sounds,
having a very specific goal right up front

00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:24.140
has really allowed us to be
very sharp and focused

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:25.792
in our transformation journey.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:28.434
And looking back over
the last two and a half years,

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:30.420
that has been a huge positive for us.

00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:32.652
So we had the goal,

00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:36.082
and now we needed to figure out
what are the issues, what is broken.

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.728
Before we went into schools,
a lot of people told us

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:41.818
that education quality is poor

00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:45.716
because either the teachers are lazy,
they don't come into schools,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.974
or they're incapable,
they actually don't know how to teach.

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:53.710
Well, when we went inside schools,
we found something completely different.

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:57.317
On most days, most teachers
were actually inside schools.

00:04:57.771 --> 00:04:59.350
And when you spoke with them,

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:03.185
you realized they were perfectly capable
of teaching elementary classes.

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:05.756
But they were not teaching.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:08.101
I went to a school

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:11.209
where the teachers were getting
the construction of a classroom

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:13.311
and a toilet supervised.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:15.287
I went to another school

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.202
where two of the teachers
had gone to a nearby bank branch

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:20.968
to deposit scholarship money
into kids' accounts.

00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:25.743
At lunchtime, most teachers
were spending all of their time

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:29.868
getting the midday meal cooking,
supervised and served to the students.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:32.111
So we asked the teachers,

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.883
"What's going on,
why are you not teaching?"

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.383
And they said, "This is
what's expected of us.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.811
When a supervisor comes to visit us,

00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:43.224
these are exactly the things
that he checks.

00:05:43.248 --> 00:05:45.928
Has the toilet been made,
has the meal been served.

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:49.062
When my principal
goes to a meeting at headquarters,

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:51.473
these are exactly the things
which are discussed."

00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:56.505
You see, what had happened was,
over the last two decades,

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.359
India had been fighting the challenge
of access, having enough schools,

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:03.154
and enrollment, bringing children
into the schools.

00:06:03.178 --> 00:06:06.608
So the government
launched a whole host of programs

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.491
to address these challenges,

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:13.272
and the teachers became
the implicit executors of these programs.

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.444
Not explicitly, but implicitly.

00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:21.668
And now, what was actually needed
was not to actually train teachers further

00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:23.591
or to monitor their attendance

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:27.486
but to tell them
that what is most important

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.110
is for them to go back
inside classrooms and teach.

00:06:30.134 --> 00:06:33.988
They needed to be monitored
and measured and awarded

00:06:34.012 --> 00:06:35.360
on the quality of teaching

00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:37.227
and not on all sorts of other things.

00:06:38.018 --> 00:06:40.478
So as we went through
the education system,

00:06:40.502 --> 00:06:45.762
as we delved into it deeper,
we found a few such core root causes

00:06:45.786 --> 00:06:49.918
which were determining, which were
shaping how people behaved in the system.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.625
And we realized that unless we change
those specific things,

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.602
we could do a number of other things.

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:58.469
We could train, we could put
technology into schools,

00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:00.473
but the system wouldn't change.

00:07:00.497 --> 00:07:03.554
And addressing these non-obvious
core issues

00:07:03.578 --> 00:07:05.387
became a key part of the program.

00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:09.630
So, we had the goal and we had the issues,

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:12.403
and now we needed to figure out
what the solutions were.

00:07:12.888 --> 00:07:15.326
We obviously did not want
to recreate the wheel,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.100
so we said, "Let's look around
and see what we can find."

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.387
And we found these beautiful,
small pilot experiments

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:25.582
all over the country
and all over the world.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:30.114
Small things being done by NGOs,
being done by foundations.

00:07:30.138 --> 00:07:34.095
But what was also interesting
was that none of them actually scaled.

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:37.657
All of them were limited
to 50, 100 or 500 schools.

00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.721
And here, we were looking
for a solution for 15,000 schools.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.884
So we looked into why,

00:07:42.908 --> 00:07:46.023
if these things actually work,
why don't they actually scale?

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:49.807
What happens is that
when a typical NGO comes in,

00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:52.244
they not only bring in their expertise

00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:54.783
but they also bring in
additional resources.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.564
So they might bring in money,

00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:57.909
they might bring in people,

00:07:57.933 --> 00:07:59.627
they might bring in technology.

00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:04.040
And in the 50 or 100 schools
that they actually operate in,

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:06.924
those additional resources
actually create a difference.

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:10.008
But now imagine that the head of this NGO

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:12.787
goes to the head
of the School Education Department

00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:16.076
and says, "Hey, now let's do this
for 15,000 schools."

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.553
Where is that guy or girl
going to find the money

00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:22.281
to actually scale this up
to 15,000 schools?

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:24.067
He doesn't have the additional money,

00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:25.688
he doesn't have the resources.

00:08:25.712 --> 00:08:28.063
And hence, innovations don't scale.

00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:32.341
So right at the beginning
of the project, what we said was,

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:35.011
"Whatever we have to do
has to be scalable,

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:38.322
it has to work in all 15,000 schools."

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:42.138
And hence, it has to work
within the existing budgets

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:44.693
and resources that the state actually has.

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:47.427
Much easier said than done.

00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.840
(Laughter)

00:08:48.864 --> 00:08:51.020
I think this was definitely
the point in time

00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:52.888
when my team hated me.

00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:58.090
We spent a lot of long hours
in office, in cafés,

00:08:58.114 --> 00:08:59.409
sometimes even in bars,

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:01.096
scratching out heads and saying,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.386
"Where are the solutions,
how are we going to solve this problem?"

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.190
In the end, I think we did
find solutions to many of the issues.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.087
I'll give you an example.

00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.053
In the context of effective learning,

00:09:12.077 --> 00:09:15.362
one of the things people talk about
is hands-on learning.

00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:17.654
Children shouldn't memorize
things from books,

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:19.267
they should do activities,

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:21.290
and that's a more effective way to learn.

00:09:21.314 --> 00:09:23.612
Which basically means
giving students things

00:09:23.636 --> 00:09:27.058
like beads, learning rods, abacuses.

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:29.536
But we did not have
the budgets to give that

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.175
to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:33.902
We needed another solution.

00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:35.992
We couldn't think of anything.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:39.197
One day, one of our team members
went to a school

00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:43.587
and saw a teacher pick up sticks
and stones from the garden outside

00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:45.432
and take them into the classroom

00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:46.968
and give them to the students.

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:50.633
That was a huge eureka moment for us.

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:54.500
So what happens now
in the textbooks in Haryana

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:57.266
is that after every concept,
we have a little box

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.678
which are instructions
for the teachers which say,

00:09:59.702 --> 00:10:03.858
"To teach this concept,
here's an activity that you can do.

00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:06.969
And by the way, in order
to actually do this activity,

00:10:06.993 --> 00:10:10.172
here are things that you can use
from your immediate environment,

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:13.217
whether it be the garden outside
or the classroom inside,

00:10:13.241 --> 00:10:15.686
which can be used
as learning aids for kids."

00:10:16.194 --> 00:10:18.640
And we see teachers all over Haryana

00:10:18.664 --> 00:10:21.914
using lots of innovative things
to be able to teach students.

00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:26.202
So in this way, whatever we designed,

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.304
we were actually able to implement it

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:31.132
across all 15,000 schools from day one.

00:10:32.304 --> 00:10:34.490
Now, this brings me to my last point.

00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:37.787
How do you implement something
across 15,000 schools

00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:39.568
and 100,000 teachers?

00:10:40.357 --> 00:10:42.379
The department used to have a process

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:43.677
which is very interesting.

00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:46.402
I like to call it "The Chain of Hope."

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.600
They would write a letter
from the headquarters

00:10:50.624 --> 00:10:52.249
and send it to the next level,

00:10:52.273 --> 00:10:53.756
which was the district offices.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.843
They would hope that in each
of these district offices,

00:10:56.867 --> 00:11:00.842
an officer would get the letter,
would open it, read it

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:02.960
and then forward it to the next level,

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:04.991
which was the block offices.

00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:08.780
And then you would hope
that at the block office,

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.287
somebody else got the letter,

00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:14.330
opened it, read it and forwarded it
eventually to the 15,000 principals.

00:11:14.354 --> 00:11:17.013
And then one would hope
that the principals

00:11:17.037 --> 00:11:19.684
got the letter, received it,
understood it

00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:21.638
and started implementing it.

00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:23.309
It was a little bit ridiculous.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.145
Now, we knew technology was the answer,

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:29.310
but we also knew
that most of these schools

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:31.411
don't have a computer or email.

00:11:32.497 --> 00:11:35.580
However, what the teachers do have
are smartphones.

00:11:35.604 --> 00:11:40.283
They're constantly on SMS,
on Facebook and on WhatsApp.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.895
So what now happens in Haryana is,

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:47.539
all principals and teachers are divided
into hundreds of WhatsApp groups

00:11:47.563 --> 00:11:50.385
and anytime something needs
to be communicated,

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.830
it's just posted across
all WhatsApp groups.

00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:55.687
It spreads like wildfire.

00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:58.704
You can immediately check
who has received it,

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:00.018
who has read it.

00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:03.902
Teachers can ask clarification
questions instantaneously.

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:05.167
And what's interesting is,

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:08.549
it's not just the headquarters
who are answering these questions.

00:12:08.573 --> 00:12:11.462
Another teacher from
a completely different part of the state

00:12:11.486 --> 00:12:13.879
will stand up and answer the question.

00:12:13.903 --> 00:12:16.583
Everybody's acting
as everybody's peer group,

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:18.401
and things are getting implemented.

00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:22.067
So today, when you go
to a school in Haryana,

00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.678
things look different.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:26.132
The teachers are back inside classrooms,

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:27.460
they're teaching.

00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:29.342
Often with innovative techniques.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.842
When a supervisor
comes to visit the classroom,

00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:36.733
he or she not only checks
the construction of the toilet

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:39.100
but also what is the quality of teaching.

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:43.208
Once a quarter,
all students across the state

00:12:43.232 --> 00:12:45.397
are assessed on their learning outcomes

00:12:45.421 --> 00:12:48.279
and schools which are
doing well are rewarded.

00:12:48.303 --> 00:12:50.772
And schools which are not doing so well

00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:53.201
find themselves having
difficult conversations.

00:12:53.568 --> 00:12:55.647
Of course, they also get
additional support

00:12:55.671 --> 00:12:57.607
to be able to do better in the future.

00:12:59.232 --> 00:13:00.856
In the context of education,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.247
it's very difficult
to see results quickly.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.605
When people talk about systemic,
large-scale change,

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:10.208
they talk about periods
of 7 years and 10 years.

00:13:10.232 --> 00:13:11.497
But not in Haryana.

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:16.105
In the last one year, there have been
three independent studies,

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.708
all measuring student learning outcomes,

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:21.039
which indicate that something fundamental,

00:13:21.063 --> 00:13:23.153
something unique is happening in Haryana.

00:13:23.622 --> 00:13:26.630
Learning levels of children
have stopped declining,

00:13:26.654 --> 00:13:28.457
and they have started going up.

00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:31.691
Haryana is one of the few
states in the country

00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:33.294
which is showing an improvement,

00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:37.021
and certainly the one that is showing
the fastest rate of improvement.

00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:39.373
These are still early signs,

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:40.591
there's a long way to go,

00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:43.106
but this gives us a lot of hope
for the future.

00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:46.422
I recently went to a school,

00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:48.389
and as I was leaving,

00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:49.564
I ran into a lady,

00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:50.739
her name was Parvati,

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:52.201
she was the mother of a child,

00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:53.496
and she was smiling.

00:13:53.828 --> 00:13:56.737
And I said, "Why are you smiling,
what's going on?"

00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:59.507
And she said, "I don't know
what's going on,

00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.618
but what I do know
is that my children are learning,

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.093
they're having fun,

00:14:04.117 --> 00:14:07.312
and for the time being, I'll stop
my search for a private school

00:14:07.336 --> 00:14:08.499
to send them to."

00:14:09.523 --> 00:14:11.523
So I go back to where I started:

00:14:11.547 --> 00:14:13.421
Can government systems transform?

00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:15.663
I certainly believe so.

00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:17.781
I think if you give them the right levers,

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:19.288
they can move mountains.

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:20.886
Thank you.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:27.025
(Applause)
