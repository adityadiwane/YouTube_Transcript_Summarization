00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.056
I'm a textile artist

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.056
most widely known for starting
the yarn bombing movement.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.016
Yarn bombing is when you take
knitted or crocheted material

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.376
out into the urban environment,
graffiti-style --

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.616
or, more specifically,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.936
without permission and unsanctioned.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.816
But when I started this over 10 years ago,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.376
I didn't have a word for it,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.536
I didn't have any
ambitious notions about it,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.096
I had no visions of grandeur.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.496
All I wanted to see was something
warm and fuzzy and human-like

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.960
on the cold, steel, gray facade
that I looked at everyday.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.759
So I wrapped the door handle.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.160
I call this the Alpha Piece.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.440
Little did I know that this tiny piece
would change the course of my life.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.976
So clearly the reaction was interesting.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.524
It intrigued me and I thought,
"What else could I do?"

00:00:56.548 --> 00:01:00.736
Could I do something in the public domain
that would get the same reaction?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.320
So I wrapped the stop sign
pole near my house.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.296
The reaction was wild.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.376
People would park their cars

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.776
and get out of their cars and stare at it,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.736
and scratch their heads and stare at it,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.256
and take pictures of it
and take pictures next to it,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.256
and all of that was really exciting to me

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.296
and I wanted to do every stop sign pole
in the neighborhood.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920
And the more that I did,
the stronger the reaction.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.296
So at this point I'm smitten.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.576
I'm hooked.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.856
This was all seductive.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.616
I found my new passion

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.760
and the urban environment
was my playground.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.360
So this is some of my early work.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.056
I was very curious about this idea
of enhancing the ordinary,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.816
the mundane, even the ugly,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.496
and not taking away its identity
or its functionality

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.896
but just giving it a well-tailored
suit out of knitting.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.656
And this was fun for me.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.936
It was really fun
to take inanimate objects

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.640
and have them come to life.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.856
So ...

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.736
I think we all see the humor in this,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.976
but --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.096
(Laughter)

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.816
I was at a point where
I wanted to take it seriously.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.096
I wanted to analyze it.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.856
I wanted to know why I was letting
this take over my life,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.336
why I was passionate about it,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.896
why were other people
reacting so strongly to it.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.200
And I realized something.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.696
We all live in this
fast-paced, digital world,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.280
but we still crave and desire
something that's relatable.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.416
I think we've all become desensitized

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.016
by our overdeveloped
cities that we live in,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.816
and billboards and advertisements,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.456
and giant parking lots,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.336
and we don't even complain
about that stuff anymore.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.616
So when you stumble upon

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.976
a stop sign pole
that's wrapped in knitting

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.696
and it seems so out of place

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.576
and then gradually -- weirdly --

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.416
you find a connection to it,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.656
that is the moment.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.896
That is the moment I love

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.360
and that is the moment
I love to share with others.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.416
So at this point, my curiosity grew.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.216
It went from the fire hydrants
and the stop sign poles

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.193
to what else can I do with this material.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:58.216
Can I do something big
and large-scale and insurmountable?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.720
So that's when the bus happened.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.256
This was a real game changer for me.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.096
I'll always have a soft spot
in my heart for this one.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.296
At this point, people
were recognizing my work

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.816
but there wasn't much out there

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.216
that was wrapped in knitting
that was large-scale,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.496
and this definitely was the first
city bus to be wrapped in knitting.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.256
So at this point, I'm experiencing,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.336
or I'm witnessing something interesting.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.776
I may have started yarn bombing
but I certainly don't own it anymore.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.336
It had reached global status.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.551
People from all over the world
were doing this.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.766
And I know this because I would travel
to certain parts of the world

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.956
that I'd never been to,

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:36.115
and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole
and I knew I didn't wrap it.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.256
So as I pursued
my own goals with my art --

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.200
this is a lot of my recent work --

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.376
so was yarn bombing.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.856
Yarn bombing was also growing.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.216
And that experience showed me
the hidden power of this craft

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.976
and showed me

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.880
that there was this common language
I had with the rest of the world.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.616
It was through this granny hobby --

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.776
this unassuming hobby --

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.696
that I found commonality with people

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.280
that I never thought
I'd have a connection with.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.896
So as I tell my story today,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.376
I'd also like to convey to you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.816
that hidden power can be found
in the most unassuming places,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080
and we all possess skills
that are just waiting to be discovered.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.776
If you think about our hands,
these tools that are connected to us,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.176
and what they're capable of doing --

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.856
building houses and furniture,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.456
and painting giant murals --

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.136
and most of the time
we hold a controller or a cell phone.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.736
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.056
But if you think about it,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.296
what would happen
if you put those things down?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.280
What would you make?
What would you create with your own hands?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.336
A lot of people think
that I am a master knitter

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.416
but I actually couldn't knit
a sweater to save my life.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.576
But I did something
interesting with knitting

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.416
that had never been done before.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.896
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.336
in the sense that I wasn't
formally trained to do this --

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.976
I'm a math major actually.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.856
So I didn't think
this was in the cards for me,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.816
but I also know that I didn't
stumble upon this.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.296
And when this happened to me,
I held on tight,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.240
I fought for it and I'm proud to say
that I am a working artist today.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.800
So as we ponder the future,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.471
know that your future
might not be so seamless.

00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:20.496
And one day, you might
be as bored as I was

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.896
and knit a door handle
to change your world forever.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.136
Thank you.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.976
(Applause)
