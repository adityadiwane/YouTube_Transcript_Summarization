00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.470
This year, Germany is celebrating

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.556
the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:19.092
in East Germany.

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:23.858
In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.320
the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.485
the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.154
in the East was unified

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:35.844
with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:39.117
to found today's Germany.

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:42.511
Among many other things, Germany inherited

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:47.104
the archives of the East German secret police,

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:50.420
known as the Stasi.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.960
Only two years after its dissolution,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.602
its documents were opened to the public,

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.677
and historians such as me started

00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:01.105
to study these documents

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:05.797
to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:07.507
functioned.

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:10.303
Perhaps you have watched the movie

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.341
"The Lives of Others."

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:17.082
This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.942
and as we live in an age where words

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:23.229
such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping"

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.979
are on the front pages of newspapers,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.802
I would like to speak about how the Stasi

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.201
really worked.

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.970
At the beginning, let's have a short look

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.928
at the history of the Stasi,

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.219
because it's really important for understanding

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.706
its self-conception.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.418
Its origins are located in Russia.

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:46.736
In 1917, the Russian Communists founded

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:48.930
the Emergency Commission for Combating

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.731
Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,

00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:53.950
shortly Cheka.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.960
It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.203
The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.960
to establish their regime by terrorizing the population

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.435
and executing their enemies.

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:12.244
It evolved later into the well-known KGB.

00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:15.750
The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.822
They called themselves Chekists,

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.680
and even the emblem was very similar,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.661
as you can see here.

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:28.227
In fact, the secret police of Russia

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:31.518
was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.109
When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.497
it immediately expanded there,

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:41.118
and soon it started to train the German Communists

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:44.366
to build up their own secret police.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:47.886
By the way, in this hall where we are now,

00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:53.566
the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:56.950
Five years later, the Stasi was established,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.569
and step by step, the dirty job of oppression

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.111
was handed over to it.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.542
For instance, the central jail

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:05.856
for political prisoners,

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:08.604
which was established by the Russians,

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:10.864
was taken over by the Stasi

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:14.048
and used until the end of Communism.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:15.850
You see it here.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.485
At the beginning, every important step

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:23.040
took place under the attendance of the Russians.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.141
But the Germans are known to be very effective,

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.519
so the Stasi grew very quickly,

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.207
and already in 1953, it had more employees

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:34.905
than the Gestapo had,

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:37.695
the secret police of Nazi Germany.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.133
The number doubled in each decade.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.558
In 1989, more than 90,000 employees

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:45.223
worked for the Stasi.

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:47.597
This meant that one employee

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.810
was responsible for 180 inhabitants,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.809
which was really unique in the world.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.405
At the top of this tremendous apparatus,

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.189
there was one man, Erich Mielke.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.450
He ruled the Ministry of State Security

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.769
for more than 30 years.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.400
He was a scrupulous functionary —

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.122
in his past, he killed two policemen

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:13.130
not far away from here —

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.197
who in fact personalized the Stasi.

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:21.690
But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.600
Foremost, it was its enormous power,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.090
because it united different functions

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.365
in one organization.

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:32.476
First of all, the Stasi

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:35.571
was an intelligence service.

00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:38.050
It used all the imaginable instruments

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.333
for getting information secretly,

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.934
such as informers, or tapping phones,

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:46.802
as you can see it on the picture here.

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:49.806
And it was not only active in East Germany,

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:52.543
but all over the world.

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:56.506
Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.

00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:58.650
It could stop people on the street

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.078
and arrest them in its own prisons.

00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:04.580
Thirdly, the Stasi worked

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.435
as a kind of public prosecutor.

00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:10.565
It had the right to open preliminary investigations

00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:14.262
and to interrogate people officially.

00:05:14.262 --> 00:05:16.353
Last but not least,

00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:20.218
the Stasi had its own armed forces.

00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:22.222
More than 11,000 soldiers were serving

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.732
in its so-called Guards Regiment.

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:30.148
It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:32.875
Due to this concentration of power,

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:37.940
the Stasi was called a state in the state.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.199
But let's look in more and more detail

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.816
at the tools of the Stasi.

00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:44.459
Please keep in mind that at that time

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.284
the web and smartphones were not yet invented.

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.525
Of course, the Stasi used all kinds

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:54.598
of technical instruments to survey people.

00:05:54.598 --> 00:05:56.711
Telephones were wiretapped,

00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.850
including the phone of the
German chancellor in the West,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.802
and often also the apartments.

00:06:03.802 --> 00:06:07.195
Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened

00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:10.541
by these machines.

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:14.239
The Stasi also shadowed
tens of thousands of people

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:17.471
using specially trained agents and secret cameras

00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:21.006
to document every step one took.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.674
In this picture, you can see me

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:27.154
as a young man just in front of this building

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.908
where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:35.304
The Stasi even collected the smell of people.

00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:38.563
It stored samples of it in closed jars

00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:43.022
which were found after the peaceful revolution.

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:47.258
For all these tasks, highly specialized departments

00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:49.626
were responsible.

00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:51.806
The one which was tapping phone calls

00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:53.696
was completely separated

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:56.242
from the one which controlled the letters,

00:06:56.242 --> 00:06:57.540
for good reasons,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.217
because if one agent quit the Stasi,

00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:04.131
his knowledge was very small.

00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:08.119
Contrast that with Snowden, for example.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:11.196
But the vertical specialization was also important

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:13.501
to prevent all kinds of empathy

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:16.496
with the object of observation.

00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:18.800
The agent who shadowed me

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.657
didn't know who I was

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.522
or why I was surveyed.

00:07:22.522 --> 00:07:24.136
In fact, I smuggled forbidden books

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:27.028
from West to East Germany.

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:30.220
But what was even more typical for the Stasi

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.384
was the use of human intelligence,

00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:37.577
people who reported secretly to the Stasi.

00:07:37.577 --> 00:07:39.379
For the Minister of State Security,

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.291
these so-called unofficial employees

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.186
were the most important tools.

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:50.509
From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:53.346
collaborated constantly with the Stasi,

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:58.222
more than one percent of the population.

00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:00.950
And in a way, the minister was right,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.891
because technical instruments

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.463
can only register what people are doing,

00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:09.771
but agents and spies can also report

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:11.474
what people are planning to do

00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:13.834
and what they are thinking.

00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:18.615
Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:21.459
The system of how to get them

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.491
and how to educate them, as it was called,

00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:27.181
was very sophisticated.

00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:30.088
The Stasi had its own university,

00:08:30.088 --> 00:08:31.608
not far away from here,

00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:33.535
where the methods were explored

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:36.204
and taught to the officers.

00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:39.955
This guideline gave a detailed description

00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:42.578
of every step you have to take

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:44.940
if you want to convince human beings

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.920
to betray their fellow citizens.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.264
Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:53.720
to becoming one,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.314
but that's mostly not true,

00:08:56.314 --> 00:09:00.225
because a forced informant is a bad informant.

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:03.312
Only someone who wants to give
you the information you need

00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:05.973
is an effective whistleblower.

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:10.830
The main reasons why people
cooperated with the Stasi

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:16.330
were political conviction and material benefits.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.440
The officers also tried to create a personal bond

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.848
between themselves and the informant,

00:09:22.848 --> 00:09:28.000
and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.392
that it's not so difficult to win someone

00:09:31.392 --> 00:09:34.835
in order to betray others.

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:38.586
Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany

00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:40.421
collaborated with the Stasi,

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:44.166
as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.956
In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:51.330
and he nearly became the first freely
elected Prime Minister of the GDR

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.475
until it came out that he was an informant.

00:09:56.475 --> 00:10:00.404
The net of spies was really broad.

00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:02.110
In nearly every institution,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.355
even in the churches or in West Germany,

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.543
there were many of them.

00:10:07.543 --> 00:10:11.032
I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,

00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:14.461
"If you had sent an informant to me,

00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.091
I would surely have recognized him."

00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.950
His answer was,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.393
"We didn't send anyone.

00:10:20.393 --> 00:10:23.415
We took those who were around you."

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:26.070
And in fact, two of my best friends

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.401
reported about me to the Stasi.

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:32.990
Not only in my case, informers were very close.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.693
For example, Vera Lengsfeld,
another leading dissident,

00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:40.906
in her case it was her husband who spied on her.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:44.259
A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:48.151
This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,

00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.230
where the only apparently trustable person

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.043
was an informer.

00:10:54.043 --> 00:10:57.740
But why did the Stasi collect all this information

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.661
in its archives?

00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:03.720
The main purpose was to control the society.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.303
In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:09.025
gave the order to find out who is who,

00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:12.119
which meant who thinks what.

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:13.870
He didn't want to wait until somebody

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.390
tried to act against the regime.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.280
He wanted to know in advance

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.175
what people were thinking and planning.

00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:23.997
The East Germans knew, of course,

00:11:23.997 --> 00:11:27.167
that they were surrounded by informers,

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:31.140
in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.234
and a state of widespread fear,

00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:37.750
the most important tools to oppress people

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.909
in any dictatorship.

00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:42.512
That's why not many East Germans tried

00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:46.796
to fight against the Communist regime.

00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:51.378
If yes, the Stasi often used a method

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.050
which was really diabolic.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.236
It was called Zersetzung,

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:59.907
and it's described in another guideline.

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:02.707
The word is difficult to translate because it means

00:12:02.707 --> 00:12:06.605
originally "biodegradation."

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:09.959
But actually, it's a quite accurate description.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:13.518
The goal was to destroy secretly

00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:16.408
the self-confidence of people,

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:19.521
for example by damaging their reputation,

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.990
by organizing failures in their work,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.620
and by destroying their personal relationships.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.995
Considering this, East Germany
was a very modern dictatorship.

00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:37.366
The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.

00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:40.457
It preferred to paralyze them,

00:12:40.457 --> 00:12:42.960
and it could do so because

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.310
it had access to so much personal information

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.240
and to so many institutions.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.512
Detaining someone was used only

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:55.042
as a last resort.

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:58.347
For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,

00:12:58.347 --> 00:13:00.864
one in every district.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.538
Here, the Stasi also developed

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:07.980
quite modern methods of detention.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.763
Normally, the interrogation officer

00:13:09.763 --> 00:13:13.226
didn't torture the prisoner.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:15.802
Instead, he used a sophisticated system

00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:17.940
of psychological pressure

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.034
in which strict isolation was central.

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:24.318
Nearly no prisoner resisted

00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:27.547
without giving a testimony.

00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:29.609
If you have the occasion,

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:33.060
do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.649
and attend a guided tour
with a former political prisoner

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.505
who will explain to you how this worked.

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:42.664
One more question needs to be answered:

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:45.106
If the Stasi were so well organized,

00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:49.439
why did the Communist regime collapse?

00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:53.570
First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.831
was uncertain what to do against

00:13:55.831 --> 00:13:58.768
the growing protest of people.

00:13:58.768 --> 00:14:01.119
It was especially confused

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:03.890
because in the mother country of socialism,

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.410
the Soviet Union,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.793
a more liberal policy took place.

00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:11.210
In addition, the regime was dependent

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.602
on the loans from the West.

00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:17.150
Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.227
was given to the Stasi.

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:23.860
Secondly, in the Communist ideology,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.513
there's no place for criticism.

00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:28.820
Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.614
that socialism is a perfect system,

00:14:31.614 --> 00:14:35.865
and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.

00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:38.226
The consequence was

00:14:38.226 --> 00:14:40.722
that despite all the information,

00:14:40.722 --> 00:14:44.886
the regime couldn't analyze its real problems,

00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:47.571
and therefore it couldn't solve them.

00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:50.275
In the end, the Stasi died

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:52.068
because of the structures

00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:55.788
that it was charged with protecting.

00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:57.858
The ending of the Stasi

00:14:57.858 --> 00:14:59.905
was something tragic,

00:14:59.905 --> 00:15:01.964
because these officers

00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:05.032
were kept busy during the peaceful revolution

00:15:05.032 --> 00:15:07.007
with only one thing:

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.660
to destroy the documents

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.351
they had produced during decades.

00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:15.269
Fortunately,

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:18.806
they had been stopped by human rights activists.

00:15:18.806 --> 00:15:21.732
That's why today we can use the files

00:15:21.732 --> 00:15:23.356
to get a better understanding

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:26.136
of how a surveillance state functions.

00:15:26.136 --> 00:15:28.133
Thank you.

00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:32.439
(Applause)

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:42.578
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:15:42.578 --> 00:15:45.302
So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions

00:15:45.302 --> 00:15:48.090
because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.964
"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.

00:15:52.964 --> 00:15:55.595
And you just told us about my neighbor,

00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:58.583
the spies and the informant from East Germany.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.283
So there is a direct link between these two stories

00:16:01.283 --> 00:16:03.161
or there isn't?

00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:05.183
What's your reaction as a
historian when you see this?

00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:06.908
Hubertus Knabe: I think there are

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:08.811
several aspects to mention.

00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:11.877
At first, I think there's a difference

00:16:11.877 --> 00:16:15.965
of why you are collecting this data.

00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:18.283
Are you doing that for protecting your people

00:16:18.283 --> 00:16:19.830
against terrorist attacks,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.600
or are you doing that for oppressing your people?

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.542
So that makes a fundamental difference.

00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:26.891
But on the other hand,

00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:31.210
also in a democracy, these
instruments can be abused,

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.376
and that is something where we really have

00:16:33.376 --> 00:16:34.761
to be aware to stop that,

00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:37.634
and that also the intelligence services

00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:40.755
are respecting the rules we have.

00:16:40.755 --> 00:16:42.255
The third point, probably,

00:16:42.255 --> 00:16:45.543
we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:49.223
because you can be sure that Russia and China

00:16:49.223 --> 00:16:50.755
are doing the same,

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:52.321
but nobody speaks about that

00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.612
because nobody could do that.

00:16:54.612 --> 00:16:59.576
(Applause)

00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:03.451
BG: When the story came out first,

00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:05.646
last July, last year,

00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:08.474
you filed a criminal complaint

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:11.454
with a German tribunal. Why?

00:17:11.454 --> 00:17:14.667
HK: Yeah, I did so because of
the second point I mentioned,

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.564
that I think especially in a democracy,

00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:21.022
the rules are for everybody.

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:23.386
They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed

00:17:23.386 --> 00:17:27.177
that any institution doesn't respect the rules.

00:17:27.177 --> 00:17:29.155
In the criminal code of Germany, it's written

00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:31.010
that it's not allowed to tap somebody

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.398
without the permission of the judge.

00:17:33.398 --> 00:17:37.219
Fortunately, it's written in
the criminal code of Germany,

00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:41.150
so if it's not respected, then I think

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.046
an investigation is necessary,

00:17:43.046 --> 00:17:45.025
and it took a very long time that

00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:47.131
the public prosecutor of Germany started this,

00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:50.702
and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:53.658
and not in the case of all the
other people living in Germany.

00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:56.131
BG: That doesn't surprise me because —

00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:58.254
(Applause) —

00:17:58.254 --> 00:18:01.697
because of the story you told.

00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:04.180
Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.957
and I expected the Germans to react

00:18:05.957 --> 00:18:09.177
much more strongly, immediately.

00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.789
And instead, the reaction really came only

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:13.646
when Chancellor Merkel was revealed

00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:17.201
as being wiretapped. Why so?

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:19.064
HK: I take it as a good sign,

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:23.394
because people feel secure in this democracy.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.608
They aren't afraid that they will be arrested,

00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:28.771
and if you leave this hall after the conference,

00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:31.335
nobody has to be afraid that the secret police

00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:33.773
is standing out and is arresting you.

00:18:33.773 --> 00:18:35.367
So that's a good sign, I think.

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:38.242
People are not really scared, as they could be.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:42.596
But of course, I think, the institutions

00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:45.163
are responsible to stop illegal actions

00:18:45.163 --> 00:18:48.281
in Germany or wherever they happen.

00:18:48.281 --> 00:18:51.474
BG: A personal question,
and this is the last one.

00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:53.740
There has been a debate in Germany about

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.281
granting asylum to Edward Snowden.

00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:58.046
Would you be in favor or against?

00:18:58.046 --> 00:18:59.734
HK: Oh, that's a difficult question,

00:18:59.734 --> 00:19:01.420
but if you ask me,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.075
and if I answer honestly,

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.841
I would give him the asylum,

00:19:04.841 --> 00:19:06.890
because I think it was really brave what he did,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.502
and he destroyed his whole life

00:19:09.502 --> 00:19:11.171
and his family and everything.

00:19:11.171 --> 00:19:14.380
So I think, for these people,
we should do something,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.534
and especially if you see the German history,

00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:21.031
where so many people had to escape

00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:23.347
and they asked for asylum in other countries

00:19:23.347 --> 00:19:24.730
and they didn't get it,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.567
so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.378
(Applause)

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:35.680
BG: Hubertus, thank you very much.
