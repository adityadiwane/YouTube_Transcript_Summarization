00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.960
Economists have been exploring
people's behavior for hundreds of years:

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.456
how we make decisions,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.536
how we act individually and in groups,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.280
how we exchange value.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.216
They've studied the institutions
that facilitate our trade,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.656
like legal systems,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.920
corporations,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.720
marketplaces.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.056
But there is a new,
technological institution

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.096
that will fundamentally change
how we exchange value,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.600
and it's called the blockchain.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.696
Now, that's a pretty bold statement,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.856
but if you take nothing else
away from this talk,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.616
I actually want you to remember

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.576
that while blockchain technology
is relatively new,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.976
it's also a continuation
of a very human story,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.520
and the story is this.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.096
As humans, we find ways

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.936
to lower uncertainty about one another

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.760
so that we can exchange value.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.575
Now, one of the first people
to really explore the idea

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.776
of institutions as a tool in economics

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.256
to lower our uncertainties
about one another

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.176
and be able to do trade

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.840
was the Nobel economist Douglass North.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.816
He passed away at the end of 2015,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.560
but North pioneered what's called
"new institutional economics."

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.296
And what he meant by institutions
were really just formal rules

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.296
like a constitution,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.240
and informal constraints, like bribery.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.176
These institutions are really the grease

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.136
that allow our economic
wheels to function,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.280
and we can see this play out
over the course of human history.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.576
If we think back to when we were
hunter-gatherer economies,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.536
we really just traded
within our village structure.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.976
We had some informal constraints in place,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.536
but we enforced
all of our trade with violence

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440
or social repercussions.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.296
As our societies grew more complex

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.536
and our trade routes grew more distant,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.576
we built up more formal institutions,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.936
institutions like banks for currency,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.656
governments, corporations.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.216
These institutions
helped us manage our trade

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.256
as the uncertainty
and the complexity grew,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.880
and our personal control was much lower.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.840
Eventually with the internet,
we put these same institutions online.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.976
We built platform marketplaces
like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.536
just faster institutions
that act as middlemen

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.480
to facilitate human economic activity.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.976
As Douglass North saw it,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.656
institutions are a tool
to lower uncertainty

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.000
so that we can connect and exchange
all kinds of value in society.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.176
And I believe we are now entering

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.176
a further and radical evolution

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.656
of how we interact and trade,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.256
because for the first time,
we can lower uncertainty

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.856
not just with political
and economic institutions,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.616
like our banks, our corporations,
our governments,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.000
but we can do it with technology alone.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.936
So what is the blockchain?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.016
Blockchain technology
is a decentralized database

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.576
that stores a registry
of assets and transactions

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.400
across a peer-to-peer network.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.296
It's basically a public registry

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160
of who owns what and who transacts what.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.896
The transactions are secured
through cryptography,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.696
and over time, that transaction history
gets locked in blocks of data

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.200
that are then cryptographically
linked together and secured.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.536
This creates an immutable,
unforgeable record

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.376
of all of the transactions
across this network.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.800
This record is replicated
on every computer that uses the network.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.480
It's not an app.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.320
It's not a company.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.880
I think it's closest in description
to something like Wikipedia.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.856
We can see everything on Wikipedia.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.920
It's a composite view that's constantly
changing and being updated.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.536
We can also track those changes
over time on Wikipedia,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.856
and we can create our own wikis,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.720
because at their core,
they're just a data infrastructure.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.096
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform
that stores words and images

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.600
and the changes to that data over time.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.976
On the blockchain,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.936
you can think of it
as an open infrastructure

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.640
that stores many kinds of assets.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.496
It stores the history of custodianship,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.736
ownership and location

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.416
for assets like
the digital currency Bitcoin,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.016
other digital assets

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.360
like a title of ownership of IP.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.616
It could be a certificate, a contract,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.896
real world objects,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.720
even personal identifiable information.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.936
There are of course other
technical details to the blockchain,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.976
but at its core, that's how it works.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.336
It's this public registry
that stores transactions in a network

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.560
and is replicated so that it's very secure
and hard to tamper with.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.256
Which brings me to my point

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.336
of how blockchains lower uncertainty

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.496
and how they therefore promise
to transform our economic systems

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.720
in radical ways.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.216
So uncertainty is kind of a big term

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.616
in economics,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.696
but I want to go through three forms of it

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.096
that we face in almost all
of our everyday transactions,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.216
where blockchains can play a role.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.616
We face uncertainties
like not knowing who we're dealing with,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.456
not having visibility into a transaction

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.400
and not having recourse
if things go wrong.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.880
So let's take the first example,
not knowing who we're dealing with.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.080
Say I want to buy
a used smartphone on eBay.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.080
The first thing I'm going to do
is look up who I'm buying from.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.336
Are they a power user?

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.480
Do they have great reviews and ratings,
or do they have no profile at all?

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.736
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.376
these are the attestations
about our identities

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.016
that we cobble together today

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.480
and use to lower uncertainty
about who we're dealing with.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.856
But the problem is
they're very fragmented.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.200
Think about how many profiles you have.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.016
Blockchains allow for us
to create an open, global platform

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.416
on which to store any attestation
about any individual

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.840
from any source.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.776
This allows us to create a user-controlled

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.160
portable identity.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.696
More than a profile,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.016
it means you can selectively reveal

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.976
the different attributes about you

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.296
that help facilitate trade or interaction,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.176
for instance that a government
issued you an ID,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.456
or that you're over 21,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.096
by revealing the cryptographic proof

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.000
that these details exist
and are signed off on.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.016
Having this kind of portable identity

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.056
around the physical world
and the digital world

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.376
means we can do all kinds of human trade

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.800
in a totally new way.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.496
So I've talked about how blockchains
could lower uncertainty

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.056
in who we're dealing with.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.656
The second uncertainty that we often face

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.880
is just not having transparency
into our interactions.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.336
Say you're going to send me
that smartphone by mail.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.056
I want some degree of transparency.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.376
I want to know that the product I bought
is the same one that arrives in the mail

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.776
and that there's some record
for how it got to me.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.416
This is true not just
for electronics like smartphones,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.616
but for many kinds of goods and data,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.280
things like medicine, luxury goods,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.520
any kind of data or product
that we don't want tampered with.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.096
The problem in many companies,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.456
especially those that produce
something complicated like a smartphone,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.976
is they're managing
all of these different vendors

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.880
across a horizontal supply chain.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.816
All of these people
that go into making a product,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.496
they don't have the same database.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.536
They don't use the same infrastructure,

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.680
and so it becomes really hard to see
transparently a product evolve over time.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.775
Using the blockchain, we can create

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:49.559
a shared reality
across nontrusting entities.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.856
By this I mean

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.256
all of these nodes in the network
do not need to know each other

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.696
or trust each other,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.856
because they each have the ability

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.960
to monitor and validate
the chain for themselves.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.776
Think back to Wikipedia.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.976
It's a shared database,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.816
and even though it has multiple readers

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.936
and multiple writers at the same time,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.680
it has one single truth.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.816
So we can create that using blockchains.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.816
We can create a decentralized database
that has the same efficiency of a monopoly

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.520
without actually creating
that central authority.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.616
So all of these vendors,
all sorts of companies,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.600
can interact using the same database
without trusting one another.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.736
It means for consumers,
we can have a lot more transparency.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.896
As a real-world object travels along,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.096
we can see its digital certificate
or token move on the blockchain,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.840
adding value as it goes.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.200
This is a whole new world
in terms of our visibility.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.320
So I've talked about how blockchains
can lower our uncertainties about identity

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.456
and how they change
what we mean about transparency

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.240
in long distances and complex trades,
like in a supply chain.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.616
The last uncertainty that we often face

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.280
is one of the most open-ended,
and it's reneging.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.416
What if you don't send me the smartphone?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.000
Can I get my money back?

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.496
Blockchains allow us to write code,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.216
binding contracts,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.896
between individuals

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.576
and then guarantee
that those contracts will bear out

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.560
without a third party enforcer.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.616
So if we look at the smartphone example,
you could think about escrow.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.736
You are financing that phone,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.296
but you don't need to release the funds

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.136
until you can verify
that all the conditions have been met.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.360
You got the phone.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.656
I think this is one
of the most exciting ways

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.120
that blockchains lower our uncertainties,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.416
because it means to some degree

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.040
we can collapse institutions
and their enforcement.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.416
It means a lot of human economic activity

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.456
can get collateralized and automated,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.536
and push a lot of human
intervention to the edges,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.520
the places where information moves
from the real world to the blockchain.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.336
I think what would probably
floor Douglass North

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.736
about this use of technology

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.776
is the fact that the very thing
that makes it work,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.336
the very thing that keeps the blockchain
secure and verified,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.320
is our mutual distrust.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.696
So rather than all of our uncertainties

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.336
slowing us down

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.856
and requiring institutions

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.960
like banks, our governments,
our corporations,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.736
we can actually harness
all of that collective uncertainty

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.360
and use it to collaborate and exchange
more and faster and more open.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.856
Now, I don't want you
to get the impression

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.256
that the blockchain
is the solution to everything,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.200
even though the media has said
that it's going to end world poverty,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.576
it's also going to solve
the counterfeit drug problem

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.800
and potentially save the rainforest.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.296
The truth is, this technology
is in its infancy,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.536
and we're going to need to see
a lot of experiments take place

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.976
and probably fail

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.536
before we truly understand
all of the use cases

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.760
for our economy.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.416
But there are tons of people
working on this,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.136
from financial institutions

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.320
to technology companies,
start-ups and universities.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.056
And one of the reasons is
that it's not just an economic evolution.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.800
It's also an innovation
in computer science.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.816
Blockchains give us
the technological capability

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.416
of creating a record of human exchange,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.000
of exchange of currency,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.416
of all kinds of digital
and physical assets,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.016
even of our own personal attributes,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.360
in a totally new way.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.056
So in some ways,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.056
they become a technological institution

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.856
that has a lot of the benefits

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.080
of the traditional institutions
we're used to using in society,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.120
but it does this in a decentralized way.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.896
It does this by converting
a lot of our uncertainties

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.120
into certainties.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.896
So I think we need to start
preparing ourselves,

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.456
because we are about to face a world

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.616
where distributed, autonomous institutions

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.640
have quite a significant role.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.816
Thank you.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.200
(Applause)

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.067
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.576
I think I understood that it's coming,

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.496
it offers a lot of potential,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.696
and it's complex.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.800
What is your estimate
for the rate of adoption?

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.736
Bettina Warburg: I think
that's a really good question.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.176
My lab is pretty much focused

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.656
on going the enterprise
and government route first,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.216
because in reality,
blockchain is a complex technology.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.016
How many of you actually understand
how the internet works?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.696
But you use it every day,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.496
so I think we're sort of facing
the same John Sculley idea

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.176
of technology should either be
invisible or beautiful,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.056
and blockchain is kind of
neither of those things right now,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.056
so it's better suited
for either really early adopters

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.296
who kind of get it and can tinker around

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.296
or for finding those best use cases

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.496
like identity or asset tracking
or smart contracts

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.536
that can be used at that level
of an enterprise or government.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.465
BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.

00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:53.696
BW: Thanks.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.120
(Applause)
