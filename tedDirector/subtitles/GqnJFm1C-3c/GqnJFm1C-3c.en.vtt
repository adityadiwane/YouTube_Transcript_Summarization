00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
This talk is about righting writing wrongs.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
The Middle East is huge,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
We need to take our responsibilities seriously,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
but not ourselves.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I grew up at a time when iconic actors

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
used laughter to unite the region,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
just as football can.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
(Laughter)

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
before others can laugh with us.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
a stand-up uprising, if you will.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Working in London as TV maker and writer,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I quickly realized

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
that comedy connects audiences.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
is the stand-up comedy circuit,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and you bomb when you do badly.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
An unfortunate connection for us maybe,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
but it reminds me

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.260
working tirelessly

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to support comedians all around the world,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
specifically comedians

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
with a Middle Eastern background.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
(Applause)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
who, two years after 9/11,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
started a festival to change the way

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And wherever they went,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
they killed.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
for a Western TV network.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Now, the American head of programming

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
wanted new local Arabic comedy.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
"Berfect."

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
(Laughter)

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now, I had friends in the U.S.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
who had started a successful new tribe.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And I had every intention of taking this tribe

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
from being outliers in the Middle East

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and pushing them over the tipping point

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
towards success.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
I had four phases to this plan.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
We would film that and air it,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I excitedly presented this to the big boss,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
So I retreated back to my cave

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and continued to support and produce comedy

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and let my friends use my couch

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
as a regional operations hub.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
The earth rotated, as did our management,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
(Laughter)

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and as if by divine intervention,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
things came together

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
to help this revolution take shape.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Here's how the dots connected.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that aired in the States,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and it was getting great hits on YouTube.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Our new French CEO

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
believed in the power of positive PR ...

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
(Laughter)

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and ideas du bon marche.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
Let's just say "value for money."

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I invited our new CEO,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
his reaction was very simple:

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
"Let's make this happen.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And one more thing: No, don't F it up."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So I quickly went to work

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
with a great team around me.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
I happened to find

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
a funny guy to present it in Arabic,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
who is originally Korean,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
This is all true.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Now, while preparing for the tour,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
as I call them in the Middle East:

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and the third B, bolitics.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Oh course, you might think, what's left

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I'd say, watch any successful well-written,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
family-friendly sitcom in the West

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
for your answers.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Now, were the Axis successful?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
In five countries, in just under a month,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
In fact, they were so successful

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
even before it was released in the Middle East.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Anywhere you go.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
So everywhere we went,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
we auditioned amateurs.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
We filmed that process and aired a documentary.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It really is his name.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And all this TV and Internet exposure

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
has led to a great many

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
recruits to our cause.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
In Dubai this year, we've just had

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and yes, even they can laugh.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Dubai, to me, is like a hand

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
20 years ago,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
no one had heard of it.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Look at it now.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
With an inspirational leader, I think this year,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
the opening of the tallest tower in the world

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
is like adding a finger to that hand,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
that points at all those

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
who spread fallacious stories about us.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
(Laughter)

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
(Applause)

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Now, in three short years, we've come a long way

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
These comics are now going to the New York festival.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and it's exploding.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
(Laughter)

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
So, as for the outsiders looking in,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
For example, when Dean talks,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
then I'm not surprised.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
that represents how the media in the West

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
talks about us as bombers, billionaires

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and belly dancers.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Enough.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
We're not all angry fanatics

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
who want to kill the infidel.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
We have a positive story to tell

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and image to sell.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
we love to laugh like hell.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
(Laughter)

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Here are three questions that I like to use

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
to test the truthiness of our representation

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
in any media story.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
One: Is the Middle East

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
being shown in a current time

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
and correct context?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.260
(Laughter)

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
laugh or smile

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
without showing the whites of their eyes?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
(Laughter)

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Three: Is the Middle Eastern character

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
being played by one?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We've started in our region.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
My challenge to the rest of the world

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
is please, start using

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
go online, drop us a line.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Let's change the narrative together

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and let's start righting writing wrongs.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
to put quill to parchment.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
(Laughter)

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
"And now we go in content

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
to liberty and not to banishment."

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Thank you.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.260
(Applause)
