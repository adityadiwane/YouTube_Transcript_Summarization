00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:14.294
Ten years ago,

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:16.214
I had my first exhibition here.

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:20.654
I had no idea if it would work
or was at all possible,

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:24.091
but with a few small steps
and a very steep learning curve,

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.358
I made my first sculpture,
called "The Lost Correspondent."

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:31.823
Teaming up with a marine biologist
and a local dive center,

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:34.516
I submerged the work
off the coast of Grenada,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.195
in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:40.083
And then this incredible thing happened.

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:41.923
It transformed.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:45.455
One sculpture became two.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.154
Two quickly became 26.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:51.907
And before I knew it,

00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.773
we had the world's first
underwater sculpture park.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.577
In 2009, I moved to Mexico
and started by casting local fisherman.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.790
This grew to a small community,

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:09.886
to almost an entire movement of people
in defense of the sea.

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:13.921
And then finally, to an underwater museum,

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.998
with over 500 living sculptures.

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:20.934
Gardening, it seems,
is not just for greenhouses.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.017
We've since scaled up the designs:

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:30.151
"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas,
rising 16 feet up to the surface

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:31.897
and weighing over 40 tons,

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:35.613
to now currently in Lanzarote,

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.772
where I'm making
an underwater botanical garden,

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:41.102
the first of its kind
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:47.084
Each project, we use materials
and designs that help encourage life;

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:52.905
a long-lasting pH-neutral cement
provides a stable and permanent platform.

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:56.262
It is textured to allow
coral polyps to attach.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.979
We position them down current
from natural reefs

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.445
so that after spawning,
there's areas for them to settle.

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.835
The formations are all configured
so that they aggregate fish

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.516
on a really large scale.

00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:16.479
Even this VW Beetle
has an internal living habitat

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:20.465
to encourage crustaceans
such as lobsters and sea urchins.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.473
So why exhibit my work in the ocean?

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:28.035
Because honestly, it's really not easy.

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.264
When you're in the middle of the sea
under a hundred-foot crane,

00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:34.383
trying to lower eight tons
down to the sea floor,

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:38.336
you start to wonder whether I shouldn't
have taken up watercolor painting instead.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.361
(Laughter)

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:42.098
But in the end, the results
always blow my mind.

00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:46.102
(Music)

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.711
The ocean is the most
incredible exhibition space

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:09.406
an artist could ever wish for.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.783
You have amazing lighting effects
changing by the hour,

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:17.124
explosions of sand covering
the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,

00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:19.052
a unique timeless quality

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.116
and the procession
of inquisitive visitors,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.873
each lending their own
special touch to the site.

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:28.165
(Music)

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:52.439
But over the years,

00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:55.822
I've realized that the greatest
thing about what we do,

00:03:55.846 --> 00:03:58.345
the really humbling thing about the work,

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.582
is that as soon as we
submerge the sculptures,

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.132
they're not ours anymore,

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:03.704
because as soon as we sink them,

00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:05.989
the sculptures, they belong to the sea.

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:10.032
As new reefs form, a new world
literally starts to evolve,

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:12.257
a world that continuously amazes me.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.218
It's a bit of a cliché,
but nothing man-made

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:17.733
can ever match the imagination of nature.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.511
Sponges look like veins across the faces.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:25.303
Staghorn coral morphs the form.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.977
Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:34.731
Tunicates explode from the faces.

00:04:36.597 --> 00:04:40.009
Sea urchins crawl across
the bodies feeding at night.

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.941
Coralline algae applies
a kind of purple paint.

00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:51.284
The deepest red I've ever seen
in my life lives underwater.

00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:56.951
Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.

00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:01.719
Purple sponges breathe water like air.

00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.527
And grey angelfish
glide silently overhead.

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:11.193
And the amazing response
we've had to these works

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:15.370
tells me that we've managed
to plug into something really primal,

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:19.219
because it seems that these images
translate across the world,

00:05:19.243 --> 00:05:23.084
and that's made me focus
on my responsibility as an artist

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:25.242
and about what I'm trying to achieve.

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:29.539
I'm standing here today on this boat
in the middle of the ocean,

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:31.286
and this couldn't be a better place

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.437
to talk about the really,
really important effect of my work.

00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:37.121
Because as we all know,

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:40.191
our reefs are dying,
and our oceans are in trouble.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.430
So here's the thing:

00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:45.217
the most used, searched and shared image

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.121
of all my work thus far is this.

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.406
And I think this is for a reason,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.949
or at least I hope it is.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.700
What I really hope is that people
are beginning to understand

00:05:56.724 --> 00:06:00.392
that when we think of the environment
and the destruction of nature,

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:03.282
that we need to start thinking
about our oceans, too.

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:06.215
Since building these sites,
we've seen some phenomenal

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:07.814
and unexpected results.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.409
Besides creating over 800 square meters
of new habitats and living reef,

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:17.457
visitors to the marine park in Cancun
now divide half their time

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.013
between the museum and the natural reefs,

00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:24.010
providing significant rest
for natural, overstressed areas.

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.726
Visitors to "Ocean Atlas"
in the Bahamas highlighted a leak

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.559
from a nearby oil refinery.

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.576
The subsequent international media
forced the local government

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.449
to pledge 10 million dollars
in coastal cleanups.

00:06:38.154 --> 00:06:40.528
The sculpture park in Grenada
was instrumental

00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:44.819
in the government designating a spot --
a marine-protected area.

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:48.202
Entrance fees to the park
now help fund park rangers

00:06:48.226 --> 00:06:50.812
to manage tourism and fishing quotas.

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.901
The site was actually listed
as a "Wonder of the World"

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:55.164
by National Geographic.

00:06:56.297 --> 00:06:58.877
So why are we all here today in this room?

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:00.902
What do we all have in common?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.195
I think we all share a fear

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:05.353
that we don't protect our oceans enough.

00:07:05.837 --> 00:07:07.484
And one way of thinking about this

00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:10.853
is that we don't regard
our oceans as sacred,

00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:12.115
and we should.

00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:14.135
When we see incredible places --

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:18.097
like the Himalayas
or the La Sagrada Família,

00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:19.782
or the Mona Lisa, even --

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.695
when we see these incredible
places and things,

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:24.764
we understand their importance.

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:26.178
We call them sacred,

00:07:26.202 --> 00:07:29.859
and we do our best
to cherish them, to protect them

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:31.477
and to keep them safe.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.185
But in order to do that,

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:36.539
we are the ones that have
to assign that value;

00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:38.096
otherwise, it will be desecrated

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.744
by someone who doesn't
understand that value.

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:45.384
So I want to finish up tonight
by talking about sacred things.

00:07:45.408 --> 00:07:47.562
When we were naming the site in Cancun,

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:51.904
we named it a museum for a very
important and simple reason:

00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:54.355
museums are places of preservation,

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.173
of conservation and of education.

00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:00.960
They're places where we keep
objects of great value to us,

00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:04.093
where we simply treasure them
for them being themselves.

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:07.753
If someone was to throw
an egg at the Sistine Chapel,

00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:09.307
we'd all go crazy.

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:12.170
If someone wanted
to build a seven-star hotel

00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:14.009
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:16.161
then we would laugh them out of Arizona.

00:08:16.494 --> 00:08:20.903
Yet every day we dredge, pollute
and overfish our oceans.

00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:23.333
And I think it's easier for us to do that,

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:25.453
because when we see the ocean,

00:08:25.477 --> 00:08:27.405
we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:28.999
Because for most people,

00:08:29.023 --> 00:08:30.523
the ocean is like this.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.131
And it's really hard

00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:37.573
to think of something that's just
so plain and so enormous, as fragile.

00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:40.950
It's simply too massive,
too vast, too endless.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.610
And what do you see here?

00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:45.323
I think most people actually
look past to the horizon.

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:47.402
So I think there's a real danger

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:50.313
that we never really see the sea,

00:08:50.337 --> 00:08:51.846
and if we don't really see it,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.269
if it doesn't have its own iconography,

00:08:54.293 --> 00:08:56.305
if we miss its majesty,

00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:59.327
then there's a big danger
that we take it for granted.

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:04.089
Cancun is famous for spring break,

00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:06.372
tequila and foam parties.

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:09.939
And its waters are where frat boys
can ride around on Jet Skis

00:09:09.963 --> 00:09:11.225
and banana boats.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.603
But because of our work there,
there's now a little corner of Cancun

00:09:15.627 --> 00:09:18.309
that is simply precious for being itself.

00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:21.702
And we don't want to stop in Grenada,

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:24.036
in Cancun or the Bahamas.

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:28.387
Just last month, I installed
these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:29.911
in the Thames River,

00:09:31.062 --> 00:09:34.564
in central London, right in front
of the Houses of Parliament,

00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:37.545
putting a stark message
about climate change

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:41.393
in front of the people that have
the power to help change things.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:46.087
Because for me, this is just
the beginning of the mission.

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.617
We want to team up with other inventors,

00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:52.562
creators, philanthropists,
educators, biologists,

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:54.960
to see better futures for our oceans.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:57.532
And we want to see beyond sculpture,

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:58.964
beyond art, even.

00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:02.413
Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:04.159
and you've never seen the ocean.

00:10:04.476 --> 00:10:08.069
And instead of getting taken
to the natural history museum

00:10:08.093 --> 00:10:09.681
or an aquarium,

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:12.227
you get taken out to the ocean,

00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:15.012
to an underwater Noah's Ark,

00:10:15.036 --> 00:10:19.006
which you can access
through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.432
where you can see
all the wildlife of the land

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:23.805
be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.216
Clearly, it would blow your mind.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.251
So let's think big and let's think deep.

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:34.005
Who knows where our imagination
and willpower can lead us?

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:36.977
I hope that by bringing
our art into the ocean,

00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:40.530
that not only do we take advantage
of amazing creativity

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.689
and visual impact of the setting,

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:45.159
but that we are also
giving something back,

00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:48.541
and by encouraging
new environments to thrive,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:53.634
and in some way opening up a new --
or maybe it's a really old way

00:10:53.658 --> 00:10:55.725
of seeing the seas:

00:10:55.749 --> 00:10:59.279
as delicate, precious places,

00:10:59.303 --> 00:11:01.072
worthy of our protection.

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.651
Our oceans are sacred.

00:11:03.675 --> 00:11:05.176
Thank you.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.134
(Applause)
