00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.523
Women represent

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.574
50 percent of middle management

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:20.363
and professional positions,

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:23.491
but the percentages of women
at the top of organizations

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.315
represent not even a third of that number.

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.820
So some people hear that statistic and they ask,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.323
why do we have so few women leaders?

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:35.246
But I look at that statistic

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:38.020
and, if you, like me, believe

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.800
that leadership manifests at every level,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.786
you would see that there's a tremendous,

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:47.767
awesome resource of leaders

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.523
who are leading in middle management,

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:53.639
which raises a different question:

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.889
Why are there so many women

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.880
mired in the middle

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.702
and what has to happen

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:02.245
to take them to the top?

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:04.764
So some of you might be some of those women

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.587
who are in middle management

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.513
and seeking to move up in your organization.

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:14.135
Well, Tonya is a great example
of one of these women.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:15.834
I met her two years ago.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.170
She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.393
and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:26.791
"I've worked really hard to improve my confidence

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:30.154
and my assertiveness and develop a great brand,

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:33.979
I get terrific performance evals from my boss,

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.218
my 360s in the organization let me know

00:01:37.218 --> 00:01:40.515
that my teams love working for me,

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:44.351
I've taken every management course that I can here,

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.916
I am working with a terrific mentor,

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:49.334
and yet I've been passed over

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:52.507
twice for advancement opportunities,

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:54.790
even when my manager knows

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.601
that I'm committed to moving up

00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.236
and even interested in an international assignment.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:03.148
I don't understand why

00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:05.117
I'm being passed over."

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:07.345
So what Tonya doesn't realize

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:10.369
is that there's a missing 33 percent

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.990
of the career success equation for women,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.815
and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.529
that's required to close the gender gap at the top.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.543
In order to move up in organizations,

00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:28.162
you have to be known for your leadership skills,

00:02:28.162 --> 00:02:29.741
and this would apply to any of you,

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:32.290
women or men.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.294
It means that you have to be recognized

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:37.971
for using the greatness in you

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.222
to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:44.901
by engaging the greatness in others.

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.291
Put in other language,

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.309
it means you have to use your skills

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.705
and talents and abilities

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.113
to help the organization achieve

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:56.262
its strategic financial goals

00:02:56.262 --> 00:02:59.907
and do that by working effectively with others

00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:03.901
inside of the organization and outside.

00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:06.196
And although all three of these elements

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:08.232
of leadership are important,

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:10.931
when it comes to moving up in organizations,

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.788
they aren't equally important.

00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:15.533
So pay attention to the green box

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.548
as I move forward.

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:22.340
In seeking and identifying

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.357
employees with high potential,

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:29.006
the potential to go to the top of organizations,

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.400
the skills and competencies

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.380
that relate to that green box

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.753
are rated twice as heavily

00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:40.567
as those in the other two elements of leadership.

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.637
These skills and competencies

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:45.337
can be summarized as business,

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.509
strategic, and financial acumen.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.170
In other words, this skill set has to do

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.483
with understanding where the organization is going,

00:03:55.483 --> 00:03:57.621
what its strategy is,

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:00.140
what financial targets it has in place,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.570
and understanding your role

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.247
in moving the organization forward.

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:08.445
This is that missing 33 percent

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:11.425
of the career success equation for women,

00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.978
not because it's missing in our capabilities

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:15.598
or abilities,

00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:17.724
but because it's missing in the advice

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.378
that we're given.

00:04:19.378 --> 00:04:21.147
Here's what I mean by that.

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:23.338
Five years ago, I was asked to moderate

00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:25.171
a panel of executives,

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.160
and the topic for the evening was

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.538
"What do you look for in 
high-potential employees?"

00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:33.620
So think about the three elements of leadership

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.410
as I summarize for you what they told me.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.907
They said, "We look for people

00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:42.563
who are smart and hard working and committed

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:46.669
and trustworthy and resilient."

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.503
So which element of leadership does that relate to?

00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:52.519
Personal greatness.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.200
They said, "We look for employees

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.529
who are great with our customers,

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.723
who empower their teams,

00:04:59.723 --> 00:05:01.781
who negotiate effectively,

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.324
who are able to manage conflict well,

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.564
and are overall great communicators."

00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:10.874
Which element of leadership does that equate to?

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:13.683
Engaging the greatness in others.

00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:15.889
And then they pretty much stopped.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.120
So I asked,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.170
"Well, what about people

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.534
who understand your business,

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:22.940
where it's going,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.550
and their role in taking it there?

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.866
And what about people who are able

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.375
to scan the external environment,

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.176
identify risks and opportunities,

00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:36.595
make strategy or make strategic recommendations?

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:38.980
And what about people who are able

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.558
to look at the financials of your business,

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:45.202
understand the story that the financials tell,

00:05:45.202 --> 00:05:47.470
and either take appropriate action

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.209
or make appropriate recommendations?"

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:52.155
And to a man, they said,

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:54.347
"That's a given."

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:55.945
So I turned to the audience

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:58.976
of 150 women and I asked,

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:01.878
"How many of you have ever been told

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:04.837
that the door-opener for career advancement

00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:08.616
is your business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:11.040
and that all the other important stuff

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.837
is what differentiates you in the talent pool?"

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:17.965
Three women raised their hand,

00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:20.100
and I've asked this question of women

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.644
all around the globe in the five years since,

00:06:22.644 --> 00:06:27.358
and the percentage is never much different.

00:06:27.358 --> 00:06:29.495
So this is obvious, right?

00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:31.407
But how can it be?

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:33.443
Well, there are primarily three reasons

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:35.466
that there's this missing 33 percent

00:06:35.466 --> 00:06:39.101
in the career success advice given to women?

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.630
When organizations direct women

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.497
toward resources

00:06:43.497 --> 00:06:45.830
that focus on the conventional advice

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.798
that we've been hearing for over 40 years,

00:06:47.798 --> 00:06:51.804
there's a notable absence of advice that relates

00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:54.952
to business, strategic and financial acumen.

00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:57.787
Much of the advice is emphasizing

00:06:57.787 --> 00:06:59.621
personal actions that we need to take,

00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:02.321
like become more assertive, become more confident,

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.030
develop your personal brand,

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.854
things that Tonya's been working on,

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.381
and advice about working with other people,

00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.200
things like learn to self-promote,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.365
get a mentor, enhance your network,

00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:16.997
and virtually nothing said

00:07:16.997 --> 00:07:19.070
about the importance of business, strategic

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.294
and financial acumen.

00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:25.397
This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.

00:07:25.397 --> 00:07:28.111
What it means is that this is advice

00:07:28.111 --> 00:07:31.115
that's absolutely essential for breaking through

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:35.513
from career start to middle management,

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:37.257
but it's not the advice

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.507
that gets women to break through

00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:41.824
from the middle, where we're 50 percent,

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:44.377
to senior and executive positions.

00:07:44.377 --> 00:07:47.437
And this is why conventional advice to women

00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:51.532
in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top

00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:54.434
and won't close it.

00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.279
Now, the second reason

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.967
relates to Tonya's comments

00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:02.418
about having had excellent performance evals,

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:05.069
great feedback from her teams,

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:07.686
and having taken every management training program

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:09.756
she can lay her hands on.

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.708
So you would think that she's getting

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:15.064
messages from her organization

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:17.271
through the talent development systems

00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.745
and performance management systems

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:21.680
that let her know how important it is

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.141
to develop business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:29.746
but here again, that green square is quite small.

00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:31.523
On average,

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:33.829
talent and performance management systems

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.383
in the organizations that I've worked with

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:38.858
focus three to one

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:41.186
on the other two elements of leadership

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.672
compared to the importance of business,

00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:46.203
strategic and financial acumen,

00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:50.748
which is why typical talent and performance systems

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:52.711
haven't closed and won't close

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:55.968
the gender gap at the top.

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:59.840
Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.279
and this is really important to talk about,

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.900
because if organizations,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.754
talent and performance systems

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.571
aren't giving people in general

00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:10.187
information about the importance of

00:09:10.187 --> 00:09:12.527
business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:14.744
how are men getting to the top?

00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:17.263
Well, there are primarily two ways.

00:09:17.263 --> 00:09:19.130
One is because of the positions

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.222
they're guided into,

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:24.193
and the other is because of informal mentoring

00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:25.947
and sponsorship.

00:09:25.947 --> 00:09:27.702
So what's women's experience

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:29.907
as it relates to mentoring?

00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:32.809
Well, this comment from an executive

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:34.586
that I worked with recently

00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:36.611
illustrates that experience.

00:09:36.611 --> 00:09:39.266
He was very proud of the fact that last year,

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:43.250
he had two protégés: a man and a woman.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.927
And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,

00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:49.346
I helped the man learn the business,

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:51.753
and I didn't realize that I was treating them

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:53.227
any differently."

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.645
And he was sincere about that.

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:57.840
So what this illustrates is that

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.230
as managers, whether we're women or men,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.260
we have mindsets about women and men,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.127
about careers in leadership,

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.150
and these unexamined mindsets

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.922
won't close the gender gap at the top.

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:12.670
So how do we take this idea

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.713
of the missing 33 percent

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:16.884
and turn it into action?

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:20.281
Well, for women, the answer is obvious:

00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.554
we have to begin to focus more

00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:24.491
on developing and demonstrating

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:26.190
the skills we have

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.639
that show that we're people who understand

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:30.912
our businesses, where they're headed,

00:10:30.912 --> 00:10:33.330
and our role in taking it there.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.726
That's what enables that breakthrough

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.999
from middle management

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:40.867
to leadership at the top.

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:43.230
But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.931
One young scientist that works in a biotech firm

00:10:46.931 --> 00:10:51.300
used her insight about the missing 33 percent

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.412
to weave financial impact data

00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:56.402
into a project update she did

00:10:56.402 --> 00:10:58.742
and got tremendous positive feedback

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.364
from the managers in the room.

00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:03.614
So we don't want to put 100 percent

00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:07.123
of the responsibility on women's shoulders,

00:11:07.123 --> 00:11:11.443
nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:

00:11:11.443 --> 00:11:13.209
In order for companies to achieve

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:15.886
their strategic financial goals,

00:11:15.886 --> 00:11:17.844
executives understand that they have to have

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.600
everyone pulling in the same direction.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.142
In other words, the term we use in business is,

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:25.801
we have to have strategic alignment.

00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:28.952
And executives know this very well,

00:11:28.952 --> 00:11:31.281
and yet only 37 percent,

00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:33.901
according to a recent Conference Board report,

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.499
believe that they have that

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:38.222
strategic alignment in place.

00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:41.900
So for 63 percent of organizations,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.217
achieving their strategic financial goals

00:11:44.217 --> 00:11:45.973
is questionable.

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:49.156
And if you think about what I've just shared,

00:11:49.156 --> 00:11:52.126
that you have situations where at least 50 percent

00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:53.847
of your middle managers

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.446
haven't received clear messaging

00:11:56.446 --> 00:12:00.230
that they have to become focused on the business,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.768
where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,

00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:04.860
it's not surprising that that percentage

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.240
of executives who are confident about alignment

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.937
is so low,

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.906
which is why there are other people

00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:14.292
who have a role to play in this.

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:17.757
It's important for directors on boards

00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:20.749
to expect from their executives

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:23.268
proportional pools of women when they sit down

00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:25.856
once a year for their succession discussions.

00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:28.961
Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,

00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:30.749
it could be a red flag

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:33.641
that their organization isn't as aligned

00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.149
as it could potentially be.

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:37.645
It's important for CEOs

00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:40.469
to also expect these proportional pools,

00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:41.976
and if they hear comments like,

00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:44.519
"Well, she doesn't have
enough business experience,"

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.050
ask the question,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.174
"What are we going to do about that?"

00:12:48.174 --> 00:12:50.323
It's important for H.R. executives

00:12:50.323 --> 00:12:52.955
to make sure that the missing 33 percent

00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:55.116
is appropriately emphasized,

00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:57.219
and it's important for women and men

00:12:57.219 --> 00:12:59.277
who are in management positions

00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.420
to examine the mindsets we hold

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.687
about women and men, about careers and success,

00:13:03.687 --> 00:13:06.398
to make sure we are creating a level playing field

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:08.322
for everybody.

00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:10.245
So let me close with the latest chapter

00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:12.080
in Tonya's story.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.924
Tonya emailed me two months ago,

00:13:13.924 --> 00:13:16.838
and she said that she had been
interviewed for a new position,

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:18.649
and during the interview, they probed

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:20.178
about her business acumen

00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:23.407
and her strategic insights into the industry,

00:13:23.407 --> 00:13:25.871
and she said that she was so happy to report

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:27.829
that now she has a new position

00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:30.922
reporting directly to the 
chief information officer

00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:33.138
at her company.

00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:35.714
So for some of you, the missing 33 percent

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:38.695
is an idea for you to put into action,

00:13:38.695 --> 00:13:40.956
and I hope that for all of you,

00:13:40.956 --> 00:13:44.108
you will see it as an idea worth spreading

00:13:44.108 --> 00:13:46.581
in order to help organizations be more effective,

00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:49.157
to help women create careers that soar,

00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:52.761
and to help close the gender gap at the top.

00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:54.584
Thank you.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.517
(Applause)
