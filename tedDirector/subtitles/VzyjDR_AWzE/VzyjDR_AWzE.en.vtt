00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.940
An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.636
told the story of Clyde Murphy,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.540
a black man who was a member
of the Class of 1970.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.820
Clyde was a success story.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.196
Clyde spent the next 30 years

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.380
as one of America's
top civil rights lawyers.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.780
He was also a great husband and father.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.636
But despite his success,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.980
personally and professionally,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.180
Clyde's story had a sad ending.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.460
In 2010,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.300
at the age of 62,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.740
Clyde's experience was not unique.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.396
Many of his black classmates from Yale

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.900
also died young.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.260
In fact, the magazine article indicated

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:19.836
that 41 years after graduation from Yale,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.036
the black members of the Class of 1970

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.316
had a death rate
that was three times higher

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.780
than that of the average class member.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.700
It's stunning.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.580
America has recently awakened

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.676
to a steady drumbeat

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.460
of unarmed black men
being shot by the police.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.980
What is even a bigger story

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.476
is that every seven minutes,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.500
a black person dies prematurely
in the United States.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.076
That is over 200 black people

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.236
die every single day

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.060
who would not die if the health
of blacks and whites were equal.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.740
For the last 25 years,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.676
I have been on a mission

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.476
to understand why does race

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.060
matter so profoundly for health.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.356
When I started my career,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.756
many believed that it was simply
about racial differences

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.540
in income and education.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.140
I discovered that while
economic status matters for health,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.916
there is more to the story.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.860
So for example, if we look
at life expectancy at age 25,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.876
at age 25 there's a five-year gap
between blacks and whites.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.836
And the gap by education
for both whites and blacks

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.980
is even larger than the racial gap.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.396
At the same time,
at every level of education,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660
whites live longer than blacks.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.676
So whites who are high school dropouts

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.396
live 3.4 years longer
than their black counterparts,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.316
and the gap is even larger

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.980
among college graduates.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.036
Most surprising of all,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.436
whites who have graduated from high school

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.156
live longer than blacks
with a college degree

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.420
or more education.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.316
So why does race matter
so profoundly for health?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.380
What else is it
beyond education and income

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.460
that might matter?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.460
In the early 1990s,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.500
I was asked to review a new book

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.300
on the health of black America.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.116
I was struck that almost every single one

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.396
of its 25 chapters

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.196
said that racism

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.260
was a factor that was hurting
the health of blacks.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.900
All of these researchers

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.700
were stating that racism was a factor
adversely impacting blacks,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.460
but they provided no evidence.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.540
For me, that was not good enough.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.436
A few months later,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.396
I was speaking at a conference
in Washington, DC,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.596
and I said that one
of the priorities for research

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.340
was to document the ways
in which racism affected health.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.236
A white gentleman stood in the audience

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.580
and said that while he agreed
with me that racism was important,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.540
we could never measure racism.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.700
"We measure self-esteem," I said.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.436
"There's no reason

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
why we can't measure racism
if we put our minds to it."

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.036
And so I put my mind to it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.580
and developed three scales.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.236
The first one captured
major experiences of discrimination,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.516
like being unfairly fired
or being unfairly stopped by the police.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.836
But discrimination also occurs
in more minor and subtle experiences,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.940
and so my second scale,
called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.556
captures nine items

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.916
that captures experiences

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.236
like you're treated
with less courtesy than others,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.836
you receive poorer service
than others in restaurants or stores,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.100
or people act as if they're afraid of you.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.876
This scale captures

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.476
ways in which the dignity and the respect

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.436
of people who society does not value

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.820
is chipped away on a daily basis.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.260
Research has found

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.116
that higher levels of discrimination

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.676
are associated with an elevated risk
of a broad range of diseases

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.956
from blood pressure to abdominal obesity

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.636
to breast cancer to heart disease

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.220
and even premature mortality.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.436
Strikingly, some of the effects
are observed at a very young age.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.580
For example, a study of black teens

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.380
found that those who reported higher
levels of discrimination as teenagers

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.620
had higher levels of stress hormones,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.276
of blood pressure

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.020
and of weight at age 20.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.460
However,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.276
the stress of discrimination

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.236
is only one aspect.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.756
Discrimination and racism

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.076
also matters in other
profound ways for health.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.180
For example, there's
discrimination in medical care.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.196
In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.156
asked me to serve on a committee

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.236
that found, concluded
based on the scientific evidence,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.756
that blacks and other minorities

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.660
receive poorer quality care than whites.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.156
This was true for all kinds
of medical treatment,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.540
from the most simple

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.380
to the most technologically sophisticated.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.636
One explanation for this pattern

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.596
was a phenomenon
that's called "implicit bias"

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.916
or "unconscious discrimination."

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.756
Research for decades
by social psychologists

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.276
indicates that if you hold
a negative stereotype

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.356
about a group in your subconscious mind

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.076
and you meet someone from that group,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.396
you will discriminate against that person.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.076
You will treat them differently.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.716
It's an unconscious process.
It's an automatic process.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.916
It is a subtle process, but it's normal

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.820
and it occurs even among
the most well-intentioned individuals.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.116
But the deeper that I delved

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.300
into the health impact of racism,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.900
the more insidious the effects became.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.420
There is institutional discrimination,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.236
which refers to discrimination

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.260
that exists in the processes
of social institutions.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.556
Residential segregation by race,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.556
which has led to blacks and whites living
in very different neighborhood contexts,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.140
is a classic example
of institutional racism.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.876
One of America's best-kept secrets

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.076
is how residential segregation

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.436
is the secret source

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.180
that creates racial inequality
in the United States.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.556
In America, where you live

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.715
determines your access to opportunities

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:48.036
in education, in employment,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.100
in housing and even
in access to medical care.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.876
One study of the 171 largest
cities in the United States

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.196
concluded that there is not even one city

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.556
where whites live
under equal conditions to blacks,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.516
and that the worst urban contexts
in which whites reside

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.180
is considerably better than the average
context of black communities.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.436
Another study found

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.476
that if you could eliminate statistically

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.156
residential segregation,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.316
you would completely erase
black-white differences in income,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.836
education and unemployment,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.156
and reduce black-white differences
in single motherhood

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.396
by two thirds,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.780
all of that driven by segregation.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.836
I have also learned

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.636
how the negative stereotypes

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.636
and images of blacks in our culture

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.676
literally create and sustain

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.140
both institutional
and individual discrimination.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.420
A group of researchers
have put together a database

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.516
that contains the books,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.556
magazines and articles

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.276
that an average college-educated
American would read over their lifetime.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.116
It allows us to look within this database

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.476
and see how Americans
have seen words paired together

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.996
as they grow up in their society.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.996
So when the word "black"
appears in American culture,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.076
what co-occurs with it?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.516
"Poor,"

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.756
"violent,"

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.116
"religious,"

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.356
"lazy,"

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.596
"cheerful,"

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.356
"dangerous."

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.876
When "white" occurs,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.156
the frequently co-occurring words

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.516
are "wealthy,"

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.796
"progressive,"

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.020
"conventional,"

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.156
"stubborn,"

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.396
"successful,"

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.700
"educated."

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.396
So when a police officer

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.700
overreacts when he sees
an unarmed black male

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.756
and perceives him
to be violent and dangerous,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.340
we are not necessarily dealing
with an inherently bad cop.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.636
We may be simply viewing

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.676
a normal American

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.476
who is reflecting
what he has been exposed to

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.916
as a result of being raised

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.180
in this society.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.220
From my own experience,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.276
I believe that your race

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.300
does not have to be
a determinant of your destiny.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.076
I migrated to the United States

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.180
from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.900
in the late 1970s

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.500
in pursuit of higher education,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.196
and in the last 40 years,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.420
I have done well.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.716
I have had a supportive family,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.020
I have worked hard,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.260
I have done well.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.620
But it took more for me to be successful.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.540
I received a minority fellowship
from the University of Michigan.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.500
Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.156
Without affirmative action,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.860
I would not be here.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.356
But in the last 40 years,

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.140
black America has been
less successful than I have.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.836
In 1978, black households
in the United States

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.980
earned 59 cents for every dollar
of income whites earned.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.116
In 2015,

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.996
black families still earn 59 cents

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.836
for every dollar of income
that white families receive,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.460
and the racial gaps in wealth
are even more stunning.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.700
For every dollar of wealth
that whites have,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.180
black families have six pennies
and Latinos have seven pennies.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.076
The fact is,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.036
racism

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.396
is producing a truly rigged system

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.660
that is systematically disadvantaging
some racial groups in the United States.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.876
To paraphrase Plato,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.180
there is nothing so unfair

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.020
as the equal treatment of unequal people.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.236
And that's why I am committed

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.780
to working to dismantle racism.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.236
I deeply appreciate the fact

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.516
that I am standing on the shoulders

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.876
of those who have sacrificed
even their lives to open the doors

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.186
that I have walked through.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.996
I want to ensure
that those doors remain open

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.660
and that everyone
can walk through those doors.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.476
Robert Kennedy said,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.036
"Each time a man" --
or woman, I would add --

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.156
"stands up for an ideal

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.756
or acts to improve the lot of others

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.356
or strikes out against injustice,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.916
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.036
and those ripples can build a current

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.020
that can sweep down the mightiest walls
of oppression and resistance."

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.916
I am optimistic today

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.516
because all across America,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.780
I have seen ripples of hope.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.436
The Boston Medical Center

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.180
has added lawyers to the medical team

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.036
so that physicians can improve
the health of their patients

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.340
because the lawyers are addressing
the nonmedical needs their patients have.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.116
Loma Linda University
has built a gateway college

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.956
in nearby San Bernardino

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.276
so that in addition
to delivering medical care,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.116
they can provide job skills

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.796
and job training

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.596
to a predominantly minority,
low-income community members

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.580
so that they will have the skills
they need to get a decent job.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.156
In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.876
the Abecedarian Project has figured out

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:08.196
how to ensure that they have lowered
the risks for heart disease

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.276
for blacks in their mid-30s

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.316
by providing high-quality day care

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.036
from birth to age five.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.356
In after-school centers
across the United States,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.036
Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.836
is breaking the cycle of incarceration

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.276
by providing high-quality
academic enrichment and mentoring

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.996
to the children of prisoners

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.660
and children who have
fallen behind in school.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.116
In Huntsville, Alabama,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.556
Oakwood University,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.916
a historically black institution,

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.236
is showing how we can improve
the health of black adults

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.276
by including a health evaluation

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.436
as a part of freshman orientation

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.436
and giving those students
the tools they need

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.116
to make healthy choices

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.516
and providing them annually
a health transcript

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.380
so they can monitor their progress.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.076
And in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.036
Purpose Built Communities has dismantled
the negative effects of segregation

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.716
by transforming a crime-ridden,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.676
drug-infested public housing project

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.396
into an oasis of mixed-income housing,

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.596
of academic performance,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.476
of great community wellness

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.900
and of full employment.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.676
And finally,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.700
there is the Devine solution.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.140
Professor Patricia Devine

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.796
of the University of Wisconsin

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.516
has shown us how we can attack

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.516
our hidden biases head on

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.580
and effectively reduce them.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.276
Each one of us

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.460
can be a ripple of hope.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.516
This work will not always be easy,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.460
but former Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.396
has told us, "We must dissent.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.836
We must dissent from the indifference.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.916
We must dissent from the apathy.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.396
We must dissent from the hatred
and from the mistrust.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.076
We must dissent

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.356
because America can do better,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.196
because America has no choice
but to do better."

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.436
Thank you.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.100
(Applause)
