00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.786
The Earth needs no introduction.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:20.596
It needs no introduction in part 
because the Apollo 17 astronauts,

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:23.324
when they were hurtling 
around the moon in 1972,

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:27.396
took this iconic image.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.875
It galvanized a whole 
generation of human beings

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.553
to realize that we're on 
Spaceship Earth,

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:35.840
fragile and finite as it is,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.643
and that we need 
to take care of it.

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:40.624
But while this picture
is beautiful, it's static,

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:43.177
and the Earth is constantly changing.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:46.676
It's changing on days' time
scales with human activity.

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:49.975
And the satellite imagery we 
have of it today is old.

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:52.470
Typically, years old.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.735
And that's important because
you can't fix what you can't see.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:01.595
What we'd ideally want is images
of the whole planet every day.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.871
So, what's standing in our way?

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.882
What's the problem?

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.908
This is the problem:

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:12.191
Satellites are big, expensive 
and they're slow.

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:14.332
This one weighs three tons.

00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:17.097
It's six meters tall, four meters wide.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.330
It took up the entire fairing
of a rocket just to launch it.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.180
One satellite, one rocket.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.380
It cost 855 million dollars.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.614
Satellites like these have 
done an amazing job

00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.730
at helping us to understand our planet.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.356
But if we want to understand 
it much more regularly,

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:36.402
we need lots of satellites,

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:38.373
and this model isn't scalable.

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:40.476
So me and my friends, 
we started Planet Labs

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:42.562
to make satellites ultra-compact

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.849
and small and highly capable.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:49.860
I'm going to show you what 
our satellite looks like:

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:54.900
This is our satellite.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.863
This is not a scale model,

00:01:56.863 --> 00:01:58.371
this is the real size.

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.757
It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:03.046
it weighs four kilograms,

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:05.583
and we've stuffed the latest 
and greatest electronics

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.840
and sensor systems into 
this little package

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.884
so that even though this is really small,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:14.977
this can take pictures 10 times the
resolution of the big satellite here,

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:19.387
even though it weighs one 
thousandth of the mass.

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:23.140
And we call this satellite 
"Dove" â€” Thank you.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.435
(Applause)

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:27.480
We call this satellite "Dove,"

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.499
and we call it "Dove" because 
satellites are typically named

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.865
after birds, but normally birds of prey:

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:35.702
like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, 
Kill, I don't know,

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:37.417
Kestrel, these sort of things.

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:39.342
But ours have a 
humanitarian mission,

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:41.175
so we wanted to call them Doves.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.109
And we haven't just 
built them, though.

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.450
We've launched them.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.568
And not just one, but many.

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:52.953
It all started in our garage.

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:55.767
Yes, we built our first satellite
prototype in our garage.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.984
Now, this is pretty normal for a
Silicon Valley company that we are,

00:02:58.984 --> 00:03:01.927
but we believe it's the first time 
for a space company.

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:05.395
And that's not the only trick
we learned from Silicon Valley.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:08.587
We rapidly prototype our satellites.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.472
We use "release early, 
release often" on our software.

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:13.389
And we take a different 
risk approach.

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.392
We take them outside and test them.

00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:18.281
We even put satellites in space
just to test the satellites,

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.144
and we've learned to manufacture
our satellites at scale.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:23.210
We've used modern production techniques

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.923
so we can build large numbers of them,

00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:28.120
I think for the first time.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.120
We call it agile aerospace,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.808
and that's what's enabled us to put
so much capability into this little box.

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:41.300
Now, what has bonded 
our team over the years

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.436
is the idea of democratizing
access to satellite information.

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:49.221
In fact, the founders of our 
company, Chris, Robbie and I,

00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:51.526
we met over 15 years ago 
at the United Nations

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:54.511
when they were hosting a conference 
about exactly that question:

00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:56.180
How do you use satellites 
to help humanity?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.932
How do you use satellites to help 
people in developing countries

00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.939
or with climate change?

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.405
And this is what has bonded us.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:06.970
Our entire team is passionate about
using satellites to help humanity.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.747
You could say 
we're space geeks,

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.284
but not only do we care 
about what's up there,

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.376
we care about what's down here, too.

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:15.102
I'm going to show you a video

00:04:15.102 --> 00:04:17.561
from just four weeks ago 
of two of our satellites

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.450
being launched from the
International Space Station.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.240
This is not an animation, 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.490
this is a video taken by the astronaut 
looking out of the window.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.479
It gives you a bit of a sense of 
scale of our two satellites.

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.796
It's like some of the 
smallest satellites ever

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.290
are being launched from 
the biggest satellite ever.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.872
And right at the end, the
solar array glints in the sun.

00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:38.241
It's really cool. Wait for it.

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:41.854
Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:43.864
(Laughter)

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:46.875
So we didn't just launch 
two of them like this,

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:48.601
we launched 28 of them.

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:52.214
It's the largest constellation of
Earth-imaging satellites in human history,

00:04:52.214 --> 00:04:55.463
and it's going to provide a
completely radical new data set

00:04:55.463 --> 00:04:57.467
about our changing planet.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:04:59.695
But that's just the beginning.

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:02.777
You see, we're going to launch
more than 100 of these satellites

00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:05.031
like these over the 
course of the next year.

00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:08.680
It's going to be the largest constellation
of satellites in human history.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.337
And this is what it's going to do:

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:13.896
Acting in a single-orbit plane that 
stays fixed with respect to the sun,

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:15.569
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.864
They're all cameras pointed down,

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:20.833
and they slowly scan across as 
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.957
The Earth rotates every 24 hours,

00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:25.929
so we scan every point on the 
planet every 24 hours.

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.180
It's a line scanner for the planet.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.634
We don't take a picture of 
anywhere on the planet every day,

00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:34.820
we take a picture of every single
place on the planet every day.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.513
Even though we launched these
just a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:37.513 --> 00:05:40.278
we've already got some initial
imagery from the satellites

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:43.694
and I'm going to show it
publicly for the first time right now.

00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:46.504
This is the very first picture
taken by our satellite.

00:05:46.504 --> 00:05:48.500
It happened to be over 
UC-Davis' campus

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.544
in California when we 
turned the camera on.

00:05:50.544 --> 00:05:52.073
But what's even cooler is when

00:05:52.073 --> 00:05:55.200
we compare it to the previous
latest image of that area,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.609
which was taken many months ago.

00:05:57.609 --> 00:06:00.174
And the image on the left 
is from our satellite,

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:02.221
and we see buildings are being built.

00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:06.210
The general point is that we will be able
to track urban growth as it happens

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.052
around the whole world
in all cities, every day.

00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:11.579
Water as well.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.420
Thank you.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.987
(Applause)

00:06:14.987 --> 00:06:17.609
We'll be able to see 
the extent of all water bodies

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:20.820
around the whole world every day
and help water security.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.992
From water security 
to food security.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:25.495
We'll see crops as they 
grow in all the fields

00:06:25.495 --> 00:06:28.520
in every farmer's field around
the planet every day.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.423
and help them to improve crop yield.

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.562
This is a beautiful image that was taken

00:06:33.562 --> 00:06:37.680
just a few hours ago when the 
satellite was flying over Argentina.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.104
The general point is

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:42.517
there are probably hundreds and 
thousands of applications of this data,

00:06:42.517 --> 00:06:44.469
I've mentioned a few, but there's others:

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.193
deforestation, the ice caps melting.

00:06:46.193 --> 00:06:49.480
We can track all of these things,
every tree on the planet every day.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.598
If you took the difference between
today's image and yesterday's image,

00:06:52.598 --> 00:06:56.674
you'd see much of the world news â€”
you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.

00:06:56.674 --> 00:07:00.283
And we have decided, therefore, that the 
best thing that we could do with our data

00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:03.275
is to ensure universal access to it.

00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:05.400
We want to ensure everyone can see it.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.979
Thank you. (Applause)

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.780
We want to empower NGOs and 
companies and scientists and journalists

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.253
to be able to answer the questions
that they have about the planet.

00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:21.413
We want to enable the developer community
to run their apps on our data.

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:25.500
In short, we want to democratize access
to information about our planet.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.311
Which brings me back to this.

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:32.874
You see, this will be an entirely
new global data set.

00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:34.801
And we believe that together,

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:39.384
we can help to take care 
of our Spaceship Earth.

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:42.899
And what I would like to leave
you with is the following question:

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:47.170
If you had access to imagery of the
whole planet every single day,

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.804
what would you do with that data?

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:50.412
What problems would you solve?

00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:52.382
What exploration would you do?

00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:54.474
Well, I invite you to come
and explore with us.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.080
Thank you very much.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:28.180
(Applause)
