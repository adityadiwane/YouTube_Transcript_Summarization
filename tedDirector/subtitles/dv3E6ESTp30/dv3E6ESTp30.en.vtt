00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:18.804
Salaam alaikum.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:20.490
Welcome to Doha.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.892
I am in charge of making this country's food secure.

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:25.943
That is my job for the next two years,

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:28.359
to design an entire master plan,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.892
and then for the next 10 years to implement it --

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.912
of course, with so many other people.

00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:38.559
But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.427
about the story of this country that you're all here in today.

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:45.977
And of course, most of you have had three meals today,

00:00:45.977 --> 00:00:50.510
and probably will continue to have after this event.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.943
So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:59.143
We were about 11,000 people living here.

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:06.159
There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.554
Most of the people who lived here

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:10.026
either lived in coastal villages, fishing,

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:15.976
or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:19.378
None of the glamour that you see today existed.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:24.526
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:27.143
It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.242
Resources weren't there to develop them.

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:32.075
And you can see that life expectancy was also short.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:33.977
Most people died around the age of 50.

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:37.776
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.993
1939, that's when they discovered oil.

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:45.793
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:48.243
until after the Second World War.

00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:50.377
What did it do?

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:53.677
It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:57.409
It also made all those people who roamed around the desert --

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.693
looking for water, looking for food,

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:04.796
trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize.

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:06.760
You might find this strange,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.609
but in my family we have different accents.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.609
My mother has an accent that is so different to my father,

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.643
and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:23.177
There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:26.993
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?"

00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:28.776
Because we lived scattered.

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:33.928
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.

00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:37.739
And when the resources came, be it oil,

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.793
we started building these fancy technologies

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:44.443
and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.

00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:46.827
People started to get to know each other.

00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:50.776
And we realized that there are some differences in accents.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:53.711
So that is the chapter two: the oil era.

00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:55.826
Let's look at today.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.552
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.

00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:01.943
So what's the population today?

00:03:01.943 --> 00:03:04.193
It's 1.7 million people.

00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:06.892
That is in less than 60 years.

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:12.794
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:15.627
Lifespan has increased to 78.

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:20.436
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:23.843
And this is amongst the highest worldwide.

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:26.010
From having no water whatsoever

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.494
to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:35.260
I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.460
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.643
The interesting part is that we continue to grow

00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:51.243
15 percent every year for the past five years without water.

00:03:51.243 --> 00:03:56.193
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.

00:03:56.193 --> 00:04:00.126
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:02.642
This is history being made in this region.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:04.559
Not only cities that we're building,

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:09.712
but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.

00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:12.861
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:19.060
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.029
But of course, with the use of technology.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:27.543
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.

00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:30.394
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.

00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:32.410
The question is how.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.676
How could we survive that?

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.760
We have no water whatsoever.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.059
Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:48.227
Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything.

00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:52.726
It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.726
probably most of you used it coming to Doha.

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:58.627
So that is our lake, if you can see it.

00:04:58.627 --> 00:05:00.476
That is our river.

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:05.818
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:12.444
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:14.712
So what are the risks?

00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:16.262
Do you worry much?

00:05:16.262 --> 00:05:20.178
I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:22.769
you will realize, of course I have to worry.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.278
There is growing demand, growing population.

00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.527
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:32.019
And so that number also demands food.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.227
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:38.083
So a country that has no water

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:41.734
has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:44.066
There's also changing diets.

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:48.132
By elevating to a higher socio-economic level,

00:05:48.132 --> 00:05:50.315
they also change their diet.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.315
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:55.668
On the other hand, there is declining yields

00:05:55.668 --> 00:05:58.366
because of climate change and because of other factors.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:03.534
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.

00:06:03.534 --> 00:06:07.349
This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.699
We only have two days of water reserve.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.983
We import 90 percent of our food,

00:06:12.983 --> 00:06:16.683
and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.

00:06:16.683 --> 00:06:19.132
The limited number of farmers that we have

00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:22.666
have been pushed out of their farming practices

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:28.215
as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:31.466
So we also face risks.

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:38.649
These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.167
The question is, is there a solution?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.349
Is there a sustainable solution?

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.333
Indeed there is.

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:49.366
This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:52.050
that we've been working on over the past two years.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.482
Let's start with the water.

00:06:53.482 --> 00:06:57.251
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.

00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:00.349
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.648
A depletable energy? Fossil fuel?

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:05.043
Or should we use something else?

00:07:05.043 --> 00:07:08.382
Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?

00:07:08.382 --> 00:07:12.516
I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:17.848
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.

00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:23.249
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.858
to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:27.882
And that is a lot of water.

00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:30.150
That water will go then to the farmers,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.387
and the farmers will be able to water their plants,

00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:36.517
and they will be able then to supply society with food.

00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:38.634
But in order to sustain the horizontal line --

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:41.965
because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver --

00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:44.599
we need to also develop the vertical line:

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:49.917
system sustenance, high-level education, research and development,

00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:54.979
industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.

00:07:54.979 --> 00:08:01.112
But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.

00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:03.345
Without it we can't do anything.

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:04.897
So that's what we are planning to do.

00:08:04.897 --> 00:08:08.428
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:10.395
and taking it to implementation.

00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:17.095
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:24.230
Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.325
We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:32.886
as a city, to live in peace.

00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:34.831
Thank you very much.

00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:38.910
(Applause)
