00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.593
This is a work in process,

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:21.152
based on some comments
that were made at TED two years ago

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:24.825
about the need for the storage of vaccine.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.469
(Video): [On this planet

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.008
1.6 billion people

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:30.997
don't have access to electricity

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.156
refrigeration

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.797
or stored fuels

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.595
this is a problem

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:43.935
it impacts:

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.647
the spread of disease

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.479
the storage of food and medicine

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:52.605
and the quality of life.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.695
So here's the plan ...
inexpensive refrigeration

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.983
that doesn't use electricity,
propane, gas, kerosene or consumables

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.651
time for some thermodynamics

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.397
And the story of the Intermittent
Absorption Refrigerator]

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.047
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago,
I had this thermo teacher

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:12.174
who talked about absorption
and refrigeration, one of those things

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:14.726
that stuck in my head, a lot
like the Stirling engine:

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.201
it was cool, but you didn't know
what to do with it.

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:19.775
It was invented in 1858,
by this guy Ferdinand CarrÃ©,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.064
but he couldn't actually build
anything with it

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:23.709
because of the tools at the time.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.973
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley
commercialized this thing

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:29.997
called the IcyBall, in 1928.

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:33.062
It was a really neat idea,
and I'll get to why it didn't work,

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:34.260
but here's how it works.

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:36.860
There's two spheres
and they're separated in distance.

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:39.240
One has a working fluid,
water and ammonia,

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:40.852
and the other is a condenser.

00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.841
You heat up one side, the hot side.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.884
The ammonia evaporates
and it recondenses in the other side.

00:01:45.908 --> 00:01:48.446
You let it cool to room temperature,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.633
and then, as the ammonia reevaporates
and combines with the water

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:53.260
back on the erstwhile hot side,

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.138
it creates a powerful cooling effect.

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:57.994
So it was a great idea
that didn't work at all.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:01:59.212
They blew up.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.771
(Laughter)

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:03.582
Because you're using ammonia,
you get hugely high pressures

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:04.873
if you heated them wrong;

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:06.652
it topped 400 psi.

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:08.816
The ammonia was toxic,
it sprayed everywhere.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.012
But it was kind of an interesting thought.

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.468
So the great thing about 2006,

00:02:13.492 --> 00:02:16.347
there's a lot of really great
computational work you can do.

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.446
So we got the whole thermodynamics
department at Stanford involved --

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.300
a lot of computational fluid dynamics.

00:02:22.324 --> 00:02:26.259
We proved that most of the ammonia
refrigeration tables are wrong.

00:02:26.283 --> 00:02:28.336
We found some nontoxic refrigerants

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.471
that worked at very low vapor pressures.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:32.651
We brought in a team from the UK --

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:35.650
a lot of great refrigeration people,
it turns out, in the UK --

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:37.954
and built a test rig,
and proved that, in fact,

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:41.221
we could make a low-pressure,
nontoxic refrigerator.

00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:42.593
So this is the way it works.

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:44.029
You put it on a cooking fire.

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.163
Most people have
cooking fires in the world,

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.741
whether it's camel dung or wood.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.453
It heats up for about 30 minutes,
cools for an hour.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.249
You put it into a container
and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.

00:02:55.273 --> 00:02:56.495
It looks like this.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.336
This is the fifth prototype,
it's not quite done.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.344
It weighs about eight pounds,
and this is the way it works.

00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:05.950
You put it into a 15-liter vessel,
about three gallons,

00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:08.446
and it'll cool it down
to just above freezing --

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.948
three degrees above freezing --

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:13.012
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:14.223
It's really cheap.

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.323
We think we can build these
in high volumes for about 25 dollars,

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:19.078
in low volumes for about 40 dollars.

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:22.572
And we think we can make refrigeration
something that everybody can have.

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:23.772
Thank you.

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.017
(Applause)
