00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:15.054
My work focuses on the connection of

00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:18.561
both thinking about our community life

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.221
being part of the environment

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:22.509
where architecture grows from the natural

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.981
local conditions and traditions.

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.130
Today I brought two recent projects

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.403
as an example of this.

00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:32.479
Both projects are in emerging countries,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.518
one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:37.277
And also they have in common

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:40.309
that the different analyses from different perspectives

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.892
becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:47.634
The first example started with an invitation

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.657
to design a multistory shopping mall

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:51.962
in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:54.257
And this is the type of building

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:57.082
we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:59.246
of what we had to design.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.321
At first, the first thing I thought was,

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.271
I want to run away.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.332
(Laughter)

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.640
After seeing a few of these buildings --

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.440
there are many in the city --

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.882
we realized that they have three very big points.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.978
First, these buildings, they are almost empty

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:16.759
because they have very large shops

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.730
where people cannot afford to buy things.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.570
Second, they need tons of energy to perform

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.738
because of the skin treatment with glass

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:26.706
that creates heat in the inside,

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.346
and then you need a lot of cooling.

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:30.307
In a city where this shouldn't happen

00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:32.202
because they have really mild weather

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:35.951
that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:39.141
And third is that their image has nothing to do

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.296
with Africa and with Ethiopia.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:46.898
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.718
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:51.846
I was really captivated by the old merkato

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:54.027
that is this open-air structure

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.919
where thousands of people, they go and buy things

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.286
every day from small vendors.

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:00.574
And also it has this idea of the public space

00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:03.816
that uses the outdoors to create activity.

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:07.182
So I thought, this is what I really want to design,

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:08.971
not a shopping mall.

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.251
But the question was how we could do a multistory,

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:15.140
contemporary building with these principles.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.596
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:20.144
that is, in a really growing area of the city,

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:22.628
where most of these buildings that you see in the image,

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:24.230
they were not there.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.902
And it's also between two parallel streets

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:29.269
that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.663
So the first thing we did was to create a connection

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.399
between these two streets,

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.598
putting all the entrances of the building.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:39.383
And this extends with an inclined atrium

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:41.711
that creates an open-air space in the building

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.440
that self-protects itself with its own shape

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.242
from the sun and the rain.

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:47.898
And around this void

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:51.201
we placed this idea of the market with small shops,

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:54.971
that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.242
I also thought, how to close the building?

00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:59.152
And I really wanted to find a solution

00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:02.615
that would respond to the local climate conditions.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.723
And I started thinking about the textile

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:06.604
like a shell made of concrete

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:10.175
with perforations that would let the air in,

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.799
and also the light, but in a filtered way.

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.603
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful 
patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.

00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:20.778
That they have fractal geometry properties

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:22.909
and this helped me to shape the whole facade.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.514
And we are building that

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.655
with these small prefabricated pieces

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:30.093
that are the windows that let the air and the light

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:32.075
in a controlled way inside the building.

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:34.457
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:37.060
that use the light from the inside of the building

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.946
to light up the building at night.

00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:44.068
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:45.224
because they were like,

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.912
"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."

00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:53.721
But then we all realized that this idea of the market

00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:56.495
happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall

00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:59.215
because basically they had more shops to sell.

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:03.289
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.517
not only because of the material compared with the glass,

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:08.205
but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.362
So we created some budget savings

00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:12.259
that we used to implement the project.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.191
And the first implementation was to think

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.431
about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:20.765
in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:24.982
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:27.063
And then under those panels

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:30.799
we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:33.613
that would create this urban oasis.

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:35.403
And these porches on the roof,

00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:40.139
all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.301
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:48.356
The second example is a master plan

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:51.635
of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:55.569
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.834
I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:01.956
but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.

00:05:01.956 --> 00:05:05.064
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina

00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:09.041
that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.490
opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.859
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.879
was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.063
similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona

00:05:25.063 --> 00:05:28.054
and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.

00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:30.839
On top of that, we selected some strategic points

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.040
reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.810
and this modified this initial pattern.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.260
And the last operation was to think about the cell,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.950
the small cell of the project, like the apartment,

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.728
as an essential part of the master plan.

00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:46.901
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:49.200
in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.963
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house

00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:56.826
and then a natural ventilation.

00:05:56.826 --> 00:06:00.412
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:02.552
are perfectly oriented in that direction.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:04.012
And this is the result

00:06:04.012 --> 00:06:07.777
that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.

00:06:07.777 --> 00:06:09.375
It has these blocks with courtyards,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.498
and then on the ground floor

00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:12.634
you have all these connections for the pedestrians.

00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:15.741
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:19.404
a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.

00:06:19.404 --> 00:06:22.950
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.842
The volume has this connecting shape

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:28.144
that shades itself with three different types of apartments

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:31.787
and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.687
And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.417
such as a gym and a kindergarten

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:40.487
and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:43.287
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:46.997
is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:49.281
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,

00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.818
and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,

00:06:52.818 --> 00:06:56.202
jumping from one building to another.

00:06:56.202 --> 00:06:58.561
These two examples,

00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:01.945
they have a common approach in the design process.

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.524
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.670
the cities literally growing.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.411
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:16.552
changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.

00:07:16.552 --> 00:07:19.160
For this reason, I see even more importance

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.190
to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.251
that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment

00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.169
and that aim to connect nature and people.

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.067
Thank you very much.

00:07:34.067 --> 00:07:35.894
(Applause)
