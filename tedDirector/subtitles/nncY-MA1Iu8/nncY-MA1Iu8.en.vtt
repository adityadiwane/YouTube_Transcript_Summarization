00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.658
My big idea is a very, very small idea

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:24.435
that can unlock billions of big ideas

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.825
that are at the moment dormant inside us.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.263
And my little idea
that will do that is sleep.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.236
(Laughter)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.473
(Applause)

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:40.260
This is a room of type A women.

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:45.118
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.386
And I learned the hard way
the value of sleep.

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:54.314
Two-and-a-half years ago,
I fainted from exhaustion.

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.124
I hit my head on my desk.

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.848
I broke my cheekbone,
I got five stitches on my right eye.

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:04.729
And I began the journey
of rediscovering the value of sleep.

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:09.127
And in the course of that, I studied,

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.729
I met with medical doctors, scientists,

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:13.632
and I'm here to tell you

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:19.192
that the way to a more productive,
more inspired, more joyful life

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:20.962
is getting enough sleep.

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:26.848
(Applause)

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.438
And we women are going to lead the way

00:01:29.462 --> 00:01:32.866
in this new revolution,
this new feminist issue.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.144
We are literally going to sleep
our way to the top -- literally --

00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:38.629
(Laughter)

00:01:38.653 --> 00:01:44.004
(Applause)

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:47.339
because unfortunately, for men,

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:50.432
sleep deprivation has become
a virility symbol.

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.661
I was recently having dinner with a guy

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:57.801
who bragged that he had only gotten
four hours sleep the night before.

00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:00.755
And I felt like saying to him --
but I didn't say --

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.906
I felt like saying, "You know what?
if you had gotten five,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.479
this dinner would have been
a lot more interesting."

00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:10.463
(Laughter)

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:13.979
There is now a kind
of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:17.709
Especially here in Washington,
if you try to make a breakfast date,

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.606
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.593
they're likely to tell you,
"Eight o'clock is too late for me,

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:24.682
but that's OK, I can get
a game of tennis in

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:27.217
and do a few conference calls
and meet you at eight."

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:32.064
And they think that means they are
so incredibly busy and productive,

00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:33.735
but the truth is, they're not,

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.236
because we, at the moment,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.121
have had brilliant leaders
in business, in finance, in politics,

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:43.966
making terrible decisions.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:49.487
So a high IQ does not mean
that you're a good leader,

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:53.735
because the essence of leadership
is being able to see the iceberg

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.615
before it hits the Titanic.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.382
(Laughter)

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:01.339
And we've had far too many icebergs
hitting our Titanics.

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:03.903
In fact, I have a feeling

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:07.388
that if Lehman Brothers
was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:08.873
they might still be around.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.325
(Laughter)

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.426
(Applause)

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.011
While all the brothers were busy
just being hyper-connected 24/7,

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:20.372
maybe a sister would have
noticed the iceberg,

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:21.935
because she would have woken up

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.840
from a seven-and-a-half-
or eight-hour sleep,

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.675
and have been able to see the big picture.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:33.075
So as we are facing
all the multiple crises

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.504
in our world at the moment,

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.345
what is good for us on a personal level,

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:43.906
what's going to bring more joy,
gratitude, effectiveness in our lives

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.410
and be the best for our own careers,

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.945
is also what is best for the world.

00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:54.546
So I urge you to shut your eyes,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.007
and discover the great ideas
that lie inside us;

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.950
to shut your engines
and discover the power of sleep.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.236
Thank you.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.720
(Applause)
