00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Sixty-five million years ago, a very important

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
and catastrophic event

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
changed the course of life on land.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
And these animals disappeared,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.330
and a separate life, mammals,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and the things that we've experienced

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
in the entire record of humankind history

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
can't really quite get around the kind of disaster

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
that this represented for the Earth.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.330
So even before that impact was known,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
even before scientists in general came to an agreement

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
over the theory of evolution,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
actually had divided Earth's life's history

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
into these two episodes:

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
with geologic history.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
So we have a Mesozoic period,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
an age of fragmentation,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection --

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
South America to North America, India to Asia.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And so my work, really, is trying to understand

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
the character of that Mesozoic radiation

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
compared to the Cenozoic radiation

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
about what life on drifting continents

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
really can tell us about evolution.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
The work immediately begs the question,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
"Why didn't they go into the waters?"

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
You can go outside -- see many other examples.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.330
we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
and why didn't they burrow?

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
what kinds of animals were in those spaces?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
about, you know, how evolution works on land?

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size --

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
the size you are when you inherit

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
a vacant ecospace

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
from whatever natural disaster.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Looking at dinosaur evolution

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and studying it, digging it up for many years,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
I end up looking at the mammal radiation,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
advancing by an order of magnitude.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
You want to measure it by diversity?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
You want to measure it by

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
the time it took to reach maximum body size?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
Yes, they do have larger body size,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
but many of them are smaller,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
to achieve maximum body size

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
and invade all those habitats.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
So there's lessons to learn,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
and there's lessons to learn from the exception,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
and many other scholars have made around the world.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.330
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
We now know this transition is the one time

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.330
that dinosaurs actually went below

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
that body size --

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
we're going to see where they began in a minute --

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
and it is the one time that they rapidly

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
invaded all the habitats

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
They became marine. We now know them today

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
from the ice caps.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
There's burrowing birds.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
and, of course, they inhabit the land.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.330
that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and if you go to different layers, you find things

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs --

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
or, more appropriately, feathers -- as to decide whether it's actually

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
a non-avian or an avian.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
It is the greatest transition that we have, actually,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
on land from one habitat to another,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
bar none,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
to understand how a bony,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
could make such a transition.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
It is really our greatest -- one of our greatest -- evolutionary sequences.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
Now, my work began at the beginning.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
I'd have to go back to those beds

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
where the earliest dinosaurs existed.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
I'd like to call for this little video clip

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
If we could roll that first video clip.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
through those early beds,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
and they're located in Northeastern Argentina.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
dinosaurs had basically taken over.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.330
You go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
you get a topographic map,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.330
and the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
and find, really, everything that existed --

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
and you dig a place like that,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
228 million years old, we found

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
what really is the most primitive dinosaur:

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
that's the Ur-dinosaur.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
A three-and-a-half foot thing,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
beautiful skull, predator,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
meat-eater, a two-legged animal.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
or your kids know, at least, on four legs.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
This is sort of a look at the skull,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
It looks rather bird-like because it is.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
It's bird-like and hollow.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
or 10 kilograms.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
That is 10 times larger

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
We are extremely dinosaur-like,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
Now, if you want to understand what happened

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
then when the continents broke apart,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are --

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.330
found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
because it was those continents that are least explored.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
you really have to force yourself to go down

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
to the four corners of the Earth --

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia --

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
and start putting together some of these pieces.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
I've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
in the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
if you could survive an expedition.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
To be able to excavate

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
and take them out, you really have to put together

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
an expedition team that can handle the conditions.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Some of them are political. Many of them are physical.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental. 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions --

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
you have to drive into the desert,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
you will see landscapes in many cases --

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.330
you can see from what we've discovered --

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
that nobody else has ever seen.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
And the kinds of teams they bring in?

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Well, they're

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
composed of

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
people who understand science as adventure with a purpose.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
They're usually students who've never seen a desert.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
Some of them are more experienced.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport --

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
your job as a leader is to try to inspire them

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
to do more work than they've ever done in their life

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
under conditions that they can't imagine.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
So, 125 degrees is normal.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
The ground surface at 150 -- typical.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.330
So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
You're really rubbing shoulders

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
with the world's last great nomadic people.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
much as they have for centuries.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
and make them enter the pages of history.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
To do that, you've got to actually transport them

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
thousands of miles out of the desert.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
We're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger --

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
or Niger, in our English language -- north of Nigeria --

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
that's where this photograph was taken.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
Basically you're talking about a country that,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
when we started working there, did not have container traffic.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
You transported the bones out yourself

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
to the coast of Africa,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
That's a 2,000 mile journey.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
So enormous excavations and a lot of work,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material --

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
we erect Jobaria,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
It really is a little bit out of place temporally.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
It looks nothing like what we would find

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
if we dug in contemporary beds in North America.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
And, you know, on and on --

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this --

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and some of you have had the chance to touch it --

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
This is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
It is an incredible view of life,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
and it really began when we began to understand

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
the depth of time.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
It's only been with us for less than a century,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
and in that time, that fourth dimension,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.330
and we could actually tell how old some of these things were,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
is probably the most profound transformation,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
because it changes the way we look at ourselves

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
and the world dramatically.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
When you pick up a piece of history like that,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
I think it can transform

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
kids that are possibly interested in science.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
That's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Here's some others.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
It turns out to have a forebrain

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
one-fifteenth the size of a human.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
This was the cover of Science, because they thought

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
that humans were more intelligent than these animals, 

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
but we can see by some in our administration

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
that despite

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
the enormous advantage in brain volume

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
smaller raptors.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of --

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
all those small animals --

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.330
they all come from northern continents.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
and guess what? You start preparing it.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
It's really a wholly separate radiation.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
So what we're trying to piece together here is a story.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.330
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
that we reconstructed from Africa.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
Crocodiles, of course,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
And huge things -- I mean, this is a

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
lower jaw just laying there in the desert

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
of this enormous crocodile.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
We had to try and reconstruct this.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
to understand how crocodiles scale.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
Could I have the second little video clip?

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
We had to find and measure

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
the largest crocodiles living today.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
Narrator: ... as long as their boat.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Man: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
Narrator: If they can just land it,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
this croc will provide useful data,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
Man: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
Man: I got the back legs.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
I've got it. I've got the back legs.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
Somebody get the front legs.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.330
Wow.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Sixty-five. Wow.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
That's a big skull.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Narrator: Big, but less than half the size

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
of supercroc's skull.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.330
Man: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.330
Man: I knew it was big.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.330
PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.330
to release the animal back into the river.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.330
PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.330
Narrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
One, two, three!

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
Whoa!

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
So -- there were --

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.330
(Applause)

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
Well, you know, the -- the fossil record is truly amazing

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
We proved with those measurements

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
that crocodiles scaled isometrically.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.330
It depended on the shape of their skull, though,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
so we had to actually get those measurements

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Anyway, you find other things, too.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.330
We found this last year.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
This is a ceremonial disk.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
5,000 years ago is been sitting out there

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
It's really an island continent.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
It was a precursor to India,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
a messenger from Gondwana --

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
a lost paradise of dinosaurs 

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
isolated for millions of years.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
No one's found them. We know where they are,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
and we're going to go and get them next year.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
They're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
but if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
so that we can try to understand

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
some basic patterns of evolution.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.330
I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
that we've been compiling

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
We can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
but we can learn some of the rules of the game,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
and that's really what we're trying to do.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
With regard to the biogeographic question,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
the Earth is dividing.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.330
These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
You get divided, and a continent's division

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
or you're crafty, and you manage to escape

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
from one to the other and erase that division,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
or you're living peacefully on each side,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
and on one side you just go extinct,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
and you survive on the other side and create a difference.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
And you take those four instances

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
and you realize you have a complex problem.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.330
And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated --

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
we call it dispersal -- around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.330
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.330
to maintain similarity between continents.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
and we do see the continents

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
carving differences among dinosaurs.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
We have downgraded this factor.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
It carves up the history of life,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
and gives us the differences that we see

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
in the dinosaur world towards the end,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
right before the bolide impact.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
The best way to test this is to actually create a model.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.330
So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.330
I want to give you three dimensions.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
So you see the tree of life,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
but now I've added the dimension of area.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.330
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.330
Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
This is a computer program

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
which has three knobs.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
We can control those things that we're worried about:

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.330
extinction, sampling, dispersal --

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
going from one area to another.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
And ultimately we can control the branching

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
to mimic what we think the continents were like,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.330
and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.330
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.330
talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
which is related to the fact that I never --

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.330
honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
but there are a number of you out there that started your

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.330
scientific, technical, entertainment career

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.330
as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.330
I was one of those. I was failed by my school -- my school failed me.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.330
Who's pointing fingers?

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.330
Several teachers nearly killed me.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
I found myself in art.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.330
I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.330
And I went on -- that's my first painting on canvas.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
I read a dictionary. I got into college.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.330
I became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.330
It became abstract.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.330
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.330
Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.330
I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
But really it's the same discipline -- they're kindred disciplines.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
I mean, is there anything

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
that is not visualizing what can't be seen,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
that's out there, or seeing the distortion

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.330
that we try to see

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
This is a very extraordinarily visual.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
I give you a human face because you're experts at that.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.330
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.330
They're really kindred disciplines.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.330
But what we're trying to create in Chicago

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.330
is a way to get,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.330
collect together, those students

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.330
who are least represented in our science and technology spheres.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.330
We all know, and there's been several allusions to it,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.330
that we are failing in our ability to produce

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.330
enough scientists, engineers and technicians.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.330
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.330
and now, as you see the increase

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.330
in the pace of what we're doing,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.330
it becomes even more prominent. 
Where are all these people going to come from?

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.330
And a more general question for our society is,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.330
what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.330
What about all the kids like me that were in school --

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
kids like some of you out there --

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.330
that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.330
to participate in science and technology?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.330
Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.330
Niger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.330
to do something in Niger.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.330
They have an AIDS problem. I asked --

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.330
the U.S. State Department asked the government recently,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.330
What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
Dinosaurs was one of them.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.330
Give us a museum of dinosaurs,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
and we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.330
And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.330
or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.330
But when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.330
the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city I come from --

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.330
there's legions of kids out there

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.330
like these.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.330
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries --

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.330
as to how we get these kids involved in science.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.330
We've started in Chicago

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.330
an organization -- a non-profit organization --

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.330
called Project Exploration.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.330
These are two kids from Project Exploration.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
We met them in their early stages in high school. They were --

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.330
failing to poor students,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.330
and they are now -- one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.330
We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.330
And we created a track record.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.330
Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.330
track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.330
So, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.330
90 percent going to college, many first-generation,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.330
90 percent of those choosing science as a career.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.330
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.330
well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.330
but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.330
It's gone through science as an inquiry,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.330
which was a big advance,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.330
and Dewey back at Chicago --

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.330
you learn by doing.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:50.330
To -- you learn by envisioning yourself

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.330
as a scientist,

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.330
and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.330
The next step is to learn the capability

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.330
to make yourself a scientist.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.330
You have to have those steps. If you have --

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.330
It's easy to get kids interested in science.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.330
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.330
which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.330
and presenting something as a knowledgeable person,

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.330
and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.330
and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.330
And so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.330
We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing --

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.330
and I've talked to some people here at TED --

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.330
it's not going to look like anything you've seen before.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.330
It's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.330
part-conservatory, part-zoo,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.330
and part of an answer to the problem

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.330
of how you interest kids in science.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.330
Thank you very much.
