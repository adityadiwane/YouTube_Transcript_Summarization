00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
We're 25, 26 years after

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
the advent of the Macintosh,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
which was an astoundingly seminal event

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
in the history

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of human-machine interface

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and in computation in general.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
It fundamentally changed the way

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that people thought about computation,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
thought about computers,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
It was such a radical change, in fact,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that the early Macintosh development team

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
in '82, '83, '84

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Now, this is an interesting little message,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and it's a lesson that has since, I think,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
been forgotten or lost or something,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
The interface is the OS.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So it was a necessity.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But in the quarter-century since then,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
we've seen all of the fundamental

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
supporting technologies go berserk.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So memory capacity and disk capacity

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Same thing for processor speeds.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Networks, we didn't have networks at all

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
at the time of the Macintosh's introduction,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and that has become the single most salient aspect

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
of how we live with computers.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And, of course, graphics: Today

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
buys you more graphics power

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
So we've got that incredible ramp-up.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Then, on the side, we've got the Web

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and, increasingly, the cloud,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
which is fantastic,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
kind of a distraction.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and people are starting to wake up about that.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So what happens next? Where do we go from there?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
The problem, as we see it,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
has to do with a single, simple word: "space,"

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
or a single, simple phrase:

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
"real world geometry."

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Computers and the programming languages

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
that we talk to them in, that we teach them in,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
are hideously insensate when it comes to space.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
They don't understand real world space.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
They also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So what happens if you start to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
explain space to them?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
The Luminous Room is a system

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in which it's considered that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
input and output spaces are co-located.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
That's a strangely simple,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and yet unexplored idea, right?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
The pixels are up on the display.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
pets, potted plants, whatever was in there,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And that means input and output are in the same space

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
enabling stuff like this.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
That's a digital storage in a physical container.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
The contract is the same

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
as with real word objects in real world containers.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Has to come back out, whatever you put in.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
This little design experiment

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If you presented it with a chess board,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And if there was nothing for them to do,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
the chess pieces eventually got bored

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and hopped away.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
The academics who were overseeing this work

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
thought that that was too frivolous,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
so we built deadly serious applications

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
like this optics prototyping workbench

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
becomes a laser.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and the system projects down the laser beam path.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So you've got an interface that has no interface.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
You operate the world as you operate the real world,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
which is to say, with your hands.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
flowing from right to left --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
a real world object in that.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Here, the real world merges with the simulation.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And finally, to pull out all the stops,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
this is a system called Urp, for urban planners,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in which we give architects and urban planners back

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
the models that we confiscated

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
when we insisted that they use CAD systems.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And we make the machine meet them half way.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
It projects down digital shadows, as you see here.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
then you can control the sun's position in the sky.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
That's 8 a.m. shadows.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
There you are, swinging the sun around.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Short shadows at noon and so forth.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And we built up a series of tools like this.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
There are inter-shadowing studies

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that children can operate,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
even though they don't know anything about urban planning:

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
A material wand makes the building

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Now, if these ideas seem familiar

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
or perhaps even a little dated,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
that's great; they should seem familiar.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
This work is 15 years old.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
director of the Tangible Media Group.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
But it was that work that was seen

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
by Alex McDowell,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
one of the world's legendary production designers.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and invited us to come out from MIT

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and design the interfaces

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
that would appear in that film.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And the great thing about it was

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
the idea that the putative 2054

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that we were painting in the film be believable,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that he allowed us to take on that design work

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
as if it were an R&amp;D effort.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
And the result is sort of

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
gratifyingly perpetual.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
when they talk about new UI design.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
So this led full circle, in a strange way,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
to build these ideas into what we believe

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
is the necessary future of human machine interface:

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And, using a hand,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
six degrees of navigational control.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And you can come back out

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
through the scary orangutan.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And that's all well and good.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
Let's do something a little more difficult.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
We can fly around them.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
So navigation is a fundamental issue.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
You have to be able to navigate in 3D.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
is inherently spatial.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
We can organize it this way.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And, of course, it's not just about navigation,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
but about manipulation as well.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So if we don't like stuff,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
or we're intensely curious about

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
we can pull them out like that.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
and ask for a different distribution.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Let's just come down a bit

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and fly around.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
So that's a different way to look at stuff.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
If you're of a more analytical nature

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
then you might want, actually, to look at this

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
as a color histogram.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So now we've got the stuff color-sorted,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
angle maps onto color.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And now, if we want to select stuff,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
3D, space,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
the idea that we're tracking hands in real space

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
becomes really important because we can reach in,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
Here are some selection planes.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And we'll perform this Boolean operation

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
So, from there to the world of real work.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Here's a logistics system,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
a small piece of one that we're currently building.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
There're a lot of elements.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
with three-dimensional and geospatial information.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So here's a familiar place.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
And we'll bring this back here for a second.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Maybe select a little bit of that.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And bring out this graph.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And we should, now,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
be able to fly in here

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
and have a closer look.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
These are logistics elements

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that are scattered across the United States.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
One thing that three-dimensional interactions

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
and the general idea of imbuing

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
computation with space affords you

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
is a final destruction of that unfortunate

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
That's the old way, that's the old mantra:

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
In the real world, we have people who collaborate;

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
we have people who have to work together,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and we have many different displays.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
And we might want to look at these various images.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
We might want to ask for some help.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The author of this new pointing device

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
is sitting over there,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
so I can pull this from there to there.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
These are unrelated machines, right?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
So I'm going to leave that over there

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
because I have a question for Paul.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
So let me get some of these out of the way.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Let's pull this apart:

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
I'll go ahead and explode it.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Kevin, can you help?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but we do it in the lab all the time.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
All right.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
or distant and distinct, is always important.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
And again, that stuff

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
needs to be undertaken in the context of space.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
that takes us back to the world of imagery.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
This is a system called TAMPER,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
which is a slightly whimsical look

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
at what the future of editing

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and media manipulation systems might be.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
We at Oblong believe that media should be

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
accessible in much more fine-grained form.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
So we have a large number of movies

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
stuck inside here.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
And let's just pick out a few elements.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
We can zip through them

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
as a possibility.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
We can grab elements off the front,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
where upon they reanimate, come to life,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
and drag them down onto the table here.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and grab our blue friend

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and put him down on the table as well.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
We may need more than one.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And we probably need,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
well, we probably need a cowboy

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
to be quite honest.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
(Laughter)

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Yeah, let's

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
take that one.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
(Laughter)

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
You see, cowboys and French farce people

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
don't go well together, and the system knows that.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Let me leave with one final thought,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
and that is that

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
one of the greatest English language writers

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
of the last three decades

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
suggested that great art is always a gift.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
to buy the stolen Vermeer;

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
he was talking about the circumstances of its creation

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
and of its existence.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And I think that it's time that we asked

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
for the same from technology.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Technology is capable of

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
expressing and being imbued with

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
a certain generosity,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and we need to demand that, in fact.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
For some of this kind of technology,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
ground center is

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
a combination of design, which is crucially important.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
We can't have advances in technology any longer

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
unless design is integrated from the very start.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and are built in that same image.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So I will leave you with that. Thank you.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:31.260
(Applause)

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question --

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
actually this is from Bill Gates --

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
when? (John Underkoffler: When?)

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
JU: No, it has to be for every human being.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
That's our goal entirely.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
We won't have succeeded

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
unless we take that next big step.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I mean it's been 25 years.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Can there really be only one interface? There can't.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
CA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
you need projectors, cameras?

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
You know, how can it work?

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
It'll be built into architecture.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
So this is the inevitability about it.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
CA: So, in your mind, five years time,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
someone can buy this as part of

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
a standard computer interface?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
JU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
you'll get this.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
CA: Well that's cool.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.260
(Applause)

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
At the moment, our early-adopter customers --

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
and these systems are deployed out in the real world --

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
or natural gas and resource extraction,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And I understand what you're asking.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
CA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
(Laughter)

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
John, thank you for making science-fiction real.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
JU: It's been a great pleasure.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
Thank you to you all.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
(Applause)
