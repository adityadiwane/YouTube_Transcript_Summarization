00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We spoke to you last several years ago.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And before I get started today,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
since many of you are wondering,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I just wanted to get it out of the way.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The answer is boxers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now I hope all of you feel better.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Audience: Yes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
SB: What is it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But this is what helped me see it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Here it's slightly logged.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But here you can see around the world

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
how people are using Google.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And every one of those rising dots

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
represents probably about 20, 30 searches,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or something like that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And they're labeled by color right now, by language.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and they're all coming up red.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You can see that Japan is busy at night,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
right there.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
There's a lot of activity in China.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There's a lot of activity in India.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now you can also see, if I turn this around here --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
hopefully I won't shake the world too much.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And this is something that we should really work on,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which come in at thousands per second,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are available everywhere there is power.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
we from time to time will see a query rising up.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And if we had it plotted correctly,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I think the International Space Station would have it, too.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So this is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
some of the challenge that we have here,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
there we go.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is how we have to move the bits around

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to actually get the people the answers to their questions.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You can see that there's a lot of data running around.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It has to go all over the world: through fibers,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
through satellites, through all kinds of connections.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now what I would like to do is just to show you

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
what one second of this activity would look like.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And if we can switch to slides --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
all right, here we go.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So this is slowed down.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This is what one second looks like.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
is just making sure that we can keep up

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
with this kind of traffic load.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now, each one of those queries

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
has an interesting life and tale of its own.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I mean, it could be somebody's health,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it could be somebody's career, something important to them.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And it could potentially be something

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
as important as tomato sauce,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or in this case, ketchup.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So this is a query that we had --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You can see that it got started right here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
as it did in Spain.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And then from Spain, it went to Italy,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And so I guess the U.S. finally,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
finally started to like it, too.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And I just wanted to play it for you.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
hopefully that search will work.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
As a part of --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
is to have more searches.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And what that means is we want to have

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
more people who are healthy and educated.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
More animals, if they start doing searches as well.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But partly, we want to make the world a better place,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and we're in the process of setting that up.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We also have a program already called Google Grants

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that now serves over 150 different charities around the world,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and these are some of the charities that are on there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
In fact, many of the organizations that are here --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
so they can let organizations know.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
One of the earlier results that we got --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
many, many stories that have come in,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because we do have hundreds of charities in there,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Now does anybody know who this is?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
A-ha!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Audience: Orkut.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
SB: Yes! Somebody got it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Do we have any?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Okay, not very many people know about it.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'll explain it in a second.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
This is one of our engineers.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
That's how we churn those products out.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So this is what he built.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We just released it in a test phase last month,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and it's been taking off.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
This is our VP of Engineering.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And these are all of his friends.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So this is how -- we just deployed it --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and all the rest of the countries.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So it's a fun little project.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and see where it goes.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
well, I'll leave you in suspense.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Larry, you can explain this one.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
went to a Montessori school,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and I think, for some reason,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
this has been incorporated in Google.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And many, many things at Google have come out of that,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
such as Orkut and also Google News.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
as a hobby, basically.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So many, many useful things come out of this.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And News, which I just mentioned,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
was started by a researcher.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And so he started clustering it by category,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
we made it a Googlette,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
which is basically a small project at Google.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So it'd be like three people, or something like that,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and they would try to make a product.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
working on it for a while, and then more and more people

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and more and more people started using it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And this is how we keep our innovation running.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I think usually, as companies get bigger,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
"Oh, we really need a new concept."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And I don't know about all of you,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And we found that if we just wrote all of them down

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Don't really pay attention to them.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We would never do such a crazy thing, but --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
which you did by writing them down,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and where to put your resources.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And so that's basically what we've done

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and still stay reasonably well-organized.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and so naturally,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that are new, or you might not know about.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Raise your hands.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
How many of you use the Deskbar?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
All right, see? You guys should try it out.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But if you go to our site and search

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
for "Deskbar," you'll get this.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
on your screen on the bottom,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and you can do searches really easily.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Thank you, Sergey.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This is another example of a project that somebody at Google

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
you can type a question in,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and then there's a pool of researchers

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and you can get actually very good answers to things

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
without spending all that time yourself.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Froogle lets you search shopping information,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and Blogger lets you publish things.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
you know, we try many, many different things

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
in our company.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We also like to innovate in our physical space,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
for projectors to turn on and off,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they're noisy, so people shut them off.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And we didn't like that, so we actually,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and they're completely silent.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And as a result, we were able to build some software

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that also lets us manage a meeting,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
so when you walk into a meeting room now,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
it lists all the meetings that are happening,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to all the people that were present in the meeting.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And as we become more of a global company,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
we find these things really affect us --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And so we found it was pretty helpful

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
we also allow dogs and things like that,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
This is actually our "cult picture."

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I just wanted to show quickly.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We had this on our website for a while,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
but we found that after we put it on our website,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
we didn't get any job applications anymore.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But anyway, every year we've taken

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the whole company on a ski trip.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It makes it a really fun place to work.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
our culture when we change things.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
In the early days, we were actually advised

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we should never change our logo because

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we should establish our brand, you know,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You want it to be consistent.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Why don't we try changing it every day?"

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is we have this thing called AdSense,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and this is a little bit foreshadowing --

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
this is from before Dean dropped out.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
we show you relevant ads.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And these ads are generated automatically --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
like in this case, on the Washington Post --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
from the content on the site.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
much as we do on search.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So the idea is we can make advertising useful,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
not just annoying, right?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And the nice thing about this,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
we have a self-serve program,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and many thousands of websites have signed up,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and this let's them really make money. And I --

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you know, there's a number of people I met --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And, you know, thank you.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I don't have to do my other job now."

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
when people can really make their livelihood

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
from producing great content.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So this session is supposed to be about the future,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
you really have to be smart.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and you expect an answer back, right?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It would be artificial intelligence.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And so that's something we work on,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and we even have some people who are excited enough

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and crazy enough to work on it now,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and that's really their goal.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So we always hope that Google will be smart,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
This is a blog from Iraq,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and it's not really what

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So we decided --

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
but we decided we should put in this feature

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
into our AdSense ads, called "related searches."

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq --

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and you know, in addition to the ads,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and we thought this would be a great idea.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And so there is this blog

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
He was just kind of writing about his life.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
but our algorithms, our computers --

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
read his blog and decided that

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
the related search was, "I am bored."

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
that he was boring,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
and it was very unfortunate,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Why don't they like my blog?"

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
sort of going from bad to worse,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and we said the related search was, "Retards."

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And then, you know, he got even more mad,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And then we produced "You suck."

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and of course, you know,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
and it didn't quite work,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
and we don't have this feature anymore.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I wanted to end just by saying that

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
there's a couple things that really make me excited

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to be involved with Google,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
and one of those is that we're able to make money

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
was that we're able to serve everyone in the world

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
for example, for less money in places that are poor,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
for example, with the drug industry.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
because everyone in the world has access to our search,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
to provide people the right information,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
that we should provide very objective information.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
We accept payment for advertising,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and we mark it as such.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And that's unlike many of our competitors.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And I think decisions we're able to make like that

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
have a tremendous impact on the world,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
So thank you.
