Chris Anderson: This is such
a strange thing.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.817
Your software, Linux,
is in millions of computers,

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.388
it probably powers much of the Internet.

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:24.175
And I think that there are, like,

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.544
a billion and a half active
Android devices out there.

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:30.169
Your software is in every
single one of them.

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:31.958
It's kind of amazing.

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:37.017
You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this.

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.347
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
when I saw a picture of it.

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:41.571
I mean, this is --

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:43.845
this is the Linux world headquarters.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.859
(Laughter)

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:49.889
(Applause)

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:52.199
Linus Torvalds: It really
doesn't look like much.

00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:53.899
And I have to say,

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:57.743
the most interesting part in this picture,

00:00:57.767 --> 00:00:59.470
that people mostly react to,

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:00.937
is the walking desk.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.660
It is the most interesting
part in my office

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:05.644
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:07.960
And I think the two things are related.

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:11.531
The way I work is ...

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:17.594
I want to not have external stimulation.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.437
You can kind of see,
on the walls are this light green.

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:27.925
I'm told that at mental institutions
they use that on the walls.

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:28.996
(Laughter)

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.805
It's like a calming color,

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.946
it's not something
that really stimulates you.

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:39.489
What you can't see is the computer here,
you only see the screen,

00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:42.894
but the main thing I worry
about in my computer is --

00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:46.253
it doesn't have to be big
and powerful, although I like that --

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:49.109
it really has to be completely silent.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.986
I know people who work for Google

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.217
and they have their own
small data center at home,

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:56.393
and I don't do that.

00:01:56.417 --> 00:02:00.122
My office is the most
boring office you'll ever see.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:03.660
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:06.173
If the cat comes up,

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.034
it sits in my lap.

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:10.248
And I want to hear the cat purring,

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:13.446
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.779
CA: So this is astonishing,

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:17.481
because working this way,

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:20.493
you're able to run this vast
technology empire --

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:21.738
it is an empire --

00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:25.462
so that's an amazing testament
to the power of open source.

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:29.662
Tell us how you got
to understand open source

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.938
and how it lead
to the development of Linux.

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.051
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.642
Really -- I work alone in my house,

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.056
often in my bathrobe.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.641
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:43.951
so I have clothes on.

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:45.212
(Laughter)

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:47.308
And that's how I've always worked.

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:49.340
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:53.013
I did not start Linux
as a collaborative project.

00:02:53.037 --> 00:02:57.915
I started it as one
in a series of many projects

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.896
I had done at the time for myself,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.822
partly because I needed the end result,

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:06.148
but even more because I just
enjoyed programming.

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:10.546
So it was about the end of the journey,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.916
which, 25 years later,
we still have not reached.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.657
But it was really about the fact
that I was looking for a project on my own

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.510
and there was no open source,
really, on my radar at all.

00:03:21.988 --> 00:03:24.000
And what happened is ...

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:29.220
the project grows and becomes something
you want to show off to people.

00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:34.669
Really, this is more of a, "Wow,
look at what I did!"

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:37.248
And trust me -- it was not
that great back then.

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:40.002
I made it publicly available,

00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:42.132
and it wasn't even
open source at that point.

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:47.325
At that point it was source that was open,
but there was no intention

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.463
behind using the kind of open-source
methodology that we think of today

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:53.638
to improve it.

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:54.813
It was more like,

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:57.774
"Look, I've been working
on this for half a year,

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.198
I'd love to have comments."

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:02.717
And other people approached me.

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:04.869
At the University of Helsinki,

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:08.608
I had a friend who was one
of the open source --

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:12.288
it was called mainly
"free software" back then --

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:16.586
and he actually introduced me
to the notion that, hey,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.967
you can use these open-source
licenses that had been around.

00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:26.155
And I thought about it for a while.

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:29.670
I was actually worried about the whole
commercial interests coming in.

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:34.168
I mean, that's one of the worries
I think most people who start out have,

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:39.152
is that they worry about somebody
taking advantage of their work, right?

00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:42.859
And I decided, "What the hell?"

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.890
And --

00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:46.209
CA: And then at some point,

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:48.693
someone contributed
some code that you thought,

00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:51.888
"Wow, that really is interesting,
I would not have thought of that.

00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:53.563
This could actually improve this."

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.112
LT: It didn't even start
by people contributing code,

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:59.115
it was more that people
started contributing ideas.

00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:02.994
And just the fact that somebody else
takes a look at your project --

00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:05.566
and I'm sure it's true
of other things, too,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.427
but it's definitely true in code --

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.950
is that somebody else
takes an interest in your code,

00:05:10.974 --> 00:05:13.496
looks at it enough to actually
give you feedback

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.409
and give you ideas.

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.134
That was a huge thing for me.

00:05:17.158 --> 00:05:20.350
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:23.611
but I had already programmed
for half my life, basically.

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:28.344
And every project before that
had been completely personal

00:05:28.368 --> 00:05:31.475
and it was a revelation when people
just started commenting,

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.800
started giving feedback on your code.

00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:38.596
And even before they started
giving code back,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.361
that was, I think, one of the big
moments where I said,

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:43.258
"I love other people!"

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.439
Don't get me wrong --

00:05:44.463 --> 00:05:46.087
I'm actually not a people person.

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.476
(Laughter)

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.052
I don't really love other people --

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.096
(Laughter)

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.746
But I love computers,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.985
I love interacting with other
people on email,

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.341
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:06.866
But I do love other people who comment
and get involved in my project.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.543
And it made it so much more.

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:12.107
CA: So was there a moment
when you saw what was being built

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.338
and it suddenly started taking off,

00:06:14.362 --> 00:06:17.652
and you thought, "Wait a sec,
this actually could be something huge,

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:20.588
not just a personal project
that I'm getting nice feedback on,

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:24.932
but a kind of explosive development
in the whole technology world"?

00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.980
LT: Not really.

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.576
I mean, the big point for me, really,
was not when it was becoming huge,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.734
it was when it was becoming little.

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:37.226
The big point for me was not being alone

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.967
and having 10, maybe 100
people being involved --

00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:42.470
that was a big point.

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:45.533
Then everything else was very gradual.

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:49.816
Going from 100 people to a million people
is not a big deal -- to me.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.673
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:52.698
(Laughter)

00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:55.440
If you want to sell your result
then it's a huge deal --

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:56.615
don't get me wrong.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.766
But if you're interested in the technology

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.645
and you're interested in the project,

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.550
the big part was getting the community.

00:07:02.574 --> 00:07:04.198
Then the community grew gradually.

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:07.570
And there's actually not
a single point where I went like,

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.342
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:13.690
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:16.690
CA: So all the technologists
that I talk to really credit you

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:19.588
with massively changing their work.

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:21.235
And it's not just Linux,

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:22.705
it's this thing called Git,

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.741
which is this management system
for software development.

00:07:26.765 --> 00:07:29.550
Tell us briefly about that
and your role in that.

00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:32.270
LT: So one of the issues we had,

00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:35.346
and this took a while to start to appear,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.525
is when you ...

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:43.040
When you grow from having 10 people
or 100 people working on a project

00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:45.452
to having 10,000 people, which --

00:07:45.476 --> 00:07:48.942
I mean, right now we're in the situation
where just on the kernel,

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:52.140
we have 1,000 people involved
in every single release

00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:55.750
and that's every two months,
roughly two or three months.

00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.757
Some of those people don't do a lot.

00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:01.364
There's a lot of people
who make small, small changes.

00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:03.634
But to maintain this,

00:08:03.658 --> 00:08:06.547
the scale changes how
you have to maintain it.

00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.969
And we went through a lot of pain.

00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:17.242
And there are whole projects
that do only source-code maintenance.

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:20.558
CVS is the one that used to be
the most commonly used,

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:24.479
and I hated CVS with a passion
and refused to touch it

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.566
and tried something else
that was radical and interesting

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.246
and everybody else hated.

00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:32.378
CA: (Laughs)

00:08:32.402 --> 00:08:34.490
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.331
where we had thousands of people
who wanted to participate,

00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:42.396
but in many ways,
I was the kind of break point,

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.944
where I could not scale to the point

00:08:44.968 --> 00:08:47.768
where I could work
with thousands of people.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:50.244
So Git is my second big project,

00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:54.806
which was only created for me
to maintain my first big project.

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:57.680
And this is literally how I work.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.209
I don't code for --

00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:01.955
well, I do code for fun --

00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:04.360
but I want to code
for something meaningful

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:08.431
so every single project I've ever done
has been something I needed

00:09:08.455 --> 00:09:09.831
and --

00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:13.288
CA: So really, both Linux
and Git kind of arose

00:09:13.312 --> 00:09:15.648
almost as an unintended consequence

00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:18.343
of your desire not to have
to work with too many people.

00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:19.518
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:20.622
(Laughter)

00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:22.296
CA: That's amazing.
LT: Yeah.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.812
(Applause)

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:27.227
And yet, you're the man
who's transformed technology

00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:28.568
not just once but twice,

00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:31.175
and we have to try
and understand why it is.

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:32.883
You've given us some clues, but ...

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:37.548
Here's a picture of you as a kid,
with a Rubik's Cube.

00:09:37.572 --> 00:09:41.692
You mentioned that you've been
programming since you were like 10 or 11,

00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:43.081
half your life.

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:46.921
Were you this sort of computer
genius, you know, übernerd,

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.430
were you the star at school
who could do everything?

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:50.986
What were you like as a kid?

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.623
LT: Yeah, I think I was
the prototypical nerd.

00:09:54.647 --> 00:09:55.916
I mean, I was ...

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.092
I was not a people person back then.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:01.696
That's my younger brother.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.507
I was clearly more interested
in the Rubik's Cube

00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:06.056
than my younger brother.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.167
(Laughter)

00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:10.311
My younger sister,
who's not in the picture,

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:12.749
when we had family meetings --

00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:16.565
and it's not a huge family, but I have,
like, a couple of cousins --

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:19.453
she would prep me beforehand.

00:10:19.477 --> 00:10:22.043
Like, before I stepped
into the room she would say,

00:10:22.067 --> 00:10:24.610
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.254
Because I was not --

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:29.493
I was a geek.

00:10:29.517 --> 00:10:30.683
I was into computers,

00:10:30.707 --> 00:10:31.866
I was into math,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.041
I was into physics.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.216
I was good at that.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.026
I don't think I was
particularly exceptional.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.945
Apparently, my sister said

00:10:39.969 --> 00:10:46.820
that my biggest exceptional quality
was that I would not let go.

00:10:47.618 --> 00:10:50.175
CA: OK, so let's go there,
because that's interesting.

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:51.373
You would not let go.

00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:54.262
So that's not about being
a geek and being smart,

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:57.391
that's about being ... stubborn?

00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:58.942
LT: That's about being stubborn.

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:00.354
That's about, like,

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:03.293
just starting something

00:11:03.317 --> 00:11:08.767
and not saying, "OK, I'm done,
let's do something else --

00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:09.978
Look: shiny!"

00:11:10.954 --> 00:11:14.335
And I notice that in many
other parts in my life, too.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.720
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:22.856
And I worked for the same
company, in Silicon Valley,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.594
for the whole time.

00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:26.156
That is unheard of.

00:11:27.204 --> 00:11:28.971
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:32.574
The whole point of Silicon Valley
is that people jump between jobs

00:11:32.598 --> 00:11:35.225
to kind of mix up the pot.

00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:37.129
And that's not the kind of person I am.

00:11:37.153 --> 00:11:39.724
CA: But during the actual
development of Linux itself,

00:11:39.748 --> 00:11:44.044
that stubbornness sometimes brought
you in conflict with other people.

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.099
Talk about that a bit.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:51.667
Was that essential to sort of maintain
the quality of what was being built?

00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:53.856
How would you describe what happened?

00:11:54.392 --> 00:11:56.475
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:00.384
Going back to the "I'm not
a people person," --

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:02.196
sometimes I'm also ...

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.633
shall we say,

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:09.077
"myopic" when it comes
to other people's feelings,

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:14.945
and that sometimes makes you
say things that hurt other people.

00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:18.737
And I'm not proud of that.

00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:19.875
(Applause)

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:21.697
But, at the same time, it's --

00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:26.054
I get people who tell me
that I should be nice.

00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:32.464
And then when I try to explain to them
that maybe you're nice,

00:12:32.488 --> 00:12:34.742
maybe you should be more aggressive,

00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:38.308
they see that as me being not nice.

00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:40.442
(Laughter)

00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:42.634
What I'm trying to say
is we are different.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:44.468
I'm not a people person;

00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:46.598
it's not something
I'm particularly proud of,

00:12:46.622 --> 00:12:48.162
but it's part of me.

00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:50.891
And one of the things
I really like about open source

00:12:50.915 --> 00:12:56.707
is it really allows different
people to work together.

00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:58.455
We don't have to like each other --

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.682
and sometimes we really
don't like each other.

00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:04.193
Really -- I mean, there are very,
very heated arguments.

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:07.209
But you can, actually,
you can find things that --

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:10.554
you don't even agree to disagree,

00:13:10.578 --> 00:13:13.624
it's just that you're interested
in really different things.

00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:16.551
And coming back to the point
where I said earlier

00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:20.868
that I was afraid of commercial people
taking advantage of your work,

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:23.491
it turned out, and very
quickly turned out,

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:26.481
that those commercial people
were lovely, lovely people.

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:30.211
And they did all the things that I was not
at all interested in doing,

00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.292
and they had completely different goals.

00:13:32.316 --> 00:13:37.639
And they used open source in ways
that I just did not want to go.

00:13:37.663 --> 00:13:39.925
But because it was open
source they could do it,

00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:42.301
and it actually works
really beautifully together.

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:44.349
And I actually think
it works the same way.

00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:47.578
You need to have the people-people,
the communicators,

00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:49.029
the warm and friendly people

00:13:49.053 --> 00:13:50.775
who like --

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:52.241
(Laughter)

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.315
really want to hug you
and get you into the community.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.910
But that's not everybody.

00:13:56.934 --> 00:13:58.366
And that's not me.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.847
I care about the technology.

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:01.752
There are people who care about the UI.

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:04.846
I can't do UI to save my life.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.891
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:11.315
and the only way to get off that island
was the make a pretty UI,

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:12.502
I'd die there.

00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:13.677
(Laughter)

00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:15.840
So there's different kinds of people,

00:14:15.864 --> 00:14:18.729
and I'm not making excuses,
I'm trying to explain.

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:20.419
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.928
you talked about some
other trait that you have,

00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:24.543
which I found really interesting.

00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:25.950
It's this idea called taste.

00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:27.976
And I've just got a couple of images here.

00:14:28.354 --> 00:14:32.357
I think this is an example of not
particularly good taste in code,

00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:35.372
and this one is better taste,

00:14:35.396 --> 00:14:37.459
which one can immediately see.

00:14:37.483 --> 00:14:39.456
What is the difference between these two?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.821
LT: So this is --

00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:44.522
How many people here actually have coded?

00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.191
CA: Oh my goodness.

00:14:47.215 --> 00:14:48.370
LT: So I guarantee you,

00:14:48.394 --> 00:14:49.939
everybody who raised their hand,

00:14:49.963 --> 00:14:52.584
they have done what's called
a singly-linked list.

00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:54.617
And it's taught --

00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:58.706
This, the first not very
good taste approach,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.797
is basically how it's taught to be done
when you start out coding.

00:15:02.821 --> 00:15:04.865
And you don't have to understand the code.

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:06.945
The most interesting part to me

00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:09.158
is the last if statement.

00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:13.193
Because what happens
in a singly-linked list --

00:15:13.217 --> 00:15:16.867
this is trying to remove
an existing entry from a list --

00:15:16.891 --> 00:15:20.733
and there's a difference
between if it's the first entry

00:15:20.757 --> 00:15:22.756
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.385
Because if it's the first entry,

00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:27.425
you have to change
the pointer to the first entry.

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:28.647
If it's in the middle,

00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:31.092
you have to change the pointer
of a previous entry.

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.140
So they're two completely different cases.

00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:34.316
CA: And that's better.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.521
LT: And this is better.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.263
It does not have the if statement.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:40.850
And it doesn't really matter --

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:44.075
I don't want you understand
why it doesn't have the if statement,

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:45.441
but I want you to understand

00:15:45.465 --> 00:15:48.090
that sometimes you can see
a problem in a different way

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.468
and rewrite it so that
a special case goes away

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.369
and becomes the normal case.

00:15:53.393 --> 00:15:54.932
And that's good code.

00:15:55.328 --> 00:15:56.878
But this is simple code.

00:15:56.902 --> 00:15:58.251
This is CS 101.

00:15:58.275 --> 00:16:01.131
This is not important --
although, details are important.

00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:05.876
To me, the sign of people
I really want to work with

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.573
is that they have good taste,
which is how ...

00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:10.892
I sent you this stupid example

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:13.260
that is not relevant
because it's too small.

00:16:13.743 --> 00:16:15.885
Good taste is much bigger than this.

00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:19.930
Good taste is about really
seeing the big patterns

00:16:19.954 --> 00:16:24.412
and kind of instinctively knowing
what's the right way to do things.

00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:27.093
CA: OK, so we're putting
the pieces together here now.

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.203
You have taste,

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.394
in a way that's meaningful
to software people.

00:16:32.418 --> 00:16:33.569
You're --

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.409
(Laughter)

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:37.994
LT: I think it was meaningful
to some people here.

00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:42.884
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:44.605
and you're hellish stubborn.

00:16:45.622 --> 00:16:47.208
But there must be something else.

00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:48.855
I mean, you've changed the future.

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:51.842
You must have the ability
of these grand visions of the future.

00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:53.127
You're a visionary, right?

00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:55.742
LT: I've actually felt slightly
uncomfortable at TED

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.926
for the last two days,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.545
because there's a lot
of vision going on, right?

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:02.266
And I am not a visionary.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.519
I do not have a five-year plan.

00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:05.901
I'm an engineer.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.185
And I think it's really --

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:09.528
I mean -- I'm perfectly
happy with all the people

00:17:09.552 --> 00:17:12.303
who are walking around
and just staring at the clouds

00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:15.178
and looking at the stars
and saying, "I want to go there."

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.654
But I'm looking at the ground,

00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:19.533
and I want to fix the pothole
that's right in front of me

00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:20.917
before I fall in.

00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:22.560
This is the kind of person I am.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.695
(Cheers)

00:17:23.719 --> 00:17:25.031
(Applause)

00:17:25.055 --> 00:17:28.666
CA: So you spoke to me last week
about these two guys.

00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:31.793
Who are they and how
do you relate to them?

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:35.841
LT: Well, so this is kind
of cliché in technology,

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:37.872
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:42.837
where Tesla is seen as the visionary
scientist and crazy idea man.

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:45.643
And people love Tesla.

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:48.654
I mean, there are people who name
their companies after him.

00:17:48.678 --> 00:17:49.828
(Laughter)

00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:53.977
The other person there is Edison,

00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.508
who is actually often vilified
for being kind of pedestrian

00:17:57.532 --> 00:17:59.453
and is --

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:02.199
I mean, his most famous quote is,

00:18:02.223 --> 00:18:06.937
"Genius is one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration."

00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:08.847
And I'm in the Edison camp,

00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:11.055
even if people don't always like him.

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:14.098
Because if you actually compare the two,

00:18:14.122 --> 00:18:18.655
Tesla has kind of this mind
grab these days,

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:20.678
but who actually changed the world?

00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:25.235
Edison may not have been a nice person,

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:28.391
he did a lot of things --

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:30.844
he was maybe not so intellectual,

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:33.095
not so visionary.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:36.780
But I think I'm more
of an Edison than a Tesla.

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:40.107
CA: So our theme at TED
this week is dreams --

00:18:40.131 --> 00:18:41.478
big, bold, audacious dreams.

00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:43.304
You're really the antidote to that.

00:18:43.328 --> 00:18:45.437
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:46.612
CA: That's good.

00:18:46.636 --> 00:18:47.716
(Laughter)

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.345
We embrace you, we embrace you.

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:53.795
Companies like Google and many
others have made, arguably,

00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:56.025
like, billions of dollars
out of your software.

00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:57.200
Does that piss you off?

00:18:57.224 --> 00:18:58.375
LT: No.

00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:01.033
No, it doesn't piss me off
for several reasons.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.067
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:04.387
I'm really doing fine.

00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:06.526
But the other reason is --

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.877
I mean, without doing the whole
open source and really letting go thing,

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.127
Linux would never have been what it is.

00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:19.247
And it's brought experiences
I don't really enjoy, public talking,

00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:21.422
but at the same time,
this is an experience.

00:19:21.446 --> 00:19:22.726
Trust me.

00:19:23.238 --> 00:19:28.381
So there's a lot of things going on
that make me a very happy man

00:19:28.405 --> 00:19:30.934
and thinking I did the right choices.

00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.870
CA: Is the open source idea --

00:19:32.894 --> 00:19:34.530
this is, I think we'll end here --

00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:38.608
is the open source idea
fully realized now in the world,

00:19:38.632 --> 00:19:41.650
or is there more that it could go,

00:19:41.674 --> 00:19:43.689
are there more things that it could do?

00:19:44.738 --> 00:19:46.972
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

00:19:46.996 --> 00:19:51.482
I think one reason open source
works so well in code

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.915
is that at the end of the day,

00:19:53.939 --> 00:19:57.185
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:01.366
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.336
this is done correctly
and this is not done well.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.738
Code either works or it doesn't,

00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:12.370
which means that there's less
room for arguments.

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:16.025
And we have arguments despite this, right?

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.964
In many other areas --

00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:21.729
I mean, people have talked about
open politics and things like that --

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:24.702
and it's really hard sometimes to say

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:28.483
that, yes, you can apply the same
principles in some other areas

00:20:28.507 --> 00:20:33.946
just because the black and white
turns into not just gray,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.573
but different colors.

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:40.705
So, obviously open source in science
is making a comeback.

00:20:40.729 --> 00:20:42.363
Science was there first.

00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:45.054
But then science ended up
being pretty closed,

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:48.702
with very expensive journals
and some of that going on.

00:20:48.726 --> 00:20:52.562
And open source is making
a comeback in science,

00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:56.733
with things like arXiv and open journals.

00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:01.215
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:02.693
So there are other examples,

00:21:02.717 --> 00:21:04.350
I'm sure there are more to come.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.227
CA: But you're not a visionary,

00:21:07.251 --> 00:21:09.204
and so it's not up to you to name them.

00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:10.387
LT: No.

00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:11.459
(Laughter)

00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:13.447
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:14.734
CA: Exactly.

00:21:14.758 --> 00:21:15.916
Linus Torvalds,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.185
thank you for Linux,
thank you for the Internet,

00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:20.074
thank you for all those Android phones.

00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:23.295
Thank you for coming here to TED
and revealing so much of yourself.

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.471
LT: Thank you.

00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:28.935
(Applause)
