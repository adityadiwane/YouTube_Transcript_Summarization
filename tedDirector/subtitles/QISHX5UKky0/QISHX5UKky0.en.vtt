00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
which I did across the North Pole.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And while that swim took place three years ago,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I can remember it as if it was yesterday.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I remember standing on the edge of the ice,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
about to dive into the water,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and thinking to myself, I have never ever

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
seen any place on this earth

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
which is just so frightening.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
The water is completely black.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
It's flipping freezing in that water.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And then a thought came across my mind:

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
if things go pear-shaped on this swim,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
how long will it take for my frozen body

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
to sink the four and a half kilometers

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
to the bottom of the ocean?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
out of my mind as quickly as possible.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And the only way I can dive

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
into that freezing cold water

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and swim a kilometer

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
listening to everything from beautiful opera

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
all the way across to Puff Daddy,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and then committing myself a hundred percent --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and then walking up to the edge of the ice

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and just diving into the water.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And that swim took me

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
18 minutes and 50 seconds,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and it felt like 18 days.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And I remember getting out of the water

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
and my hands feeling so painful

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
and looking down at my fingers,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and my fingers were literally the size of sausages

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
because -- you know, we're made partially of water --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
when water freezes it expands,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and so the cells in my fingers

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
had frozen and expanded

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and burst.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
was the following:

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I'm never, ever

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
going to do another cold water swim

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
in my life again.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and the melting of the -- (Laughter)

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and the melting of the glaciers

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
because of climate change.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
because of the melting of the glacier.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and left in its place this big lake.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And I firmly believe

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
that what we're seeing in the Himalayas

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
is the next great, big battleground

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
on this earth.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Nearly two billion people --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
so one in three people on this earth --

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
rely on the water from the Himalayas.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and with the water supply from these glaciers --

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
because of climate change --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
decreasing so much,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I think we have a real risk of instability.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
all these countries.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And so I decided

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to walk up to Mt. Everest,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
the highest mountain on this earth,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and go and do a symbolic swim

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
underneath the summit

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
of Mt. Everest.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
28 great, big, powerful yaks

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I don't just have my Speedo,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
but there's a big film crew who then

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
send all the images around the world.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
is not just the altitude.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So it's right up in the heavens.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
just hitting your head all the time.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
That's not the worst part of it.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and this was the year they decided to go

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and then bring them down the mountain.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And when you're walking up the mountain

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
to attempt to do something

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
When you're trying to do that,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and then the bodies are coming past you,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
it humbles you,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and you also realize very, very clearly

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that nature is so much more powerful

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
than we are.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And we walked up this pathway,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
all the way up.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And to the right hand side of us

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
was this great Khumbu Glacier.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And all the way along the glacier we saw

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
these big pools of melting ice.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And then we got up to this small lake

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
and I prepared myself

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
the same way as I've always prepared myself,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I got myself as aggressive as possible --

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
but controlled aggression --

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and then I hurled myself

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
into that water.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
I swam as quickly as I could

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
for the first hundred meters,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and then I realized very, very quickly,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I had a huge problem on my hands.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I could barely breathe.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
I was gasping for air.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
I then began to choke,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And it all happened so quickly:

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And luckily, the water was quite shallow,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and get up and then take another gasp of air.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
I carried on for another five or six strokes,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and then I had nothing in my body,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and I went down to the bottom of the lake.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And I don't where I got it from,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
but I was able to somehow

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
pull myself up and as quickly as possible

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
get to the side of the lake.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
I've heard it said that drowning

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
is the most peaceful death that you can have.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
I have never, ever heard

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
such utter bollocks.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Laughter)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
that you can have.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
I got myself to the side of the lake.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
My crew grabbed me,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and then we walked as quickly as we could

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
down -- over the rubble --

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
down to our camp.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
And there, we sat down,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
there on Mt. Everest.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And my team just gave it to me straight.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
They said, Lewis, you need to have

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
a radical tactical shift

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
if you want to do this swim.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Every single thing which you have learned

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
in the past 23 years of swimming,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
you must forget.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Every single thing which you learned

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
when you were serving in the British army,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
about speed and aggression,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
you put that to one side.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Take some time to rest and think about things.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and instead of swimming fast,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
swim as slowly as possible.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
This is the time to swim

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
with real humility.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And so we walked back up

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to the mountain two days later.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And I stood there

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
on the edge of the lake,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and I looked up at Mt. Everest --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
and I said to myself, just do this slowly.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And I swam across the lake.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And I can't begin to tell you

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
how good I felt

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
when I came to the other side.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
But I learned two very, very

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
important lessons there on Mt. Everest,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
The first one is

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
that just because something has worked in the past so well,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And similarly,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
now, before I do anything,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
I ask myself what type of mindset

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
do I require

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
to successfully complete a task.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And taking that into the world of climate change --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
which is, frankly,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
the Mt. Everest of all problems --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
just because we have consumed the way we have for so long

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
and populated the earth the way we have for so long,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
doesn't mean that we can carry on

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
the way we are carrying on.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The warning signs are all there.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
When I was born, the world's population

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
was 3.5 billion people.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
We're now 6.8 billion people,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
and we're expected to be 9 billion people

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
by 2050.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
And then the second lesson,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
the radical, tactical shift.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And I've come here to ask you today:

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
what radical tactical shift

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
can you take in your relationship to the environment,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
which will ensure

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
that our children and our grandchildren

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
live in a safe world

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and a secure world,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and most importantly, in a sustainable world?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
And I ask you, please, to go away from here

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
and think about that one

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
radical tactical shift

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
which you could make,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
which will make that big difference,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
and commit a hundred percent,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
because very, very few things

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
are impossible to achieve

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
if we really put our whole minds to it.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So thank you very, very much.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.260
(Applause)
