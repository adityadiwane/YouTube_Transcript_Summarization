00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country --

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I applied for university at a time when I was convinced

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.160
My family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
And he was a clever man. He sort of said,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.160
"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs."

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts:

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
this was my passion.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want --

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.160
And I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
because it was art and mathematics put together.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
He said to me something that just went completely over my head.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
but I don't like grey pin-striped suits."

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
And I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.160
and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
That really, the mixing of art and science was computers,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Something that would be important, but also something

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.160
that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160
knowing people who were either executives or wealthy,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160
and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
My career, I mean, I'd done my career.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
Didn't have to worry about earning money.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.160
And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
and bringing to the world the access of the computers,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
that that was really the thing we should do.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160
(Applause)

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Those are conveyor belts that go around.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
but then you'll see the ones up above.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
and then test them for a few hours.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160
So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.160
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
just the same way as our kids do here.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are --

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
to help them debug it. OK?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.160
We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 --

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
April 11 to be precise -- called "Teaching Children Thinking."

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
understand things differently, and when they debug the programs,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
they come the closest to learning about learning.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Kids don't program enough and boy,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
It's really important. Using applications is OK,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
but programming is absolutely fundamental.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
a third, that I've never even seen before.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
This photograph is very important because it's much later.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160
many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160
And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160
plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.160
This is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.160
being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
There are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160
one, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.160
I'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.160
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive --

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
you can get the best people in the world.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
If you look at our professional services, including search firms,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.160
including communications, including legal services, including banking,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
and they're the best people.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
and we had a queue of people.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
was very important, and the U.N. allowed us

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.160
to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
before I met Yves Behar.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
And while this machine in some sense is silly,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.160
That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank --

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do --

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.160
I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things --

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
there are four of them --

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160
and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
That the reason that you want to be below two watts is

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
And that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter)

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
And, in English, the word "cheap" has

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
a double meaning, which is really appropriate,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.160
because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.160
But if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing --

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
so you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other --

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.160
and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
And I can race through these and save a lot of time because

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.160
These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.160
But it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody --

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
you know, good design is very important.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160
Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.160
The mesh network, the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail --

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160
but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
they're connected. There's not just laptops.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
And so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.160
If you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160
If you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
or walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
They're not going to be near another laptop,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.160
so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.160
You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And that's very important, the user interface.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.160
We are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.160
I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Is there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.160
the keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand -- so you get it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
There is no keyboard standard because there's no market.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
And this is the big difference.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160
So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning --

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Here's the six. We went to the six,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.160
In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
And so I went to each of those countries

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Not something you'd envy or want to do.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
The camel smells were unbelievable.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
And it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries --

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
I say former, because none of them really came through this summer --

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
there was a big difference between getting a head of state

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
to have a photo opportunity, make a press release.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
Small country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
but just a vanilla laptop proposal.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
And guess what? We won it hands down.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.160
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
The next day -- the next day, not even 24 hours had passed -- in Peru,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
the president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
And boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
still not enough.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.160
"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end --

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
We thought that was a good time to announce it.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
Launched it on the 12 of November.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.160
We said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.160
it got a lot of people absolutely interested.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
The first day it was just wild. And then we said,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.160
but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:16.160
buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
whatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah, great.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
I want you do something else.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
And it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
I invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Tell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Get your friends to give one, get one.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
I won't dwell on the pricing at all.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
Just to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,"

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160
a lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
It will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.160
We've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do --

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160
I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160
24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.160
The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
and I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160
They went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
And it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.160
but we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
maybe by the middle of the year,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
to hit a million a month. Now put that number,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
And the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
we're going to make 20 percent of the world production.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160
And if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
And we hope if you have EG two years from now,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
or whenever you have it again,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
I won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
and will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.160
Thank you.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
(Applause)
