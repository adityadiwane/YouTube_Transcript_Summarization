00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
where the power dynamics between men and women

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
are shifting very rapidly,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and in many of the places where it counts the most,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
women are, in fact, taking control of everything.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Not a lot of women did.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And now, for every two men who get a college degree,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
three women will do the same.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Women, for the first time this year,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
became the majority of the American workforce.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
doctors, lawyers,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
bankers, accountants.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and in the 15 professions

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
projected to grow the most in the next decade,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
all but two of them are dominated by women.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
So the global economy is becoming a place

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
where women are more successful than men,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
believe it or not,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and these economic changes

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
are starting to rapidly affect our culture --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
what our romantic comedies look like,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
what our marriages look like,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
what our dating lives look like,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and our new set of superheroes.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
tough, rugged,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
in control of his own environment.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and replaced by this

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
much less impressive specimen,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
who is a parody of American manhood,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and that's what we have in our commercials today.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
The phrase "first-born son"

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
that this statistic alone shocked me.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
In American fertility clinics,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
75 percent of couples

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
are requesting girls and not boys.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
And in places where you wouldn't think,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
such as South Korea, India and China,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
the very strict patriarchal societies

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
are starting to break down a little,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and families are no longer

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
strongly preferring first-born sons.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and start to connect the dots,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
you can see the evidence everywhere.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
You can see it in college graduation patterns,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
in job projections,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
in our marriage statistics,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
that something amazing and unprecedented

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
is happening with women.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
But the difference is that, back then,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
that was trying to project its own desires,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
whereas this time, it's not about passion,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and it's not about any kind of movement.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
This is really just about the facts

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
of this economic moment that we live in.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
The 200,000-year period

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
in which men have been top dog

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and that's why I talk about the "end of men."

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Now all you men out there,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
because the point is that this

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
is happening to all of us.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
I myself have a husband and a father

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and two sons whom I dearly love.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
And this is why I like to talk about this,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
because if we don't acknowledge it,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
then the transition will be pretty painful.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
But if we do take account of it,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
then I think it will go much more smoothly.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and I started to notice a distinct pattern --

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that the recession was affecting men

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
much more deeply than it was affecting women.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
when I read a book by Susan Faludi

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and I started to think about

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And I realized that two things were different this time around.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
The first was that

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
these were no longer just temporary hits

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
that the recession was giving men --

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
that this was reflecting a deeper

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
underlying shift in our global economy.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And second, that the story was no longer

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
just about the crisis of men,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
but it was also about what was happening to women.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
And now look at this second set of slides.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Women, a majority of the workplace.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
This second set of headlines --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And look at that last headline --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
young women earning more than young men.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
They were basically asked by one of their clients

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
And they expected that it would be young families,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
or young men, just like it had always been.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
But in fact, they found something very surprising.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
It was young, single women

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
to do a nationwide survey.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So they spread out all the census data,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
which is that in 1,997

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
out of 2,000 communities,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
women, young women,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
were making more money than young men.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So here you have a generation of young women

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
who grow up thinking of themselves

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
as being more powerful earners

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
than the young men around them.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
and what you'll see on this graph --

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
it begins in 1973,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
just before women start flooding the workforce,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
and it brings us up to our current day.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
And basically what you'll see

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
is what economists talk about

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
as the polarization of the economy.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Now what does that mean?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and low-skill, low-wage jobs --

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This has been going on for 40 years now.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But this process is affecting men

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
very differently than it's affecting women.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
There we go.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
The men sort of stagnate there,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So what's that about?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
that lets them shoot up high.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
But of course, it's not about that.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We used to have a manufacturing economy,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
which was about building goods and products,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and now we have a service economy

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and an information and creative economy.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Those two economies require very different skills,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and as it happens, women have been much better

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
It used to be that you were

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
a guy who went to high school

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
who didn't have a college degree,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
but you had a specific set of skills,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and with the help of a union,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
But that really isn't true anymore.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
This new economy is pretty indifferent

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
to size and strength,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
which is what's helped men along all these years.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
What the economy requires now

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
is a whole different set of skills.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
You basically need intelligence,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
you need an ability to sit still and focus,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to communicate openly,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
to be able to listen to people

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and those are things that women do extremely well,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
as we're seeing.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
If you look at management theory these days,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
it used to be that our ideal leader

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
sounded something like General Patton, right?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
You would be issuing orders from above.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
You would be very hierarchical.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
You would tell everyone below you what to do.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
If you read management books now,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
who can get the employees to talk to each other,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
And those are all things that women do very well.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Women enter the workplace at the top,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and then at the working class,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
all the new jobs that are created

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
So that's childcare,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
elder care and food preparation.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
So those are all the jobs that are growing,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and those are jobs that women tend to do.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Now one day it might be

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that mothers will hire an out-of-work,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
middle-aged, former steelworker guy

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
to watch their children at home,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
you have to look at our future workforce.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
And here the story is fairly simple.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Women are getting college degrees

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
at a faster rate than men.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Why? This is a real mystery.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
to community college, say, and retool themselves,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
learn a new set of skills?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and they can't seem to build the social networks

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
that allow them to get through college.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So for some reason

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
men just don't end up going back to college.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And what's even more disturbing

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
is what's happening with younger boys.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
There's been about a decade of research

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
about what people are calling the "boy crisis."

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Now the boy crisis is this idea

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
that very young boys, for whatever reason,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
are doing worse in school than very young girls,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and people have theories about that.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
and little girls are better at that than little boys?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Or that we require kids to sit still too much,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and so boys initially feel like failures?

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And some people say it's because,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
so I don't have the answer.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to talk to you about

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
why the boys in her class do worse.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
They learn much faster.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
They are more controlled.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
while the girls sat there very nicely.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
HR: So there you go.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
This whole thesis really came home to me

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
working-class college.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that my husband and I would both work,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
and that we would equally raise the children.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
But these college girls

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
had a completely different view of their future.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Basically, the way they said it to me is

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
that they would be working 18 hours a day,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
that their husband would maybe have a job,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And this was kind of a shocker to me.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
"Men are the new ball and chain."

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
(Laughter)

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Now you laugh,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And I think the reason it has a sting

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
is because thousands of years of history

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
don't reverse themselves

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
without a lot of pain,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and that's why I talk about

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
us all going through this together.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
The night after I talked to these college girls,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
I also went to a men's group in Kansas,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
which I spoke to you about earlier.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
They were men who had been contractors,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
or they had been building houses

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And the instructor was up there in the class

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
explaining to them all the ways

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
in which they had lost their identity in this new age.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and they were not really the providers.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
So who were they?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And this was very disheartening for them.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
And what he did was he wrote down on the board

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
"$85,000,"

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and he said, "That's her salary,"

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and then he wrote down "$12,000."

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
"That's your salary.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
So who's the man now?" he asked them.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
"Who's the damn man?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
She's the man now."

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And that really sent a shudder through the room.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
because I think it can be pretty painful,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and we really have to work through it.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And the other reason it's kind of urgent

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
is because it's not just happening in the U.S.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
It's happening all over the world.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
In India, poor women are learning English

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
faster than their male counterparts

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
in order to staff the new call centers

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that are growing in India.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
is happening because women are starting businesses,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
small businesses, faster than men.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
Over several decades,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.260
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
in the civil code.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And if women failed to birth male children,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
they were basically treated like domestic servants.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
so they could have a male child.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
But over the '70s and '80s,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
and so what they did was,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
they started to push women into the workforce.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Now they've been asking a question since 1985:

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
And now look at the chart.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
That's from 1985 to 2003.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
How much do you prefer a first-born son?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
So you can see that these economic changes

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
really do have a strong effect on our culture.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Now because we haven't fully processed this information,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
And so we have on the male side

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
who are the males who are romantically challenged losers

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
who can't find a job.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And they come up in lots of different forms.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
So we have the perpetual adolescent.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
We have the charmless misanthrope.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Then we have our Bud Light guy

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
who's the happy couch potato.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
the sexiest man alive

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
gets romantically played these days in a movie.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
And then on the female side, you have the opposite,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
in which you have these crazy superhero women.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
You've got Lady Gaga.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And it's not just for the young, right?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And so it feels like we have to move from this place

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
where we've got these uber-exaggerated images

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
into something that feels a little more normal.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
So for a long time in the economic sphere,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
Now I've never really liked this term.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
For one thing, it puts men and women

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
because the men are these devious tricksters up there

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
who've put up this glass ceiling.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
And we have a lot of skill and experience,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
to get through that glass ceiling?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
What crazy person

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
would pop their head through a glass ceiling?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
So the image that I like to think of,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
instead of glass ceiling,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
is the high bridge.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
but it's also pretty exhilarating,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
because it's beautiful up there,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and you're looking out on a beautiful view.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
There's no man or woman standing in the middle

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
about to cut the cables.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
You can bring your husband along.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
or your babysitter to walk along with you.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
But the point about the high bridge

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
is that you have to have the confidence

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
that you have all the skills and experience you need

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
in order to walk across the high bridge,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
but you just have to make the decision

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
