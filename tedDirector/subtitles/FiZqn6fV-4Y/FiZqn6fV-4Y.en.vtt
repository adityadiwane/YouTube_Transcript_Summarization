00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.404
What is the intersection
between technology, art and science?

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.875
Curiosity and wonder,

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.622
because it drives us to explore,

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:26.272
because we're surrounded
by things we can't see.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.036
And I love to use film
to take us on a journey

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.916
through portals of time and space,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.554
to make the invisible visible,

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:36.940
because what that does,

00:00:36.964 --> 00:00:38.863
it expands our horizons,

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:41.547
it transforms our perception,

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.654
it opens our minds

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:44.975
and it touches our heart.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:48.743
So here are some scenes
from my 3D IMAX film,

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.591
"Mysteries of the Unseen World."

00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:53.775
(Music)

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.229
There is movement which is too slow
for our eyes to detect,

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:01.380
and time lapse makes us discover

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:03.766
and broaden our perspective of life.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.288
We can see how organisms emerge and grow,

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:11.677
how a vine survives by creeping
from the forest floor

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.284
to look at the sunlight.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.779
And at the grand scale,

00:01:17.803 --> 00:01:20.884
time lapse allows us to see
our planet in motion.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.700
We can view not only
the vast sweep of nature,

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:27.946
but the restless movement of humanity.

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:32.626
Each streaking dot
represents a passenger plane,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.191
and by turning air traffic data
into time-lapse imagery,

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:38.536
we can see something
that's above us constantly

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.277
but invisible:

00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:43.594
the vast network of air travel
over the United States.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.251
We can do the same thing
with ships at sea.

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:53.598
We can turn data into a time-lapse view
of a global economy in motion.

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:05.340
And decades of data give us
the view of our entire planet

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.569
as a single organism

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.831
sustained by currents circulating
throughout the oceans

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:14.952
and by clouds swirling
through the atmosphere,

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:16.825
pulsing with lightning,

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.675
crowned by the aurora Borealis.

00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:22.157
It may be the ultimate time-lapse image:

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.195
the anatomy of Earth brought to life.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.265
At the other extreme,

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.678
there are things that move
too fast for our eyes,

00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:39.965
but we have technology
that can look into that world as well.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:44.906
With high-speed cameras,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.961
we can do the opposite of time lapse.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:48.306
We can shoot images

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.779
that are thousands of times
faster than our vision.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.961
And we can see how nature's
ingenious devices work,

00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:59.143
and perhaps we can even imitate them.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.641
When a dragonfly flutters by,

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:06.700
you may not realize,

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:08.923
but it's the greatest flier in nature.

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:11.439
It can hover, fly backwards,

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.541
even upside down.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:19.553
And by tracking markers
on an insect's wings,

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:22.247
we can visualize the air flow
that they produce.

00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:24.667
Nobody knew the secret,

00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:27.300
but high speed shows that a dragonfly

00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:29.808
can move all four wings
in different directions

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:31.109
at the same time.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.268
And what we learn can lead us
to new kinds of robotic flyers

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:37.086
that can expand our vision

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.137
of important and remote places.

00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:45.663
We're giants,

00:03:45.687 --> 00:03:48.722
and we're unaware of things
that are too small for us to see.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:53.345
The electron microscope
fires electrons which creates images

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.328
which can magnify things
by as much as a million times.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:03:59.102
This is the egg of a butterfly.

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.520
And there are unseen creatures
living all over your body,

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:07.235
including mites
that spend their entire lives

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.266
dwelling on your eyelashes,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.169
crawling over your skin at night.

00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:14.423
Can you guess what this is?

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.114
Shark skin.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.355
A caterpillar's mouth.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.988
The eye of a fruit fly.

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.316
An eggshell.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.975
A flea.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.719
A snail's tongue.

00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:46.449
We think we know
most of the animal kingdom,

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:48.968
but there may be millions of tiny species

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:50.515
waiting to be discovered.

00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:57.755
A spider also has great secrets,

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.493
because spiders' silk thread
is pound for pound stronger than steel

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.000
but completely elastic.

00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:07.184
This journey will take us
all the way down to the nano world.

00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:12.101
The silk is 100 times thinner
than human hair.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.996
On there is bacteria,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.197
and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,

00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:21.351
a virus.

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.623
Inside of that, 10 times smaller,

00:05:26.647 --> 00:05:28.402
three strands of DNA.

00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:33.052
And nearing the limit
of our most powerful microscopes,

00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:35.218
single carbon atoms.

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:39.911
With the tip of a powerful microscope,

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:42.132
we can actually move atoms

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:45.062
and begin to create amazing nano devices.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:51.896
Some could one day patrol our body
for all kinds of diseases

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.655
and clean out clogged arteries
along the way.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.060
Tiny chemical machines of the future

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:01.855
can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.

00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:06.127
We are on the threshold
of extraordinary advances,

00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:09.539
born of our drive
to unveil the mysteries of life.

00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:15.458
So under an endless rain of cosmic dust,

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:17.575
the air is full of pollen,

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.235
micro-diamonds and jewels

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.842
from other planets
and supernova explosions.

00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:27.704
People go about their lives
surrounded by the unseeable.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.638
Knowing that there's so much
around us we can't see

00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:36.792
forever changes
our understanding of the world,

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:38.632
and by looking at unseen worlds,

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:41.408
we recognize that we exist
in the living universe,

00:06:41.432 --> 00:06:44.288
and this new perspective creates wonder

00:06:44.312 --> 00:06:46.891
and inspires us to become explorers

00:06:46.915 --> 00:06:48.213
in our own backyards.

00:06:50.602 --> 00:06:53.012
Who knows what awaits to be seen

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:55.583
and what new wonders
will transform our lives.

00:06:56.727 --> 00:06:58.172
We'll just have to see.

00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:06.427
(Applause)

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.625
Thank you.

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:10.720
(Applause)
