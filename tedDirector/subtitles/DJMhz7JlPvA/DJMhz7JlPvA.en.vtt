00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.611
I'm here to offer you
a new way to think about my field,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:18.403
artificial intelligence.

00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:20.441
I think the purpose of AI

00:00:20.465 --> 00:00:23.899
is to empower humans
with machine intelligence.

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:27.556
And as machines get smarter,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.833
we get smarter.

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:32.239
I call this "humanistic AI" --

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:35.934
artificial intelligence
designed to meet human needs

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.889
by collaborating and augmenting people.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.879
Now, today I'm happy to see

00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:44.080
that the idea of an intelligent assistant

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:45.573
is mainstream.

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:50.657
It's the well-accepted metaphor
for the interface between humans and AI.

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:54.073
And the one I helped create
is called Siri.

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:55.929
You know Siri.

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:58.598
Siri is the thing that knows your intent

00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:00.664
and helps you do it for you,

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:02.189
helps you get things done.

00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:04.687
But what you might not know
is that we designed Siri

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.431
as humanistic AI,

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:10.626
to augment people
with a conversational interface

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.103
that made it possible for them
to use mobile computing,

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:17.411
regardless of who they were
and their abilities.

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:20.211
Now for most of us,

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:23.016
the impact of this technology

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.323
is to make things
a little bit easier to use.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:27.915
But for my friend Daniel,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:32.343
the impact of the AI
in these systems is a life changer.

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:37.870
You see, Daniel is a really social guy,

00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:39.653
and he's blind and quadriplegic,

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:44.293
which makes it hard to use those devices
that we all take for granted.

00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.759
The last time I was at his house,
his brother said,

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:48.641
"Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.007
He's on the phone with a woman
he met online."

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.080
I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?"

00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:57.598
Well, Daniel uses Siri
to manage his own social life --

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.491
his email, text and phone --

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.991
without depending on his caregivers.

00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.059
This is kind of interesting, right?

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.400
The irony here is great.

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:10.320
Here's the man whose relationship with AI

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:13.521
helps him have relationships
with genuine human beings.

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.755
And this is humanistic AI.

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:21.622
Another example with
life-changing consequences

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:22.903
is diagnosing cancer.

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:26.770
When a doctor suspects cancer,

00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:29.497
they take a sample
and send it to a pathologist,

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.473
who looks at it under a microscope.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:34.490
Now, pathologists look at
hundreds of slides

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.838
and millions of cells every day.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.837
So to support this task,

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:42.303
some researchers made an AI classifier.

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:47.921
Now, the classifier says,
"Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:49.250
looking at the pictures.

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:51.739
The classifier was pretty good,

00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:54.472
but not as good as the person,

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.533
who got it right most of the time.

00:02:58.247 --> 00:03:04.427
But when they combine the ability
of the machine and the human together,

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.446
accuracy went to 99.5 percent.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.971
Adding that AI to a partnership
eliminated 85 percent of the errors

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:17.681
that the human pathologist
would have made working alone.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.799
That's a lot of cancer
that would have otherwise gone untreated.

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:24.847
Now, for the curious, it turns out

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.345
that the human was better
at rejecting false positives,

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.941
and the machine was better
at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.202
But the lesson here isn't about
which agent is better

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:37.304
at this image-classification task.

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:39.547
Those things are changing every day.

00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:41.139
The lesson here

00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:44.523
is that by combining the abilities
of the human and machine,

00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:49.498
it created a partnership
that had superhuman performance.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:53.303
And that is humanistic AI.

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:56.593
Now let's look at another example

00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:58.904
with turbocharging performance.

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:00.331
This is design.

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:02.396
Now, let's say you're an engineer.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.537
You want to design
a new frame for a drone.

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.625
You get out your favorite
software tools, CAD tools,

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.864
and you enter the form and the materials,
and then you analyze performance.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:13.232
That gives you one design.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:17.659
If you give those same tools to an AI,

00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:20.807
it can generate thousands of designs.

00:04:22.013 --> 00:04:23.947
This video by Autodesk is amazing.

00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:25.271
This is real stuff.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:28.983
So this transforms how we do design.

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:30.435
The human engineer now

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.774
says what the design should achieve,

00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:34.954
and the machine says,

00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:36.348
"Here's the possibilities."

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:40.518
Now in her job, the engineer's job

00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:43.642
is to pick the one that best meets
the goals of the design,

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.005
which she knows as a human
better than anyone else,

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.823
using human judgment and expertise.

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:50.814
In this case, the winning form

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:53.549
looks kind of like something
nature would have designed,

00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:55.688
minus a few million years of evolution

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.093
and all that unnecessary fur.

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:04.916
Now let's see where this idea
of humanistic AI might lead us

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.333
if we follow it into
the speculative beyond.

00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:10.942
What's a kind of augmentation
that we would all like to have?

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.255
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.203
Instead of asking,

00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.288
"How smart can we make our machines?"

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:20.485
let's ask

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.214
"How smart can our machines make us?"

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.705
I mean, take memory for example.

00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:30.277
Memory is the foundation
of human intelligence.

00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:34.558
But human memory is famously flawed.

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:37.435
We're great at telling stories,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:39.410
but not getting the details right.

00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:42.640
And our memories -- they decay over time.

00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:45.896
I mean, like, where did the '60s go,
and can I go there, too?

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.387
(Laughter)

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:52.772
But what if you could have a memory
that was as good as computer memory,

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.837
and was about your life?

00:05:57.534 --> 00:06:00.323
What if you could remember
every person you ever met,

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:02.293
how to pronounce their name,

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.409
their family details,
their favorite sports,

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:06.396
the last conversation you had with them?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.075
If you had this memory all your life,

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.397
you could have the AI look
at all the interactions

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:13.838
you had with people over time

00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:17.655
and help you reflect on the long arc
of your relationships.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.416
What if you could have the AI read
everything you've ever read

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.954
and listen to every song
you've ever heard?

00:06:27.164 --> 00:06:30.903
From the tiniest clue,
it could help you retrieve

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:33.040
anything you've ever seen or heard before.

00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:37.001
Imagine what that would do
for the ability to make new connections

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:38.605
and form new ideas.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.617
And what about our bodies?

00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:45.830
What if we could remember the consequences
of every food we eat,

00:06:45.854 --> 00:06:47.355
every pill we take,

00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:50.140
every all-nighter we pull?

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:53.578
We could do our own science
on our own data

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.462
about what makes us feel
good and stay healthy.

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:59.962
And imagine how this could revolutionize

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.676
the way we manage
allergies and chronic disease.

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.703
I believe that AI will make
personal memory enhancement a reality.

00:07:10.942 --> 00:07:13.766
I can't say when or what
form factors are involved,

00:07:14.447 --> 00:07:16.410
but I think it's inevitable,

00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:22.570
because the very things
that make AI successful today --

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:25.087
the availability of comprehensive data

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.659
and the ability for machines
to make sense of that data --

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:31.742
can be applied to the data of our lives.

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:35.812
And those data are here today,
available for all of us,

00:07:35.836 --> 00:07:39.704
because we lead digitally mediated lives,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.525
in mobile and online.

00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:47.543
In my view, a personal memory
is a private memory.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:51.504
We get to choose what is and is not
recalled and retained.

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:56.001
It's absolutely essential
that this be kept very secure.

00:07:57.114 --> 00:07:58.576
Now for most of us,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.493
the impact of augmented personal memory

00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:04.252
will be a more improved mental gain,

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:06.731
maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.

00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:13.125
But for the millions who suffer
from Alzheimer's and dementia,

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.232
the difference that augmented
memory could make

00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:19.717
is a difference
between a life of isolation

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:22.615
and a life of dignity and connection.

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:29.633
We are in the middle of a renaissance
in artificial intelligence right now.

00:08:30.472 --> 00:08:32.443
I mean, in just the past few years,

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:36.098
we're beginning to see
solutions to AI problems

00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:40.092
that we have struggled
with literally for decades:

00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:43.713
speech understanding, text understanding,

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:45.057
image understanding.

00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:50.072
We have a choice in how we use
this powerful technology.

00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:55.952
We can choose to use AI
to automate and compete with us,

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:59.953
or we can use AI to augment
and collaborate with us,

00:08:59.977 --> 00:09:03.048
to overcome our cognitive limitations

00:09:03.072 --> 00:09:06.234
and to help us do what we want to do,

00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:07.549
only better.

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:14.663
And as we discover new ways
to give machines intelligence,

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.756
we can distribute that intelligence

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.161
to all of the AI assistants in the world,

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:23.719
and therefore to every person,
regardless of circumstance.

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:26.538
And that is why,

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:29.723
every time a machine gets smarter,

00:09:30.448 --> 00:09:31.852
we get smarter.

00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:36.581
That is an AI worth spreading.

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:37.787
Thank you.

00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:41.784
(Applause)
