00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.014
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to explain to you

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.066
an extreme green concept

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.058
that was developed
at NASA's Glenn Research Center

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:22.060
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.490
But before I do that, we have to go over

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.027
the definition of what green is,

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.024
'cause a lot of us have a
different definition of it.

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.017
Green. The product is created through

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:33.480
environmentally and socially
conscious means.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.668
There's plenty of things that
are being called green now.

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:38.280
What does it actually mean?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.923
We use three metrics to determine green.

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:45.015
The first metric is: Is it sustainable?

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:48.539
Which means, are you preserving
what you are doing for future use

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.034
or for future generations?

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:55.007
Is it alternative? Is it different
than what is being used today,

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.812
or does it have a lower carbon footprint

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:00.396
than what's used conventionally?

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:03.231
And three: Is it renewable?

00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:06.987
Does it come from Earth's
natural replenishing resources,

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:10.087
such as sun, wind and water?

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:13.619
Now, my task at NASA is to develop

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.815
the next generation of aviation fuels.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.644
Extreme green. Why aviation?

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:23.001
The field of aviation uses
more fuel than just about

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:28.017
every other combined. We
need to find an alternative.

00:01:28.017 --> 00:01:31.017
Also it's a national
aeronautics directive.

00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:33.685
One of the national aeronautics
goals is to develop

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:36.381
the next generation of fuels, biofuels,

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:40.091
using domestic and safe,
friendly resources.

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:42.959
Now, combating that challenge

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.849
we have to also meet
the big three metric —

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.662
Actually, extreme green
for us is all three together;

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:52.052
that's why you see the plus
there. I was told to say that.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:57.049
So it has to be the big three at
GRC. That's another metric.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.000
Ninety-seven percent of the
world's water is saltwater.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.010
How about we use that?
Combine that with number three.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.042
Do not use arable land.

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:12.222
Because crops are already
growing on that land

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:15.019
that's very scarce around the world.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.026
Number two: Don't compete with food crops.

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:22.443
That's already a well established
entity, they don't need another entry.

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:26.391
And lastly the most precious
resource we have on this Earth

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:31.051
is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.022
If 97.5 percent
of the world's water is saltwater,

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:37.299
2.5 percent is fresh water.
Less than a half percent

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.060
of that is accessible for human use.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.021
But 60 percent of the population
lives within that one percent.

00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:48.013
So, combating my problem was,
now I have to be extreme green

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:50.261
and meet the big three.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:54.007
welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.942
This is a facility dedicated
to the next generation

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:00.087
of aviation fuels using halophytes.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:03.065
A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:07.093
Most plants don't like salt,
but halophytes tolerate salt.

00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:10.088
We also are using weeds

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:13.019
and we are also using algae.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.010
The good thing about our lab is, we've had

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.020
3,600 visitors in the last two years.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.022
Why do you think that's so?

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:24.028
Because we are on to something special.

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:26.597
So, in the lower you see
the GreenLab obviously,

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.049
and on the right hand
side you'll see algae.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.002
If you are into the business
of the next generation

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.322
of aviation fuels, algae
is a viable option,

00:03:34.322 --> 00:03:36.001
there's a lot of funding right now,

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.022
and we have an algae to fuels program.

00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:40.022
There's two types of algae growing.

00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:43.015
One is a closed photobioreactor
that you see here,

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.036
and what you see on the other
side is our species —

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:51.006
we are currently using a species
called Scenedesmus dimorphus.

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:55.312
Our job at NASA is to take the
experimental and computational

00:03:55.312 --> 00:04:00.007
and make a better mixing for
the closed photobioreactors.

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.044
Now the problems with closed
photobioreactors are:

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:04.775
They are quite expensive,
they are automated,

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.803
and it's very difficult
to get them in large scale.

00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:09.428
So on large scale what do they use?

00:04:09.428 --> 00:04:12.921
We use open pond systems.
Now, around the world

00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:16.442
they are growing algae,
with this racetrack design

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:18.891
that you see here. Looks like an oval with

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:21.028
a paddle wheel and mixes really well,

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:25.086
but when it gets around the last turn,
which I call turn four — it's stagnant.

00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:27.076
We actually have a solution for that.

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:30.040
In the GreenLab in our open pond system

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.055
we use something that happens
in nature: waves.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:36.747
We actually use wave technology
on our open pond systems.

00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:41.431
We have 95 percent mixing
and our lipid content is higher

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.049
than a closed photobioreactor system,

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.030
which we think is significant.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.062
There is a drawback to algae,
however: It's very expensive.

00:04:50.062 --> 00:04:55.165
Is there a way to produce
algae inexpensively?

00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:57.026
And the answer is: yes.

00:04:57.026 --> 00:05:00.049
We do the same thing
we do with halophytes,

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:04.004
and that is: climatic adaptation.

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.816
In our GreenLab we have
six primary ecosystems

00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:10.787
that range from freshwater
all the way to saltwater.

00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:14.546
What we do: We take a potential
species, we start at freshwater,

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:17.274
we add a little bit more salt,
when the second tank here

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:19.406
will be the same ecosystem as Brazil —

00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:22.502
right next to the sugar cane
fields you can have our plants —

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:26.745
the next tank represents Africa,
the next tank represents Arizona,

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:29.056
the next tank represents Florida,

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:32.919
and the next tank represents
California or the open ocean.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.014
What we are trying to do is to
come up with a single species

00:05:37.014 --> 00:05:43.019
that can survive anywhere in the
world, where there's barren desert.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.057
We are being very successful so far.

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:47.701
Now, here's one of the problems.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:53.428
If you are a farmer, you need five things
to be successful: You need seeds,

00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:57.043
you need soil, you need
water and you need sun,

00:05:57.043 --> 00:06:00.613
and the last thing that you
need is fertilizer.

00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:04.168
Most people use chemical fertilizers.
But guess what?

00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:06.868
We do not use chemical fertilizer.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:12.023
Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery
in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.

00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:16.228
Believe it or not, in our analysis
of our saltwater ecosystems

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:20.028
80 percent of what we need
are in these tanks themselves.

00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:24.027
The 20 percent that's missing
is nitrogen and phosphorous.

00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:26.083
We have a natural solution: fish.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:29.971
No we don't cut up the fish
and put them in there.

00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:33.854
Fish waste is what we use.
As a matter of fact

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:38.019
we use freshwater mollies, that we've
used our climatic adaptation technique

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.041
from freshwater all the way to seawater.

00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:48.037
Freshwater mollies: cheap,
they love to make babies,

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:49.846
and they love to go to the bathroom.

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:52.001
And the more they go to the
bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,

00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:54.540
the better off we are, believe it or not.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.805
It should be noted that we use
sand as our soil,

00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:04.030
regular beach sand. Fossilized coral.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.001
So a lot of people ask me,
"How did you get started?"

00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:13.006
Well, we got started in what we
call the indoor biofuels lab.

00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:17.401
It's a seedling lab. We have 26
different species of halophytes,

00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:20.684
and five are winners. What we do here is —

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:23.509
actually it should be called
a death lab, 'cause we try to

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:26.098
kill the seedlings, make them rough —

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:28.418
and then we come to the GreenLab.

00:07:28.418 --> 00:07:30.176
What you see in the lower corner

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:32.364
is a wastewater treatment plant experiment

00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:36.057
that we are growing, a macro-algae
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:40.043
And lastly, it's me actually working
in the lab to prove to you I do work,

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.775
I don't just talk about what I do.

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:47.005
Here's the plant species.
Salicornia virginica.

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:50.564
It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.

00:07:50.564 --> 00:07:54.030
Everywhere we go we see it. It's
all over the place, from Maine

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.041
all the way to California.
We love that plant.

00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:02.006
Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very
difficult to get around the world.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:04.052
It is the highest lipid
content that we have,

00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:08.042
but it has a shortcoming: It's short.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:13.163
Now you take europaea, which is the
largest or the tallest plant that we have.

00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:15.081
And what we are trying to do

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.462
with natural selection or adaptive
biology — combine all three

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:23.578
to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.

00:08:23.578 --> 00:08:30.842
Next, when a hurricane decimated the
Delaware Bay — soybean fields gone —

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:33.706
we came up with an idea:
Can you have a plant

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:39.017
that has a land reclamation positive
in Delaware? And the answer is yes.

00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:42.991
It's called seashore mallow.
Kosteletzkya virginica —

00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:46.009
say that five times fast if you can.

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:53.597
This is a 100 percent usable plant. The
seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.

00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:57.036
It's there for 10 years;
it's working very well.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.363
Now we get to Chaetomorpha.

00:09:00.363 --> 00:09:03.585
This is a macro-algae that loves

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.007
excess nutrients. If you
are in the aquarium industry

00:09:06.007 --> 00:09:08.818
you know we use it
to clean up dirty tanks.

00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:13.029
This species is so significant to us.

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:17.000
The properties are very close to plastic.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.378
We are trying right now to convert
this macro-algae into a bioplastic.

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:27.051
If we are successful, we will
revolutionize the plastics industry.

00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:30.573
So, we have a seed to fuel program.

00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:33.530
We have to do something with
this biomass that we have.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:38.039
And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid
optimization, so on and so forth,

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:41.726
because our goal really is to come up with

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:45.636
the next generation of aviation fuels,
aviation specifics, so on and so forth.

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:50.056
So far we talked about water and fuel,

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:57.000
but along the way we found out
something interesting about Salicornia:

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.686
It's a food product.

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:03.499
So we talk about ideas
worth spreading, right?

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:10.353
How about this: In sub-Saharan
Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:15.212
barren desert,
how about we take that plant,

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:20.044
plant it, half use for food,
half use for fuel.

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:23.845
We can make that happen, inexpensively.

00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:26.543
You can see
there's a greenhouse in Germany

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.007
that sells it as a health food product.

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:34.233
This is harvested, and in the middle here
is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:38.846
So I have to tell you a joke.
Salicornia is known as sea beans,

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:42.319
saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:45.050
So we are pickling pickle
weed in the middle.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.852
Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)

00:10:47.852 --> 00:10:51.225
And at the bottom is seaman's mustard.
It does make sense,

00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:53.612
this is a logical snack. You have mustard,

00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:56.760
you are a seaman, you see the
halophyte, you mix it together,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.022
it's a great snack with some crackers.

00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:06.022
And last, garlic with Salicornia,
which is what I like.

00:11:06.022 --> 00:11:10.997
So, water, fuel and food.

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:14.548
None of this is possible
without the GreenLab team.

00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:19.529
Just like the Miami Heat has the big
three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:25.008
That's myself, professor Bob Hendricks,
our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.

00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:29.537
The backbone of the GreenLab is students.

00:11:29.537 --> 00:11:33.452
Over the last two years
we've had 35 different students

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:36.607
from around the world working at GreenLab.

00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:41.016
As a matter fact my division chief says
a lot, "You have a green university."

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:43.551
I say, "I'm okay with that,
'cause we are nurturing

00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:48.575
the next generation of extreme
green thinkers, which is significant."

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:53.896
So, in first summary I presented
to you what we think

00:11:53.896 --> 00:12:00.023
is a global solution
for food, fuel and water.

00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:03.017
There's something missing to be complete.

00:12:03.017 --> 00:12:07.808
Clearly we use electricity.
We have a solution for you —

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:11.057
We're using clean energy sources here.

00:12:11.057 --> 00:12:15.478
So, we have two wind turbines
connected to the GreenLab,

00:12:15.478 --> 00:12:19.005
we have four or five more
hopefully coming soon.

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:22.615
We are also using something
that is quite interesting —

00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:27.238
there is a solar array field at
NASA's Glenn Research Center,

00:12:27.238 --> 00:12:30.380
hasn't been used for 15 years.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.143
Along with some of my electrical
engineering colleagues,

00:12:33.143 --> 00:12:35.286
we realized that they are still viable,

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:38.042
so we are refurbishing them right now.

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:43.078
In about 30 days or so they'll be
connected to the GreenLab.

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:46.004
And the reason why you see
red, red and yellow, is

00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:49.271
a lot of people think NASA employees
don't work on Saturday —

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:52.189
This is a picture taken on Saturday.

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:56.814
There are no cars around, but you see my truck
in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)

00:12:56.814 --> 00:12:58.647
This is a proof to you that I'm working.

00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:02.547
'Cause we do what it takes to get the
job done, most people know that.

00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:05.425
Here's a concept with this:

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:10.981
We are using the GreenLab
for a micro-grid test bed

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:15.044
for the smart grid concept in Ohio.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:20.951
We have the ability to do that,
and I think it's going to work.

00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:26.044
So, GreenLab Research Facility.

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:31.067
A self-sustainable renewable energy
ecosystem was presented today.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:37.014
We really, really hope this
concept catches on worldwide.

00:13:37.014 --> 00:13:46.064
We think we have a solution for food,
water, fuel and now energy. Complete.

00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:52.189
It's extreme green, it's sustainable,
alternative and renewable

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:56.027
and it meets the big three at GRC:

00:13:56.027 --> 00:14:01.018
Don't use arable land, don't
compete with food crops,

00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:04.080
and most of all, don't use fresh water.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.054
So I get a lot of questions about,
"What are you doing in that lab?"

00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:14.807
And I usually say, "None of your business,
that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)

00:14:14.807 --> 00:14:18.350
And believe it or not, my number one goal

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.060
for working on this project is

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.011
I want to help save the world.
