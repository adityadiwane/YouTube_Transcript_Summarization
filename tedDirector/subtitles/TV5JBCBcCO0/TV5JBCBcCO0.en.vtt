00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
I was thinking about my place in the universe,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
when I was a child.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And I thought that if time could reach

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
forwards and backwards infinitely,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
doesn't that mean that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
every point in time is really infinitely small,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and therefore somewhat meaningless.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
So we don't really have a place in the universe,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
as far as on a time line.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
But nothing else does either.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
that's ever happened, including this moment right now.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And so therefore this music you're about to hear

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
is maybe the most important music

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
you'll ever hear in your life.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
(Laughter)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.160
(Applause)

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
(Applause)

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
Thank you.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
(Applause)

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:37.160
(Applause)

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
you could please refrain from saying,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
(Laughter)

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
for some reason.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
(Laughter)

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Somewhat like the curving of the universe.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.160
(Laughter)

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160
(Laughter)

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
(Applause)

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
Thank you very much.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:43.160
(Applause)
