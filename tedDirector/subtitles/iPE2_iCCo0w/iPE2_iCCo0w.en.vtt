00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
and not without reason.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
I had a very charming routine at the time,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
which was to wait until late in the evening

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
scream at the top of my lungs and run out

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
because I was the Incredible Hulk.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
(Laughter)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Obviously, you see the resemblance.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
And this routine went on for some time.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
When I was seven I went to summer camp.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And at noon each day

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
the campers would go to a pond,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
where they had floating docks.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
You could jump off the end into the deep end.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
I was born premature. I was always very small.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And I've always had buoyancy problems.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
So water was something that scared me to begin with.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
But I would go in on occasion.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And on one particular day,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
So I dove through the inner tube,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And I tried to come up for air,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
That is something that I did not get over.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
My inability to swim has been

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
But there is a happy ending to this story.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
At age 31 -- that's my age now --

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
And went from swimming one lap --

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
I measured it --

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
to going to Montauk on Long Island,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
close to where I grew up,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And I came out,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
in my Speedos, European style,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
a world-class language learner,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
and a tango champion.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
And I would like to share my art.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
that really scare the living hell out of me.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So, moving onward.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Swimming, first principles.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
First principles, this is very important.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160
I find that the best results in life

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
And the turnaround in swimming came

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
So the clock started ticking.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
I started seeking out triathletes

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
I tried kickboards.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
My feet would slice through the water like razors,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Hand paddles, everything.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And he introduced me to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
So here are the new rules of swimming,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
The problem is hydrodynamics.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
So what you want to focus on instead

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
The only way you can do that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
is to not swim on top of the water.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
at least, submerged naturally.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
So you end up, number three,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
But actually rotating from streamlined right

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
to streamlined left,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And you can see that he's extending his right arm

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
below his head and far in front.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
And so his entire body really is underwater.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
The arm is extended below the head.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
The head is held in line with the spine,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
Here is an example of the stroke.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
You can see this is the left extension.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Then you see his left leg.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Small flick, and the only purpose of that

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
Rather, he is entering the water

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.160
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Not their fault, honestly.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
Below is what most swimmers

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
will find enables them to do what I did,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
to 11 strokes

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
to turn with body roll,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
And that will get you very far.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.160
That's it. That's really all you need to know.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Languages. Material versus method.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
I, like many people, came to the conclusion

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
that I was terrible at languages.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
and the sum total of my knowledge

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.160
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.160
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
all things considered.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
My first evening, before my first day of school,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
I said to my mother, very politely,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
So, (Japanese)

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
(Laughter)

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
(Laughter)

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
I walked in to school.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
because it was Kanji,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
Asked him what this said.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Traditional Japanese." And so on.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
And so it came to me in waves.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
There had been something lost in translation.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
And that's pretty much my response.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160
(Laughter)

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Nothing worked until I found this.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.160
As soon as I focused on this material,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
I took off.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.160
and have continued to apply this material

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Someone who was terrible at languages,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.160
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.160
This brings us to the point,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
You can also do this with grammar.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
will show you subject, object, verb,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
From that point, you can then, if you want to,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.160
And now I love languages.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
very important.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
But no, you'd be wrong

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And so I ended up walking like this.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.160
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
Not very good for ballroom dancing.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
I found myself in Argentina in 2005,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Went in, paid my ten pesos,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.160
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
The instructor says, "You are participating."

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
Immediately: death sweat.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160
(Laughter)

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
that it exploded in my face,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
never to return to the ballroom dancing club.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160
"Okay, come on, grab me."

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Gorgeous assistant instructor.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And she pulled back, threw down her arms,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
(Laughter)

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
which I found encouraging.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
(Laughter)

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
"Of Mice and Men" style.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And she looked up and said,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
"Now that's better."

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
So I bought a month's worth of classes.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160
(Laughter)

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
And proceeded to look at --

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
Parkinson's Law,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.160
I got a female instructor first,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
to teach me the female role, the follow,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
along with her, of the

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
I compared the two lists,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.160
and what you find is that there is explicitly,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
expertise they recommended, certain training methods.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Then there were implicit commonalities

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.160
that none of them seemed to be practicing.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.160
the tango dancers will use very short steps.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
So you can have --

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
and you can do it in a very small space in fact.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
Secondly, different types of pivots.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
Thirdly, variation in tempo.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.160
That photo is of the

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Then one month later, went to the world championships,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
two weeks later.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
I want you to see part of what I practiced.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
I'm going to jump forward here.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.160
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
His name is Gabriel Misse.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
and his pivots.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
Now what I like about this video

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.160
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
the strength in my feet, to do that.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
So he uses a lead that focuses on

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
his shoulder girdle and his arm.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
That's just one benefit of that.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.160
So then we broke it down.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
This would be an example of one pivot.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
This is a back step pivot.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
There are many different types.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
I have hundreds of hours of footage --

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
all categorized, much like George Carlin

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
categorized his comedy.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
So using my arch-nemesis,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
And the best results that I've had in life,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
what's the worst that can happen?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.160
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Take the analytical frameworks,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160
the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Apply them to very big dreams.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
When I imagine my life,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
what my life would have been like

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.160
without the educational opportunities that I had,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
it makes me wonder.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
the American public school system,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
to either fix it or replace it.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
my readers, at this point.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
And if any of you are interested in that,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
I would love to speak with you.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
Thank you very much.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
(Applause)
