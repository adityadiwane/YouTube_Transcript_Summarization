00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:14.361
Africa is booming.

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.866
Per capita incomes since the year 2000

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.466
have doubled,

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.841
and this boom is impacting on everyone.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.667
Life expectancy has increased by one year

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.417
every three years for the last decade.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:30.902
That means if an African child is born today,

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:32.690
rather than three days ago,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.577
they will get an extra day of life

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:36.600
at the end of their lifespan.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.391
It's that quick.

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:42.503
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:46.753
600,000 less people a year are getting HIV

00:00:46.753 --> 00:00:49.217
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:52.279
The battle against malaria is being won,

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:55.079
with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.841
according to the latest World Bank data.

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.938
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:02.110
This shouldn't surprise us,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.859
because actually, everybody grows.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:06.835
If you go back to Imperial Rome

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:09.040
in the Year 1 A.D.,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.338
there was admittedly about 1,800 years

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.585
where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:15.577
But then the people that the Romans

00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:19.392
would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:21.512
were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:24.200
and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.240
and you saw that get quicker and quicker,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.000
and it's been impacting everyone.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.615
It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.865
or the tundra of northern Finland.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:37.786
Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:40.120
the inevitable happens.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.741
Among the reasons I think it's happening right now

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.223
is the quality of the leadership across Africa.

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.541
I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:53.237
the greatest politician in the world was African,

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:55.848
but I'm meeting brilliant people

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.712
across the continent the entire time,

00:01:57.712 --> 00:01:59.280
and they're doing the reforms

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.792
which have transformed the economic situation

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.573
for their countries.

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:05.675
And the West is engaging with that.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.994
The West has given debt forgiveness programs

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.497
which have halved sub-Saharan debt

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:14.215
from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:16.904
At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:18.992
and we're all feeling slightly miserable

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:20.325
as a result.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:23.440
Politics gets weaker when debt is high.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.403
When public sector debt is low,

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:26.875
governments don't have to choose

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:29.357
between investing in education and health

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.632
and paying interest on that debt you owe.

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:34.854
And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.711
The private sector as well.

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.872
Again, in the West, we have private sector debt

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:42.127
of 200 percent of GDP in Spain,

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.418
the U.K., and the U.S.

00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:46.493
That's an awful lot of debt.

00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.084
Africa, many African countries,

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:52.570
are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.122
If there's any continent that can do what China has done --

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:59.539
China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.687
if anyone can do what China has done

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:03.816
in the last 30 years,

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.410
it'll be Africa in the next 30.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.132
So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:11.716
Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:13.530
Foreign direct investment

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.208
has poured into Africa in the last 15 years.

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:19.260
Back in the '70s,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.257
no one touched the continent with a barge pole.

00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:24.528
And this investment is actually Western-led.

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:26.369
We hear a lot about China,

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.689
and they do lend a lot of money,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.264
but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:34.330
has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.936
Ten percent's come from India.

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.166
And they're investing in energy.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.416
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:45.720
It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.791
And they're investing in telecoms,

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.796
shopping malls.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:53.038
And this very encouraging story, I think,

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:54.913
is partly demographic-led.

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:58.250
And it's not just about African demographics.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.225
I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:03.507
in various parts of the world,

00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:06.898
and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.

00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:09.353
Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:12.068
setting up an iPhone factory, by chance.

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:13.688
You might choose China,

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:15.890
which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.834
where there's 200 million young people,

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:22.679
and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.983
Which means you're going to have new guys

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.345
knocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"

00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:30.580
and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.168
Now, that's completely changed now.

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:36.312
This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent

00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:40.423
fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.

00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.624
So where do you set up your new factory?

00:04:43.624 --> 00:04:45.411
You look at South Asia, and people are.

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.466
They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.857
and they're also looking at Africa.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:51.648
And they're looking at Africa

00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:54.162
because that yellow line is showing you

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:55.822
that the number of young Africans

00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:57.413
is going to continue to get bigger

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:02.832
decade after decade after decade out to 2050.

00:05:02.832 --> 00:05:05.696
Now, there's a problem with lots of young people

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:07.646
coming into any market,

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:09.190
particularly when they're young men.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.516
A bit dangerous, sometimes.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:13.474
I think one of the crucial factors

00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:16.895
is how educated is that demographic?

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.827
If you look at the red line here,

00:05:18.827 --> 00:05:20.503
what you're going to see is that in 1975,

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.592
just nine percent of kids

00:05:22.592 --> 00:05:24.992
were in secondary school education

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:27.650
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.417
Would you set up a factory

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:31.307
in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:32.627
Nobody else did.

00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:35.280
They chose instead Turkey and Mexico

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.776
to set up the textiles factories,

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.234
because their education levels

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:42.135
were 25 to 30 percent.

00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:45.596
Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:49.332
that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:52.511
They will get the textiles jobs

00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:55.191
that will take people out of rural poverty

00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:59.855
and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:02.914
So what's Africa looking like today?

00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:04.575
This is how I look at Africa.

00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:06.399
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.310
Each little box is about a billion dollars,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.027
and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention

00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:12.319
to Nigeria sitting there in the middle.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.484
South Africa is playing a role.

00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:16.563
But when I'm thinking about the future,

00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:19.114
I'm actually most interested

00:06:19.114 --> 00:06:21.879
in Central, Western and Southern Africa.

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.441
If I look at Africa by population,

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.810
East Africa stands out

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.794
as so much potential.

00:06:27.794 --> 00:06:30.826
And I'm showing you something else with these maps.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:33.568
I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.

00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:36.821
Fragile democracies is the beige color.

00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:39.464
Strong democracies are the orange color.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:42.194
And what you'll see here is that most Africans

00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:46.013
are now living in democracies.

00:06:46.013 --> 00:06:48.189
Why does that matter?

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.623
Because what people want

00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:52.758
is what politicians try,

00:06:52.758 --> 00:06:55.849
they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.496
And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.372
In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,

00:07:01.372 --> 00:07:03.602
the battle between the two candidates

00:07:03.602 --> 00:07:06.875
was over education.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.868
One guy offered free secondary school education

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:11.216
to all, not just 30 percent.

00:07:11.216 --> 00:07:12.535
The other guy had to say,

00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:14.662
I'm going to build 50 new schools.

00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:17.521
He won by a margin.

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:20.571
So democracy is encouraging governments

00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.171
to invest in education.

00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:24.256
Education is helping growth and investment,

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:25.668
and that's giving budget revenues,

00:07:25.668 --> 00:07:27.507
which is giving governments more money,

00:07:27.507 --> 00:07:30.713
which is helping growth through education.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.248
It's a positive, virtuous circle.

00:07:33.248 --> 00:07:35.809
But I get asked this question,

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.895
and this particular question makes me quite sad:

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:41.426
It's, "But what about corruption?

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:45.530
How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.171
And what makes me sad about it

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:49.196
is that this graph here is showing you

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:53.161
that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.

00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:57.707
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.

00:07:57.707 --> 00:07:59.820
And the countries on the right hand side,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.543
you'll see the per capita GDP,

00:08:01.543 --> 00:08:03.368
basically every country

00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:06.863
with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:09.083
has got a corruption score

00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:12.118
of roughly, what's that, about three?

00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:14.401
Three out of 10. That's not good.

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:16.749
Every poor country is corrupt.

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:20.891
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:24.894
How do you get from poverty and corruption

00:08:24.894 --> 00:08:27.163
to wealth and less corruption?

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:29.355
You see the middle class grow.

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:32.842
And the way to do that is to invest,

00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:36.222
not to say I'm not investing in that continent

00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:38.499
because there's too much corruption.

00:08:38.499 --> 00:08:41.176
Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.

00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:44.115
I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --

00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:46.227
not in Africa, actually.

00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:47.925
But what I'm saying here is that

00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:49.715
we can make a difference

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:52.621
and we can do that by investing.

00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:56.128
Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.

00:08:56.128 --> 00:08:58.995
Economists aren't great at forecasting.

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:01.107
Because the question really is, what happens next?

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.631
And if you go back to the year 2000,

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.394
what you'll find is The Economist

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:08.562
had a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"

00:09:08.562 --> 00:09:10.744
and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth

00:09:10.744 --> 00:09:14.874
in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:16.978
and they said,

00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:19.511
what's going to happen in the next 10 years?

00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:21.890
They assumed two percent,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.783
and that made it a pretty hopeless story,

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:26.933
because population growth was two and a half.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.713
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.

00:09:29.713 --> 00:09:33.151
Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,

00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:34.997
and what does that new cover show?

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:37.980
That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.707
because the growth over the last 10 years

00:09:39.707 --> 00:09:42.327
has been about five and a half percent.

00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:45.853
I would like to see if you can all now become economists,

00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:48.368
because if growth for the last 10 years

00:09:48.368 --> 00:09:50.488
has been five and a half percent,

00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:52.191
what do you think the IMF is forecasting

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:55.211
for the next five years of growth in Africa?

00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.986
Very good. I think you're secretly saying

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:00.168
to your head, probably five and a half percent.

00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:02.110
You're all economists, and I think,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.592
like most economists, wrong.

00:10:04.592 --> 00:10:06.688
No offense.

00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.569
What I like to do is try and find the countries

00:10:09.569 --> 00:10:13.730
that are doing exactly what Africa has already done,

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.128
and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:20.175
to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.

00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:22.829
India is one of those examples.

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.948
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.

00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:29.862
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:32.232
Actually, for the first 20 years,

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:35.275
the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.

00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:37.336
It grew at two percent

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:40.416
when population growth was about two and a half.

00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.596
If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened

00:10:42.596 --> 00:10:44.891
in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.

00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:46.665
And then something happened in 1980.

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:48.888
Boom! India began to explode.

00:10:48.888 --> 00:10:51.172
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,"

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:54.228
"democracies can't grow." Actually India could.

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:57.034
And if I lay sub-Saharan growth

00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:59.302
on top of the Indian growth story,

00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:01.918
it's remarkably similar.

00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:04.205
Twenty years of not much growth

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.759
and a trend line which is actually telling you

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.749
that sub-Saharan African growth is

00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:10.310
slightly better than India.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.745
And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,

00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:16.569
I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:20.675
I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:22.852
I can draw out some forecasts

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:25.172
for the next 30 to 40 years

00:11:25.172 --> 00:11:27.242
which I think are better

00:11:27.242 --> 00:11:30.094
than the ones where you're looking backwards.

00:11:30.094 --> 00:11:32.441
And that tells me this:

00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:34.223
that Africa is going to go

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:37.260
from a $2 trillion economy today

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.532
to a $29 trillion economy by 2050.

00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:43.540
Now that's bigger than Europe and America

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.998
put together in today's money.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:50.918
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:52.656
The population's going to double

00:11:52.656 --> 00:11:54.109
from one billion to two billion,

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:57.459
so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold

00:11:57.459 --> 00:12:00.323
in the next 35 years.

00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:03.440
And when I present this in Africa --

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.244
Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.

00:12:07.244 --> 00:12:12.112
"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"

00:12:12.112 --> 00:12:13.955
And you know what?

00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:16.344
Actually, I think they've got a point.

00:12:16.344 --> 00:12:18.816
Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,

00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:22.100
yes from the positives in Asia and India,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.478
but also the negatives?

00:12:23.478 --> 00:12:26.040
Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.435
Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:31.044
this last week,

00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:32.988
surely some of these can perhaps

00:12:32.988 --> 00:12:35.716
help Africa grow even faster?

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:38.151
And I think here we can play a role.

00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:40.994
Because technology does let you help.

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:43.133
You can go and download

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:45.168
some of the great African literature

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:46.967
from the Internet now.

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:49.440
No, not right now, just 30 seconds.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.630
You can go and buy some of the great tunes.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.361
My iPod's full of them.

00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:55.051
Buy African products.

00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:57.016
Go on holiday and see for yourself

00:12:57.016 --> 00:12:58.565
the change that's happening.

00:12:58.565 --> 00:12:59.970
Invest.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.096
Perhaps hire people, give them the skills

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:04.365
that they can take back to Africa,

00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:06.630
and their companies will grow an awful lot faster

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.280
than most of ours here in the West.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.581
And then you and I can help make sure

00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:17.710
that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.520
Thank you very much.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.520
(Applause)
