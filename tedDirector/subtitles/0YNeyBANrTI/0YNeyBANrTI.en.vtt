00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:18.641
I'm a designer and an educator.

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:21.537
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:27.648
to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:32.613
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:38.318
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:41.233
A couple of examples.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:42.661
Look at that.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.274
This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:49.929
So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS,

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.281
and maybe uploading some pictures

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.799
about this awesome barbecue.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.833
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.258
so this two percent of people who are able

00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:07.394
to control multitasking environment.

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:11.998
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.299
When's the last time you really enjoyed

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.569
just the voice of your friend?

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.825
So this is a project I'm working on,

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:25.869
and this is a series of front covers

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.376
to downgrade our super, hyper â€”

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:35.293
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:38.101
to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.132
into the essence of their function.

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:43.909
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.222
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:50.605
on the island.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:54.047
But our multitasking reality is pretty different,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:58.319
and full of tons of information.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.856
So what about something like that

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:05.023
to rediscover our sense of adventure?

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:08.296
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:12.847
when the number of possibilities is so huge,

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:17.446
but I push you to consider the option of

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:20.563
focusing on just one task,

00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:26.520
or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.536
So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:36.280
Why not? So find your monotask spot

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.864
within the multitasking world.

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:40.397
Thank you.

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:47.075
(Applause)
