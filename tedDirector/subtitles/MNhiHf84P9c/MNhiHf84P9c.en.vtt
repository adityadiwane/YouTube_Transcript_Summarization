00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:31.976
I got to see the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:35.103
I was in India this past year,

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:39.014
and I may have seen
the last cases of polio in the world.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.416
There's nothing that makes
you feel more --

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.983
the blessing and the honor
of working in a program like that --

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.051
than to know that something
that horrible no longer exists.

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:53.728
So I'm going to tell you --

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:56.457
(Applause)

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.886
so I'm going to show you
some dirty pictures.

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:05.664
They are difficult to watch,
but you should look at them with optimism,

00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:10.759
because the horror
of these pictures will be matched

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:14.855
by the uplifting quality of knowing
that they no longer exist.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.661
But first, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about my own journey.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.740
My background is not exactly
the conventional medical education

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.000
that you might expect.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.139
When I was an intern in San Francisco,

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:34.975
I heard about a group of Native Americans
who had taken over Alcatraz Island,

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.976
and a Native American
who wanted to give birth on that island,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.141
and no other doctor wanted
to go and help her give birth.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.762
I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived
on the island for several weeks.

00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:49.309
She gave birth; I caught
the baby; I got off the island;

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.189
I landed in San Francisco;

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:53.101
and all the press wanted to talk to me,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:57.226
because my three weeks on the island
made me an expert in Indian affairs.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.254
(Laughter)

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.317
I wound up on every television show.

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.453
Someone saw me on television;
they called me up; and they asked me

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:06.082
if I'd like to be in a movie
and to play a young doctor

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.256
for a bunch of rock and roll stars
who were traveling in a bus ride

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.354
from San Francisco to England.

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:12.976
And I said, yes, I would do that,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.256
so I became the doctor
in an absolutely awful movie

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.178
called "Medicine Ball Caravan."

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.248
(Laughter)

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:21.744
Now, you know from the '60s,

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.845
you're either on the bus
or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.866
My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.570
Our bus ride took us
from San Francisco to London,

00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:32.793
then we switched buses at the big pond.

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:36.245
We then got on two more buses

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.341
and we drove through Turkey
and Iran, Afghanistan,

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:42.976
over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,
like every other young doctor.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.667
This is us at the Khyber Pass,
and that's our bus.

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:48.346
We had some difficulty getting
over the Khyber Pass.

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.000
But we wound up in India.

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.714
And then, like everyone else
in our generation,

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:56.023
we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.

00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:58.000
(Laughter)

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.231
This is just like a residency program,

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.411
for those of you
that are in medical school.

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:05.068
(Laughter)

00:03:05.092 --> 00:03:10.292
And we studied with a wise man,
a guru named Karoli Baba,

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:13.958
who then told me to get rid of the dress,

00:03:13.982 --> 00:03:15.725
put on a three-piece suit,

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.003
go join the United Nations as a diplomat

00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:21.087
and work for the World
Health Organization.

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:25.479
And he made an outrageous prediction
that smallpox would be eradicated,

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:28.525
and that this was God's gift to humanity,

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.054
because of the hard work
of dedicated scientists.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.664
And that prediction came true.

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.814
This little girl is Rahima Banu,

00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:39.803
and she was the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:45.208
And this document is the certificate
that the global commission signed,

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:50.000
certifying the world to have eradicated
the first disease in history.

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:56.976
The key to eradicating smallpox
was early detection, early response.

00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:01.668
I'm going to ask you to repeat that:
early detection, early response.

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:02.844
Can you say that?

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:05.290
Audience: Early detection, early response.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.871
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox
was the worst disease in history.

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:11.413
It killed more people
than all the wars in history.

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:16.000
In the last century,
it killed 500 million people.

00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:19.849
You're reading about Larry Page already.

00:04:19.873 --> 00:04:21.445
Somebody reads very fast.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.023
(Laughter)

00:04:23.047 --> 00:04:25.221
In the year that Larry Page
and Sergey Brin --

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:28.861
with whom I have a certain affection
and a new affiliation --

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:31.065
in the year in which they were born,

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.210
two million people died of smallpox.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.654
We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.056
This is the most important slide
that I've ever seen in public health,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.564
[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]
because it shows you

00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:46.459
to be the richest and the strongest,

00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:48.408
and to be kings and queens of the world,

00:04:48.432 --> 00:04:50.506
did not protect you
from dying of smallpox.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.342
Never can you doubt
that we are all in this together.

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.379
But to see smallpox
from the perspective of a sovereign

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:00.903
is the wrong perspective.

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.976
You should see it
from the perspective of a mother,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.817
watching her child develop
this disease and standing by helplessly.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:13.572
Day one, day two, day three,

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:19.201
day four, day five, day six.

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:22.614
You're a mother and you're
watching your child,

00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:27.614
and on day six, you see
pustules that become hard.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.124
Day seven, they show the classic scars
of smallpox umbilication.

00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:34.458
Day eight.

00:05:34.482 --> 00:05:36.210
And Al Gore said earlier

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:39.123
that the most photographed
image in the world,

00:05:39.147 --> 00:05:40.894
the most printed image in the world,

00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:42.078
was that of the Earth.

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:45.713
But this was in 1974,
and as of that moment,

00:05:45.737 --> 00:05:49.360
this photograph was the photograph
that was the most widely printed,

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:52.869
because we printed two billion copies
of this photograph,

00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:56.047
and we took them
hand to hand, door to door,

00:05:56.071 --> 00:06:00.952
to show people and ask them
if there was smallpox in their house,

00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:03.082
because that was our surveillance system.

00:06:03.106 --> 00:06:05.661
We didn't have Google,
we didn't have web crawlers,

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:07.415
we didn't have computers.

00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:12.724
By day nine -- you look at this picture
and you're horrified;

00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:15.281
I look at this picture
and I say, "Thank God,"

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:19.266
because it's clear that this is only
an ordinary case of smallpox,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.281
and I know this child will live.

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:27.830
And by day 13, the lesions
are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:31.683
but you know this child has
no other secondary infection.

00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:36.381
And by day 20, while he will be
scarred for life, he will live.

00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:40.224
There are other kinds of smallpox
that are not like that.

00:06:40.248 --> 00:06:42.636
This is confluent smallpox,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.445
in which there isn't a single place
on the body where you could put a finger

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.278
and not be covered by lesions.

00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:53.588
Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent
of people who got it.

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:56.581
And hemorrhagic smallpox,
the most cruel of all,

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:59.873
which had a predilection
for pregnant women.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:01.864
I've probably had 50 women die.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.412
They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.

00:07:04.436 --> 00:07:07.760
I've never seen anybody die from it
who wasn't a pregnant woman.

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.379
In 1967, the WHO embarked
on what was an outrageous program

00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:13.887
to eradicate a disease.

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:17.776
In that year, there were 34 countries
affected with smallpox.

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:21.269
By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.

00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:24.460
1974, we were down to five countries.

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:29.162
But in that year,
smallpox exploded throughout India.

00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:33.976
And India was the place
where smallpox made its last stand.

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.587
In 1974, India had
a population of 600 million.

00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.629
There are 21 linguistic states in India,

00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:42.845
which is like saying
21 different countries.

00:07:43.242 --> 00:07:46.139
There are 20 million people
on the road at any time,

00:07:46.163 --> 00:07:52.182
in buses and trains, walking;
500,000 villages, 120 million households,

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:54.510
and none of them wanted to report

00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:56.976
if they had a case
of smallpox in their house,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.364
because they thought that smallpox
was the visitation of a deity,

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.411
Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:06.611
and it was wrong to bring
strangers into your house

00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:08.382
when the deity was in the house.

00:08:09.048 --> 00:08:11.297
No incentive to report smallpox.

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:14.291
It wasn't just India
that had smallpox deities;

00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:17.579
smallpox deities were
prevalent all over the world.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.412
So, how we eradicated smallpox was --

00:08:21.436 --> 00:08:23.710
mass vaccination wouldn't work.

00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:25.637
You could vaccinate everybody in India,

00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:28.161
but one year later there'd be
21 million new babies,

00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:30.280
which was then the population of Canada.

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:32.881
It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:35.976
You had to find every single
case of smallpox in the world

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.976
at the same time, and draw
a circle of immunity around it.

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:41.000
And that's what we did.

00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:47.510
In India alone, my 150,000 best friends
and I went door to door,

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:49.608
with that same picture,

00:08:49.632 --> 00:08:51.203
to every single house in India.

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:53.103
We made over one billion house calls.

00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:58.057
And in the process,
I learned something very important.

00:08:58.763 --> 00:09:03.021
Every time we did a house-to-house search,

00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:07.769
we had a spike in the number
of reports of smallpox.

00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:12.928
When we didn't search, we had
the illusion that there was no disease.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:17.156
When we did search, we had the illusion
that there was more disease.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.419
A surveillance system was necessary,

00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:25.420
because what we needed
was early detection, early response.

00:09:26.722 --> 00:09:28.921
So we searched and we searched,

00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:31.795
and we found every case
of smallpox in India.

00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:34.780
We had a reward. We raised the reward.

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:36.860
We continued to increase the reward.

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:39.697
We had a scorecard
that we wrote on every house.

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.157
And as we did that,

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.557
the number of reported cases
in the world dropped to zero.

00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:51.643
And in 1980, we declared the globe
free of smallpox.

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:56.172
It was the largest campaign
in United Nations history,

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.806
until the Iraq war.

00:09:58.657 --> 00:10:01.976
150,000 people from all over the world --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.916
doctors of every race,
religion, culture and nation,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.835
who fought side by side,
brothers and sisters,

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.097
with each other, not against each other,

00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:15.343
in a common cause
to make the world better.

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:20.044
But smallpox was the fourth disease
that was intended for eradication.

00:10:20.068 --> 00:10:22.321
We failed three other times.

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:25.624
We failed against malaria,
yellow fever and yaws.

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:28.976
But soon we may see polio eradicated.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.737
But the key to eradicating polio
is early detection, early response.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.459
This may be the year we eradicate polio.

00:10:38.483 --> 00:10:41.173
That will make it
the second disease in history.

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:45.336
And David Heymann, who's watching
this on the webcast --

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.320
David, keep on going. We're close!

00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:49.976
We're down to four countries.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.407
(Applause)

00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.646
I feel like Hank Aaron.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.673
Barry Bonds can replace me any time.

00:10:59.697 --> 00:11:03.831
Let's get another disease off the list
of terrible things to worry about.

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:08.064
I was just in India working on
the polio program.

00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:13.851
The polio surveillance program
is four million people going door to door.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.976
That is the surveillance system.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.126
But we need to have
early detection, early response.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.777
Blindness, the same thing.

00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:26.753
The key to discovering blindness
is doing epidemiological surveys

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:28.976
and finding out the causes of blindness,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.658
so you can mount the correct response.

00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:36.874
The Seva Foundation
was started by a group of alumni

00:11:36.898 --> 00:11:39.790
of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,

00:11:39.814 --> 00:11:42.505
who, having climbed the highest mountain,

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:46.976
tasted the elixir of the success
of eradicating a disease,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.976
wanted to do it again.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.868
And over the last 27 years,
Seva's programs in 15 countries

00:11:53.892 --> 00:11:56.976
have given back sight
to more than two million blind people.

00:11:57.982 --> 00:12:01.113
Seva got started because we wanted
to apply these lessons

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.732
of surveillance and epidemiology

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.681
to something which nobody else
was looking at as a public health issue:

00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:11.691
blindness, which heretofore had been
thought of only as a clinical disease.

00:12:12.834 --> 00:12:19.106
In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me
that computer, which is Apple number 12,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.583
and it's still in Kathmandu,
and it's still working,

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:25.452
and we ought to go get it and auction
it off and make more money for Seva.

00:12:26.214 --> 00:12:30.250
And we conducted the first Nepal survey
ever done for health,

00:12:30.274 --> 00:12:33.131
and the first nationwide
blindness survey ever done,

00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:34.976
and we had astonishing results.

00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:38.273
Instead of finding out
what we thought was the case --

00:12:38.297 --> 00:12:41.976
that blindness was caused mostly
by glaucoma and trachoma --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.464
we were astounded to find out

00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:48.163
that blindness was caused
instead by cataract.

00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:53.219
You can't cure or prevent
what you don't know is there.

00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:59.341
In your TED packages
there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,"

00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:01.976
about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.032
I hope that you will take a look at it.

00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:06.230
Aravind, which started as a Seva project,

00:13:06.254 --> 00:13:09.202
is now the world's largest
and best eye hospital.

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:12.623
This year, that one hospital
will give back sight

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:16.198
to more than 300,000 people
in Tamil Nadu, India.

00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:20.496
(Applause)

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.672
Bird flu.

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:24.517
I stand here as a representative
of all terrible things --

00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:26.000
this might be the worst.

00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:31.545
The key to preventing
or mitigating pandemic bird flu

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:33.976
is early detection and rapid response.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.803
We will not have a vaccine
or adequate supplies of an antiviral

00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:42.976
to combat bird flu if it occurs
in the next three years.

00:13:43.342 --> 00:13:46.976
WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:51.739
We are now at stage three
on the pandemic alert stage,

00:13:51.763 --> 00:13:55.318
with just a little bit
of human-to-human transmission,

00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:58.976
but no human-to-human-to-human
sustained transmission.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.228
The moment WHO says
we've moved to category four --

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:05.415
this will not be like Katrina.

00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:07.518
The world as we know it will stop.

00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:09.284
There'll be no airplanes flying.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.149
Would you get in an airplane
with 250 people you didn't know,

00:14:13.173 --> 00:14:14.325
coughing and sneezing,

00:14:14.349 --> 00:14:17.842
when you knew that some of them
might carry a disease that could kill you,

00:14:17.866 --> 00:14:20.746
for which you had
no antivirals or vaccine?

00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:25.894
I did a study of the top epidemiologists
in the world in October.

00:14:25.918 --> 00:14:29.976
I asked them -- these are all fluologists
and specialists in influenza --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.836
and I asked them the questions
you'd like to ask them:

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.048
What do you think the likelihood
is that there'll be a pandemic?

00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:38.749
If it happens, how bad
do you think it will be?

00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:43.713
Fifteen percent said they thought
there'd be a pandemic within three years.

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:45.673
But much worse than that,

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:49.159
90 percent said they thought
there'd be a pandemic

00:14:49.183 --> 00:14:52.104
within your children
or your grandchildren's lifetime.

00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:56.771
And they thought
that if there was a pandemic,

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:58.811
a billion people would get sick.

00:14:59.723 --> 00:15:03.152
As many as 165 million people would die.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.366
There would be a global
recession and depression

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.568
as our just-in-time inventory system

00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:12.410
and the tight rubber band
of globalization broke,

00:15:12.434 --> 00:15:16.378
and the cost to our economy
of one to three trillion dollars

00:15:16.402 --> 00:15:22.024
would be far worse for everyone
than merely 100 million people dying,

00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:24.350
because so many more people
would lose their job

00:15:24.374 --> 00:15:25.976
and their healthcare benefits,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.455
that the consequences
are almost unthinkable.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:34.000
And it's getting worse,
because travel is getting so much better.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:41.909
Let me show you a simulation
of what a pandemic looks like.

00:15:42.746 --> 00:15:44.746
So we know what we're talking about.

00:15:45.393 --> 00:15:49.000
Let's assume, for example,
that the first case occurs in South Asia.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.750
It initially goes quite slowly.

00:15:52.774 --> 00:15:55.390
You get two or three discrete locations.

00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:01.741
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,
and the disease will spread

00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:05.976
from country to country so fast
that you won't know what hit you.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.976
Within three weeks
it will be everywhere in the world.

00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:16.137
Now, if we had an "undo" button,
and we could go back and isolate it

00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:19.518
and grab it when it first started --
if we could find it early,

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.976
and we had early detection
and early response,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.690
and we could put each one
of those viruses in jail --

00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:30.595
that's the only way to deal with
something like a pandemic.

00:16:32.349 --> 00:16:34.000
And let me show you why that is.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.255
We have a joke.

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:39.103
This is an epidemic curve,
and everyone in medicine,

00:16:39.127 --> 00:16:41.550
I think, ultimately gets
to know what it is.

00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:42.728
But the joke is,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:45.861
an epidemiologist likes to arrive
at an epidemic right here

00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:48.023
and ride to glory on the downhill curve.

00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:49.150
(Laughter)

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.976
But you don't get to do that usually.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.978
You usually arrive right about here.

00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:58.809
What we really want is to arrive
right here, so we can stop the epidemic.

00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:00.756
But you can't always do that.

00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:04.749
But there's an organization
that has been able to find a way

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.976
to learn when the first cases occur,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.349
and that is called GPHIN;

00:17:09.373 --> 00:17:11.896
it's the Global Public Health
Information Network.

00:17:12.246 --> 00:17:14.334
And that simulation that I showed you

00:17:14.358 --> 00:17:16.555
that you thought
was bird flu -- that was SARS.

00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:19.763
And SARS is the pandemic
that did not occur.

00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:21.731
And it didn't occur

00:17:21.755 --> 00:17:28.066
because GPHIN found
the pandemic-to-be of SARS

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:34.128
three months before WHO actually
announced it, and because of that,

00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:37.318
we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.

00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:39.423
And I think we owe
a great debt of gratitude

00:17:39.447 --> 00:17:41.604
to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,

00:17:41.628 --> 00:17:45.079
who I hope is in the audience
some place -- over there --

00:17:45.103 --> 00:17:46.976
who's the founder of GPHIN.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.483
(Applause)

00:17:48.507 --> 00:17:49.976
Hello, Ron!

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.800
(Applause)

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.224
And TED has flown Ron here
from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:07.685
because not only
did GPHIN find SARS early,

00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.826
but you may have seen last week

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.181
that Iran announced
that they had bird flu in Iran,

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:17.897
but GPHIN found the bird flu
in Iran not February 14 --

00:18:17.921 --> 00:18:19.778
but last September.

00:18:19.802 --> 00:18:22.462
We need an early-warning system

00:18:22.486 --> 00:18:26.821
to protect us against the things
that are humanity's worst nightmare.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:31.441
And so my TED wish is based on
the common denominator

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:32.831
of these experiences.

00:18:32.855 --> 00:18:35.741
Smallpox -- early detection,
early response.

00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:38.892
Blindness, polio --
early detection, early response.

00:18:39.249 --> 00:18:43.241
Pandemic bird flu --
early detection, early response.

00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:44.652
It is a litany.

00:18:44.676 --> 00:18:49.690
It is so obvious that our only way
of dealing with these new diseases

00:18:49.714 --> 00:18:54.041
is to find them early
and to kill them before they spread.

00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:58.473
So, my TED wish is for you
to help build a global system --

00:18:58.497 --> 00:18:59.976
an early-warning system --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.731
to protect us against
humanity's worst nightmares.

00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:10.504
And what I thought I would call it
is "Early Detection,"

00:19:11.724 --> 00:19:13.848
But it should really be called ...

00:19:15.223 --> 00:19:16.872
"Total Early Detection."
[TED]

00:19:16.896 --> 00:19:17.979
(Laughter)

00:19:18.003 --> 00:19:19.154
What?

00:19:19.178 --> 00:19:26.163
(Applause)

00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:27.743
What?

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.250
(Applause)

00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:33.062
But in all seriousness,

00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:36.609
because this idea is birthed in TED,

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:41.976
I would like it to be
a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.221
the "International System for Total
Early Disease Detection."

00:19:47.245 --> 00:19:48.443
[INSTEDD]

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.386
And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.

00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:00.740
So instead of a hidden
pandemic of bird flu,

00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:02.764
we find it and immediately contain it.

00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:08.598
Instead of a novel virus
caused by bio-terror or bio-error,

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:12.609
or shift or drift,
we find it and we contain it.

00:20:13.268 --> 00:20:15.754
Instead of industrial
accidents like oil spills

00:20:15.778 --> 00:20:17.976
or the catastrophe in Bhopal,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.210
we find them, and we respond to them.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.913
Instead of famine,
hidden until it is too late,

00:20:24.937 --> 00:20:27.879
we detect it, and we respond.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:32.228
And instead of a system
which is owned by a government,

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:34.673
and hidden in the bowels of government,

00:20:34.697 --> 00:20:37.299
let's build an early detection system

00:20:37.323 --> 00:20:41.152
that's freely available to anyone
in the world in their own language.

00:20:41.858 --> 00:20:46.626
Let's make it transparent,
non-governmental,

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.706
not owned by any single
country or company,

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.150
housed in a neutral country,
with redundant backup

00:20:53.174 --> 00:20:56.341
in a different time zone
and a different continent.

00:20:57.135 --> 00:20:59.128
And let's build it on GPHIN.

00:20:59.152 --> 00:21:00.534
Let's start with GPHIN.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.964
Let's increase the websites
that they crawl

00:21:03.988 --> 00:21:05.976
from 20,000 to 20 million.

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:09.007
Let's increase the languages they crawl

00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:11.824
from seven to 70, or more.

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:15.713
Let's build in outbound
confirmation messages,

00:21:15.737 --> 00:21:19.001
using text messages or SMS
or instant messaging

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:21.835
to find out from people
who are within 100 meters

00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:23.610
of the rumor that you hear,

00:21:23.634 --> 00:21:24.976
if it is, in fact, valid.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.241
And let's add satellite confirmation.

00:21:27.614 --> 00:21:31.521
And we'll add Gapminder's
amazing graphics to the front end.

00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:35.463
And we'll grow it
as a moral force in the world,

00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:37.579
finding out those terrible things

00:21:37.603 --> 00:21:39.690
before anybody else knows about them,

00:21:39.714 --> 00:21:42.140
and sending our response to them,

00:21:42.164 --> 00:21:45.678
so that next year,
instead of us meeting here,

00:21:45.702 --> 00:21:49.256
lamenting how many terrible things
there are in the world,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.018
we will have pulled together,

00:21:51.042 --> 00:21:55.921
used the unique skills
and the magic of this community,

00:21:55.945 --> 00:21:59.367
and be proud that we have done
everything we can to stop pandemics,

00:21:59.391 --> 00:22:03.401
other catastrophes, and change
the world, beginning right now.

00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:11.480
(Applause)

00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:26.176
Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.983
First of all, just so
everyone understands:

00:22:29.007 --> 00:22:33.523
you're saying that
by creating web crawlers,

00:22:33.547 --> 00:22:36.428
looking on the Internet for patterns,

00:22:36.452 --> 00:22:40.857
they can detect something suspicious

00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:43.534
before WHO, before anyone else can see it?

00:22:44.478 --> 00:22:47.335
Give an example of how
that could possibly be true.

00:22:48.174 --> 00:22:51.111
Larry Brilliant: You're not mad
about the copyright violation?

00:22:51.135 --> 00:22:52.294
CA: No. I love it.

00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:53.520
(Laughter)

00:22:53.544 --> 00:22:55.097
LB: Well, as Ron St. John --

00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.541
I hope you'll go and meet him
in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.

00:22:58.565 --> 00:23:01.118
When he started GPHIN --

00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:05.538
In 1997, there was an outbreak
of bird flu -- H5N1.

00:23:05.562 --> 00:23:06.849
It was in Hong Kong.

00:23:06.873 --> 00:23:10.055
And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong
responded immediately,

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:14.896
by slaughtering 1.5 million
chickens and birds,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.808
and they stopped
that outbreak in its tracks.

00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:21.044
Immediate detection, immediate response.

00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:22.562
Then a number of years went by,

00:23:22.586 --> 00:23:24.870
and there were a lot
of rumors about bird flu.

00:23:25.584 --> 00:23:29.372
Ron and his team in Ottawa
began to crawl the web --

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:34.586
only crawling 20,000 different websites,
mostly periodicals --

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.833
and they read about
and heard about a concern,

00:23:37.857 --> 00:23:41.676
of a lot of children who had high fever
and symptoms of bird flu.

00:23:42.613 --> 00:23:44.514
They reported this to WHO.

00:23:45.161 --> 00:23:47.173
WHO took a little while taking action,

00:23:47.197 --> 00:23:51.856
because WHO will only receive
a report from a government,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.546
because it's the United Nations.

00:23:54.396 --> 00:23:57.798
But they were able to point
to WHO and let them know

00:23:57.822 --> 00:24:02.287
that there was this surprising
and unexplained cluster of illnesses

00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:03.715
that looked like bird flu.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.814
That turned out to be SARS.

00:24:05.838 --> 00:24:08.210
That's how the world found out about SARS.

00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:11.715
And because of that,
we were able to stop SARS.

00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:15.317
Now, what's really important is that,
before there was GPHIN,

00:24:15.341 --> 00:24:19.556
100 percent of all the world's
reports of bad things --

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.248
whether you're talking about famine

00:24:21.272 --> 00:24:24.350
or you're talking about bird flu
or you're talking about Ebola --

00:24:24.374 --> 00:24:27.113
100 percent of all those reports
came from nations.

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:29.185
The moment these guys in Ottawa --

00:24:29.209 --> 00:24:33.590
on a budget of 800,000 dollars
a year -- got cracking,

00:24:33.614 --> 00:24:37.746
75 percent of all the reports
in the world came from GPHIN,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.134
25 percent of all the reports in the world

00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:42.215
came from all the other 180 nations.

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.484
Now, here's what's really interesting:

00:24:45.508 --> 00:24:48.151
after they'd been working
for a couple years,

00:24:48.175 --> 00:24:50.273
what do you think happened
to those nations?

00:24:50.297 --> 00:24:51.480
They felt pretty stupid.

00:24:51.504 --> 00:24:53.717
So they started sending in
their reports early.

00:24:53.741 --> 00:24:57.597
And now, their reporting percentage
is down to 50 percent,

00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:00.039
because other nations
have started to report.

00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:04.229
So, can you find diseases
early by crawling the web?

00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:05.434
Of course you can.

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.673
Can you find it even earlier
than GPHIN does now?

00:25:08.697 --> 00:25:09.848
Of course you can.

00:25:09.872 --> 00:25:14.477
You saw that they found SARS
using their Chinese web crawler

00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:19.444
a full six weeks before they found it
using their English web crawler.

00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:22.182
Well, they're only crawling
in seven languages.

00:25:22.206 --> 00:25:24.712
These bad viruses really
don't have any intention

00:25:24.736 --> 00:25:27.194
of showing up first in English
or Spanish or French.

00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:29.217
(Laughter)

00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:33.725
So yes, I want to take GPHIN,
I want to build on it.

00:25:34.312 --> 00:25:37.664
I want to add all the languages
of the world that we possibly can.

00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:39.976
I want to make this open to everybody,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.976
so that the health officer
in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.294
will have as much access to it
as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.

00:25:47.724 --> 00:25:50.128
And I want to make it part of our culture

00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:53.739
that there is a community of people
who are watching out

00:25:53.763 --> 00:25:55.976
for the worst nightmares of humanity,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
and that it's accessible to everyone.
