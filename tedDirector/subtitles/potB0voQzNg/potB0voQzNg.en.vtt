00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:15.172
Bruno Giussani: Commissioner,
thank you for coming to TED.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:16.513
AntÃ³nio Guterres: Pleasure.

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.989
BG: Let's start with a figure.

00:00:18.013 --> 00:00:22.154
During 2015, almost one million refugees
and migrants arrived in Europe

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:23.653
from many different countries,

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:26.375
of course, from Syria and Iraq,
but also from Afghanistan

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.861
and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.385
And there have been reactions
of two different kinds:

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.124
welcoming parties and border fences.

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:37.205
But I want to look at it a little bit

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.059
from the short-term
and the long-term perspective.

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.575
And the first question is very simple:

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.067
Why has the movement of refugees
spiked so fast in the last six months?

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.384
AG: Well, I think, basically,
what triggered this huge increase

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:53.329
was the Syrian refugee group.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:58.089
There has been an increased movement
into Europe from Africa, from Asia,

00:00:58.113 --> 00:01:01.939
but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
we had this massive increase

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.397
in the first months of this year.

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:06.289
Why? I think there are three reasons,

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:08.346
two long-term ones and the trigger.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.918
The long-term ones,
in relation to Syrians,

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:17.549
is that hope is less and less
clear for people.

00:01:17.573 --> 00:01:19.605
I mean, they look at their own country

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.310
and they don't see much hope
to go back home,

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.279
because there is no political solution,

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:27.358
so there is no light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:29.006
Second, the living conditions

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.356
of the Syrians in the neighboring
countries have been deteriorating.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.633
We just had research with the World Bank,

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:38.993
and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:41.918
and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:44.804
live below the national poverty lines.

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:47.761
Only half of the children go to school,

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:50.807
which means that people
are living very badly.

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:52.755
Not only are they refugees, out of home,

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.231
not only have they suffered
what they have suffered,

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:57.824
but they are living in very,
very dramatic conditions.

00:01:57.848 --> 00:02:00.168
And then the trigger
was when all of a sudden,

00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:01.895
international aid decreased.

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:04.712
The World Food Programme was forced,
for lack of resources,

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:07.800
to cut by 30 percent food support
to the Syrian refugees.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:09.247
They're not allowed to work,

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:12.799
so they are totally dependent
on international support,

00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:15.127
and they felt, "The world
is abandoning us."

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.111
And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:18.770
All of a sudden, there was a rush,

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:20.809
and people started to move
in large numbers

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.391
and, to be absolutely honest,

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.614
if I had been in the same situation

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.745
and I would have been brave
enough to do it,

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.472
I think I would have done the same.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:32.761
BG: But I think what surprised
many people is it's not only sudden,

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.985
but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.422
The war in Syria has been
happening for five years.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:41.106
Millions of refugees are in camps
and villages and towns around Syria.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.510
You have yourself warned
about the situation

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:46.817
and about the consequences
of a breakdown of Libya, for example,

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:49.880
and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:53.077
AG: Well, unprepared because divided,

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.379
and when you are divided,
you don't want to recognize the reality.

00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:58.260
You prefer to postpone decisions,

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:00.720
because you do not have
the capacity to make them.

00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:04.206
And the proof is that even when
the spike occurred,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.533
Europe remained divided

00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:11.226
and was unable to put in place
a mechanism to manage the situation.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.941
You talk about one million people.

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:14.536
It looks enormous,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.060
but the population of the European Union
is 550 million people,

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:23.449
which means we are talking about one
per every [550] Europeans.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:27.402
Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
per three Lebanese.

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:31.657
And Lebanon? Struggling,
of course, but it's managing.

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:35.947
So, the question is: is this something
that could have been managed

00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:38.992
if -- not mentioning the most
important thing,

00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:41.388
which would have been
addressing the root causes,

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:43.388
but forgetting about root causes for now,

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:45.237
looking at the phenomenon as it is --

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:49.551
if Europe were able to come
together in solidarity

00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:53.715
to create an adequate
reception capacity of entry points?

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.423
But for that, the countries at entry
points need to be massively supported,

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:01.452
and then screening the people
with security checks

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:02.881
and all the other mechanisms,

00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:06.410
distributing those that are coming
into all European countries,

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:08.667
according to the possibilities
of each country.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.967
I mean, if you look at
the relocation program

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.054
that was approved by the Commission,
always too little too late,

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:16.000
or by the Council, too little too late --

00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:17.509
BG: It's already breaking down.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.990
AG: My country is supposed
to receive four thousand.

00:04:20.014 --> 00:04:22.021
Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:25.814
So this is perfectly manageable
if it is managed,

00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:29.248
but in the present circumstances,
the pressure is at the point of entry,

00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:32.731
and then, as people move
in this chaotic way through the Balkans,

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.101
then they come to Germany,
Sweden, basically, and Austria.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:39.631
They are the three countries that are,
in the end, receiving the refugees.

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:42.187
The rest of Europe is looking
without doing much.

00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:44.570
BG: Let me try to bring up
three questions,

00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:46.091
playing a bit devil's advocate.

00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:49.037
I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.

00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.100
But I think the questions are very present

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.377
in the minds of many people
in Europe right now,

00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:55.332
The first, of course, is about numbers.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:05:00.162
You say 550 million versus one million
is not much, but realistically,

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:02.136
how many people can Europe take?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.672
AG: Well, that is a question
that has no answer,

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:09.241
because refugees have
the right to be protected.

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:13.114
And there is such a thing
as international law,

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:17.507
so there is no way you can say,
"I take 10,000 and that's finished."

00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.318
I remind you of one thing:

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:23.218
in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,
I remember one minister saying,

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:26.217
"Turkey will be able to receive
up to 100,000 people."

00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:29.686
Turkey has now two million
three-hundred thousand

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.158
or something of the sort,
if you count all refugees.

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:36.371
So I don't think it's fair to say
how many we can take.

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:39.941
What it is fair to say is:
how we can we organize ourselves

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.710
to assume our international
responsibilities?

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:45.184
And Europe has not been able to do so,

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:48.759
because basically, Europe is divided
because there is no solidarity

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:49.962
in the European project.

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:53.112
And it's not only about refugees;
there are many other areas.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:56.770
And let's be honest, this is the moment
in which we need more Europe

00:05:56.794 --> 00:05:58.330
instead of less Europe.

00:05:58.354 --> 00:06:02.973
But as the public less and less believes
in European institutions,

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:06.279
it is also each time more difficult
to convince the public

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:08.605
that we need more Europe
to solve these problems.

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.076
BG: We seem to be at the point

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.511
where the numbers turn into political
shifts, particularly domestically.

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:15.407
We saw it again this weekend in France,

00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:17.883
but we have seen it over
and over in many countries:

00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:20.640
in Poland and in Denmark
and in Switzerland and elsewhere,

00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:24.213
where the mood changes radically
because of the numbers,

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:30.447
although they are not very significant
in absolute numbers.

00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:32.524
The Prime Minister of --

00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:34.270
AG: But, if I may, on these:

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.595
I mean, what does a European see at home

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.215
in a village where there are no migrants?

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:44.867
What a European sees is, on television,

00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:49.291
every single day, a few months ago,
opening the news every single day,

00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:51.753
a crowd coming, uncontrolled,

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.517
moving from border to border,

00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.721
and the images on television
were of hundreds

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:57.412
or thousands of people moving.

00:06:57.436 --> 00:07:00.616
And the idea is that nobody
is taking care of it --

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.989
this is happening without any
kind of management.

00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:06.838
And so their idea was,
"They are coming to my village."

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:10.935
So there was this completely false idea
that Europe was being invaded

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.720
and our way of life is going to change,
and everything will --

00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:18.609
And the problem is that if this
had been properly managed,

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.495
if people had been properly received,

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:25.234
welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,
screened at point of entry,

00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:27.947
and the moved by plane
to different European countries,

00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:30.129
this would not have scared people.

00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:32.796
But, unfortunately, we have
a lot of people scared,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.843
just because Europe was not able
to do the job properly.

00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:37.859
BG: But there are villages in Germany

00:07:37.883 --> 00:07:41.219
with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.

00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.217
So, what's your position?

00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:45.208
How do you imagine these people reacting?

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:48.105
AG: If there would be a proper
management of the situation

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:51.209
and the proper distribution
of people all over Europe,

00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:54.209
you would always have
the percentage that I mentioned:

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:56.035
one per each 2,000.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.328
It is because things are not
properly managed

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.112
that in the end we have situations

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:06.553
that are totally impossible to live with,
and of course if you have a village --

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.254
in Lebanon, there are many villages

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:11.686
that have more Syrians than Lebanese;
Lebanon has been living with that.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.977
I'm not asking for the same
to happen in Europe,

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.188
for all European villages to have
more refugees than inhabitants.

00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:20.267
What I am asking is for Europe
to do the job properly,

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.712
and to be able to organize itself
to receive people

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.664
as other countries in the world
were forced to do in the past.

00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:29.752
BG: So, if you look at the global
situation not only at Europe --

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:31.065
(Applause)

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:32.240
BG: Yes!

00:08:32.264 --> 00:08:36.898
(Applause)

00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:39.943
BG: If you look at the global situation,
so, not only at Europe,

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:42.071
I know you can make
a long list of countries

00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:45.218
that are not really stepping up,

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:47.690
but I'm more interested
in the other part --

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:49.904
is there somebody
who's doing the right thing?

00:08:50.402 --> 00:08:52.833
AG: Well, 86 percent
of the refugees in the world

00:08:52.857 --> 00:08:54.912
are in the developing world.

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:58.256
And if you look at
countries like Ethiopia --

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.057
Ethiopia has received
more than 600,000 refugees.

00:09:02.486 --> 00:09:04.502
All the borders in Ethiopia are open.

00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:07.172
And they have, as a policy,

00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:11.292
they call the "people to people" policy
that every refugee should be received.

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:12.895
And they have South Sudanese,

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.927
they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.

00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:16.808
They have all the neighbors.

00:09:16.832 --> 00:09:18.596
They have Eritreans.

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:20.224
And, in general,

00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:24.428
African countries are extremely
welcoming of refugees coming,

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:27.024
and I would say that in the Middle East

00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:32.241
and in Asia, we have seen a tendency
for borders to be open.

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:35.630
Now we see some problems
with the Syrian situation,

00:09:35.654 --> 00:09:39.911
as the Syrian situation evolved
into also a major security crisis,

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:42.028
but the truth is that for a large period,

00:09:42.052 --> 00:09:44.044
all borders in the Middle East were open.

00:09:44.068 --> 00:09:45.520
The truth is that for Afghans,

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:48.377
the borders of Pakistan and Iran
were open for, at the time,

00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:50.294
six million Afghans that came.

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:54.139
So I would say that even today,
the trend in the developing world

00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:56.489
has been for borders to be open.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:10:00.925
The trend in the developed world
is for these questions to become

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:03.055
more and more complex,

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:05.650
especially when there is,
in the public opinion,

00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:10.757
a mixture of discussions between refugee
protections on one side

00:10:10.781 --> 00:10:14.420
and security questions -- in my opinion,
misinterpreted -- on the other side.

00:10:14.444 --> 00:10:15.985
BG: We'll come back to that too,

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:18.749
but you mentioned the cutting
of funding and the vouchers

00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:20.233
from the World Food Programme.

00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:23.090
That reflects the general underfunding
of the organizations

00:10:23.114 --> 00:10:25.430
working on these issues.

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:28.710
Now that the world seems to have woken up,

00:10:28.734 --> 00:10:30.925
are you getting more funding
and more support,

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:32.362
or it's still the same?

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:34.185
AG: We are getting more support.

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:38.642
I would say that we are coming
close to the levels of last year.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.449
We were much worse during the summer.

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:45.657
But that is clearly insufficient
to address the needs of the people

00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:47.571
and address the needs of the countries

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.094
that are supporting the people.

00:10:49.118 --> 00:10:55.044
And here we have a basic review
of the criteria, the objectives,

00:10:55.068 --> 00:10:57.860
the priorities of development
cooperation that is required.

00:10:57.884 --> 00:11:00.887
For instance, Lebanon and Jordan
are middle-income countries.

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.885
Because they are middle-income countries,

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:05.820
they cannot receive soft loans
or grants from the World Bank.

00:11:05.844 --> 00:11:08.043
Now, today this doesn't make any sense,

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.396
because they are providing
a global public good.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.230
They have millions of refugees there,

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:15.744
and to be honest, they are pillars
of stability in the region,

00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:17.506
with all the difficulties they face,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.220
and the first line of defense
of our collective security.

00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:21.407
So it doesn't make sense

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.574
that these countries
are not a first priority

00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:25.343
in development cooperation policies.

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:26.526
And they are not.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.952
And not only do the refugees live
in very dramatic circumstances

00:11:29.976 --> 00:11:31.206
inside those countries,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.056
but the local communities
themselves are suffering,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.336
because salaries went down,

00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:39.138
because there are more unemployed,

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:41.562
because prices and rents went up.

00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:46.182
And, of course, if you look
at today's situation

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.304
of the indicators in these countries,

00:11:49.328 --> 00:11:54.811
it is clear that, especially
their poor groups of the population,

00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:58.070
are living worse and worse
because of the crisis they are facing.

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:00.078
BG: Who should be providing this support?

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:03.423
Country by country, international
organizations, the European Union?

00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:05.495
Who should be coming up with this support?

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.064
AG: We need to join all efforts.

00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:09.633
It's clear that bilateral
cooperation is essential.

00:12:09.657 --> 00:12:12.420
It's clear that multilateral
cooperation is essential.

00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:16.039
It's clear that international financial
institutions should have flexibility

00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:18.782
in order to be able to invest
more massively

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.332
in support to these countries.

00:12:20.356 --> 00:12:23.602
We need to combine all the instruments
and to understand that today,

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:26.072
in protracted situations,
at a certain moment,

00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.766
that it doesn't make sense anymore
to make a distinction

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.439
between humanitarian aid
and development aid

00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:34.812
or development processes.

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:38.439
Because you are talking
about children in school,

00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:39.872
you are talking about health,

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:42.728
you are talking about infrastructure
that is overcrowded.

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:46.321
You are talking about things
that require a long-term perspective,

00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:47.678
a development perspective

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:50.738
and not only an emergency
humanitarian aid perspective.

00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:53.171
BG: I would like your comment on something

00:12:53.195 --> 00:12:54.948
that was in newspapers this morning.

00:12:54.972 --> 00:13:00.344
It is a statement made
by the current front-runner

00:13:00.368 --> 00:13:03.714
for the Republican nomination
for US President, Donald Trump.

00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:05.104
Yesterday, he said this.

00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:06.129
(Laughter)

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.945
No, listen to this. It's interesting.

00:13:07.969 --> 00:13:10.839
I quote: "I am calling for a total
and complete shutdown

00:13:10.863 --> 00:13:12.561
of Muslims entering the US,

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:16.901
until our country's representatives
can figure out what's going on."

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:18.784
How do you react to that?

00:13:18.808 --> 00:13:20.892
AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:23.182
We have seen several people
around the world

00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:25.619
with political responsibility
saying, for instance,

00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:27.801
that Muslims refugees
should not be received.

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:31.608
And the reason why they say this

00:13:31.632 --> 00:13:34.731
is because they think
that by doing or saying this,

00:13:34.755 --> 00:13:37.337
they are protecting
the security of their countries.

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.794
Now, I've been in government.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.096
I am very keen on the need for governments

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.565
to protect the security of their countries

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:44.740
and their people.

00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:47.687
But if you say, like that,

00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:50.217
in the US or in any European country,

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:54.187
"We are going to close our doors
to Muslim refugees,"

00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:57.323
what you are saying
is the best possible help

00:13:57.347 --> 00:13:59.757
for the propaganda
of terrorist organizations.

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.758
Because what you are saying --

00:14:01.782 --> 00:14:07.357
(Applause)

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:12.964
What you are saying will be heard
by all the Muslims in your own country,

00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:15.061
and it will pave the way
for the recruitment

00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:17.706
and the mechanisms that,
through technology,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.585
Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,
and all those other groups

00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:24.007
are today penetrating in our societies.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:28.152
And it's just telling them,
"You are right, we are against you."

00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:34.566
So obviously, this is creating
in societies that are all multiethnic,

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.339
multi-religious, multicultural,

00:14:36.363 --> 00:14:39.735
this is creating a situation
in which, really,

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:43.149
it is much easier for the propaganda
of these terrorist organizations

00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:48.286
to be effective in recruiting
people for terror acts

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.224
within the countries where these kinds
of sentences are expressed.

00:14:52.248 --> 00:14:55.231
BG: Have the recent attacks in Paris
and the reactions to them

00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:57.238
made your job more difficult?

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:58.621
AG: Undoubtedly.

00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:00.106
BG: In what sense?

00:15:00.992 --> 00:15:05.308
AG: In the sense that, I mean,
for many people the first reaction

00:15:05.332 --> 00:15:08.752
in relation to these kinds of terrorist
attacks is: close all borders --

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:13.221
not understanding that the terrorist
problem in Europe is largely homegrown.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:18.218
We have thousands and thousands
of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,

00:15:18.242 --> 00:15:22.472
so this is not something that you solve
by just not allowing Syrians to come in.

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:24.952
And I must say, I am convinced

00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:29.148
that the passport that appeared,

00:15:29.172 --> 00:15:32.919
I believe, was put
by the person who has blown --

00:15:32.943 --> 00:15:34.474
BG: -- himself up, yeah.

00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:36.409
AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,

00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:40.051
because part of the strategies
of Daesh is against refugees,

00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:43.488
because they see refugees as people
that should be with the caliphate

00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:45.964
and are fleeing to the crusaders.

00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:50.051
And I think that is part of Daesh's
strategy to make Europe react,

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.466
closing its doors to Muslim refugees

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.181
and having an hostility
towards Muslims inside Europe,

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:59.727
exactly to facilitate Daesh's work.

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:04.259
And my deep belief is that
it was not the refugee movement

00:16:04.283 --> 00:16:05.964
that triggered terrorism.

00:16:05.988 --> 00:16:07.148
I think, as I said,

00:16:07.172 --> 00:16:10.699
essentially terrorism in Europe
is today a homegrown movement

00:16:10.723 --> 00:16:14.018
in relation to the global situation
that we are facing,

00:16:14.042 --> 00:16:18.462
and what we need is exactly
to prove these groups wrong,

00:16:18.486 --> 00:16:21.959
by welcoming and integrating effectively

00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:24.386
those that are coming
from that part of the world.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.426
And another thing that I believe
is that to a large extent,

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.913
what we are today paying for in Europe

00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:32.107
is the failures of integration models

00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:35.272
that didn't work in the '60s,
in the '70s, in the '80s,

00:16:35.296 --> 00:16:38.267
in relation to big migration flows
that took place at that time

00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:42.080
and generated what is today
in many of the people, for instance,

00:16:42.104 --> 00:16:44.847
of the second generation of communities,

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:49.002
a situation of feeling marginalized,

00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:50.416
having no jobs,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.979
having improper education,

00:16:52.003 --> 00:16:57.228
living in some of the neighborhoods
that are not adequately provided

00:16:57.252 --> 00:16:59.494
by public infrastructure.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:04.351
And this kind of uneasiness,
sometimes even anger,

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:06.844
that exists in this second generation

00:17:06.868 --> 00:17:09.891
is largely due to the failure
of integration policies,

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:13.796
to the failure of what should have been
a much stronger investment

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.208
in creating the conditions for people
to live together and respect each other.

00:17:18.232 --> 00:17:19.540
For me it is clear.

00:17:19.564 --> 00:17:22.805
(Applause)

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:26.699
For me it is clear that all societies
will be multiethnic, multicultural,

00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:28.349
multi-religious in the future.

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:31.904
To try to avoid it is,
in my opinion, impossible.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.320
And for me it's a good thing
that they will be like that,

00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:38.722
but I also recognize that,
for that to work properly,

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.702
you need a huge investment

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.162
in the social cohesion
of your own societies.

00:17:43.186 --> 00:17:46.860
And Europe, to a large extent,
failed in that investment

00:17:46.884 --> 00:17:50.097
in the past few decades.

00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:54.117
BG: Question: You are stepping down
from your job at the end of the year,

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:55.674
after 10 years.

00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:57.135
If you look back at 2005,

00:17:57.159 --> 00:18:00.234
when you entered that office
for the first time, what do you see?

00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:03.346
AG: Well, look:

00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:09.843
In 2005, we were helping
one million people go back home

00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:12.915
in safety and dignity,
because conflicts had ended.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:16.357
Last year, we helped 124,000.

00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:22.747
In 2005, we had about 38 million people
displaced by conflict in the world.

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.242
Today, we have more than 60 million.

00:18:26.052 --> 00:18:29.119
At that time, we had had, recently,

00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:31.822
some conflicts that were solved.

00:18:32.393 --> 00:18:34.700
Now, we see a multiplication
of new conflicts

00:18:34.724 --> 00:18:36.565
and the old conflicts never died:

00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:39.945
Afghanistan, Somalia,
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:18:39.969 --> 00:18:44.025
It is clear that the world today
is much more dangerous than it was.

00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:46.893
It is clear that the capacity
of the international community

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.793
to prevent conflicts
and to timely solve them,

00:18:49.817 --> 00:18:53.971
is, unfortunately, much worse
than what it was 10 years ago.

00:18:53.995 --> 00:18:56.740
There are no clear
power relations in the world,

00:18:56.764 --> 00:18:59.257
no global governance mechanisms that work,

00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:02.060
which means that we live in a situation

00:19:02.084 --> 00:19:07.010
where impunity and unpredictability
tend to prevail, and that means

00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:09.449
that more and more people suffer,

00:19:09.473 --> 00:19:11.866
namely those that are
displaced by conflicts.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.896
BG: It's a tradition in American politics

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.550
that when a President leaves
the Oval Office for the last time,

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.351
he leaves a handwritten note
on the desk for his successor

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:22.476
that walks in a couple of hours later.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.685
If you had to write such a note
to your successor, Filippo Grandi,

00:19:25.709 --> 00:19:26.861
what would you write?

00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:29.949
AG: Well, I don't think
I would write any message.

00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:32.948
You know, one of the terrible things
when one leaves an office

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:35.702
is to try to become the backseat driver,

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:38.613
always telling the new one what to do.

00:19:38.637 --> 00:19:40.153
So that, I will not do.

00:19:40.177 --> 00:19:42.121
If I had to say something to him,

00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:44.422
it would be, "Be yourself,
and do your best."

00:19:44.753 --> 00:19:46.999
BG: Commissioner, thank you
for the job you do.

00:19:47.023 --> 00:19:48.528
Thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:48.552 --> 00:19:52.894
(Applause)
