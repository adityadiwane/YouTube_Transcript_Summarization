00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.451
I'd like you to come back with me for a moment

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.475
to the 19th century,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.923
specifically to June 24, 1833.

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:24.978
The British Association for the Advancement of Science

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.769
is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980
It's the first night of the meeting,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.843
and a confrontation is about to take place

00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:37.451
that will change science forever.

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:40.428
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:43.890
The members of the Association are shocked to realize

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.914
that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:51.874
who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:54.770
They're even more shocked by what he says.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.206
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:03.250
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.298
pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.754
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.118
or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:15.090
like the members of the British Association.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.677
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:23.055
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.271
and quieted the audience.

00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:28.098
He politely agreed that an appropriate name

00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:31.914
for the members of the association did not exist.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:37.458
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:42.274
he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,'

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:46.214
we may form 'scientist.'"

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.843
This was the first time the word scientist

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:50.697
was uttered in public,

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:54.293
only 179 years ago.

00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:57.438
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,

00:01:57.438 --> 00:01:59.482
and it kind of blew me away.

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:01.666
I mean, how could the word scientist

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:05.155
not have existed until 1833?

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.346
What were scientists called before?

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:10.671
What had changed to make a new name necessary

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:13.801
precisely at that moment?

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.895
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:19.067
were talented amateurs.

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:21.355
Think of the country clergyman or squire

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:23.868
collecting his beetles or fossils,

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:26.163
like Charles Darwin, for example,

00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:30.339
or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.695
who was the literary companion

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:34.855
to the Marquis of Lansdowne

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.727
when he discovered oxygen.

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:40.527
After this, they were scientists,

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:44.361
professionals with a particular scientific method,

00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:48.096
goals, societies and funding.

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:51.372
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men

00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:54.631
who met at Cambridge University in 1812:

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.186
Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:01.663
These were brilliant, driven men

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:04.935
who accomplished amazing things.

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:07.934
Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:10.729
invented the first mechanical calculator

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.752
and the first prototype of a modern computer.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:18.812
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:23.042
and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:25.190
I'm sure we could all be that productive

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.074
without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:31.364
Richard Jones became an important economist

00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:33.891
who later influenced Karl Marx.

00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:37.413
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist,

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:41.448
as well as the words anode, cathode and ion,

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:44.484
but spearheaded international big science

00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:47.580
with his global research on the tides.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.292
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:55.055
the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:56.815
They talked about science

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:59.937
and the need for a new scientific revolution.

00:03:59.937 --> 00:04:01.828
They felt science had stagnated

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:05.080
since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.318
in the 17th century.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.384
It was time for a new revolution,

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.508
which they pledged to bring about,

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:14.229
and what's so amazing about these guys is,

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.012
not only did they have these

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:18.605
grandiose undergraduate dreams,

00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:20.845
but they actually carried them out,

00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:23.893
even beyond their wildest dreams.

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:24.985
And I'm going to tell you today

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:29.942
about four major changes to science these men made.

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:32.365
About 200 years before,

00:04:32.365 --> 00:04:35.093
Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,

00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:38.805
had proposed an inductive scientific method.

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:41.342
Now that's a method that starts from

00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:43.797
observations and experiments

00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:47.269
and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.753
which are always subject to revision or rejection

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:52.298
should new evidence arise.

00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:57.681
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters

00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.630
by arguing that the science of economics

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.779
should use a different, deductive method.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.458
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:11.539
began arguing that because it worked so well in economics,

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.209
this deductive method ought to be applied

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:16.883
to the natural sciences too.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.539
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.821
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method

00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:25.453
in all the sciences

00:05:25.453 --> 00:05:28.311
that were widely read by natural philosophers,

00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:31.733
university students and members of the public.

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:33.489
Reading one of Herschel's books

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:36.279
was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:40.076
that he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:42.663
made so deep an impression on me.

00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:45.271
It made me wish to add my might

00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:48.799
to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:51.911
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method,

00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.770
as well as that used by his peers.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.548
[Science for the public good]

00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:00.142
Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge

00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:02.775
ought to be used for the good of the king or queen,

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:05.688
or for one's own personal gain.

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:08.391
For example, ship captains needed to know

00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.578
information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:14.771
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge

00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:17.787
and sell it to the ship captains.

00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:20.395
The philosophical breakfast club changed that,

00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:21.745
working together.

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:23.825
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:26.963
resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps

00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:29.950
that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.051
to all ship captains.

00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.853
Herschel helped by making tidal observations

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.821
off the coast of South Africa,

00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:39.171
and, as he complained to Whewell,

00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:44.323
he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.

00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:47.051
The four men really helped each other in every way.

00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.363
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government

00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:52.999
for the money to build Babbage's engines

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.990
because they believed these engines

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.824
would have a huge practical impact on society.

00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.444
In the days before pocket calculators,

00:07:01.444 --> 00:07:04.780
the numbers that most professionals needed --

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.388
bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers —

00:07:08.388 --> 00:07:11.472
were to be found in lookup books like this,

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.868
filled with tables of figures.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.276
These tables were calculated

00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:19.195
using a fixed procedure over and over

00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:23.864
by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers,

00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:26.743
but these calculations were really difficult.

00:07:26.743 --> 00:07:28.991
I mean, this nautical almanac

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.861
published the lunar differences for every month of the year.

00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:37.527
Each month required 1,365 calculations,

00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:40.511
so these tables were filled with mistakes.

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:44.676
Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:48.655
devised to accurately compute any of these tables.

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:52.191
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years

00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:54.951
by a team from the Science Museum of London

00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.634
using his own plans.

00:07:56.634 --> 00:08:00.772
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:04.479
and it calculates accurately. It actually works.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:07.094
Later, Babbage's analytical engine

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:11.379
was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.333
It had a separate memory and central processor.

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:17.786
It was capable of iteration, conditional branching

00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:19.258
and parallel processing,

00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:22.230
and it was programmable using punched cards,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.702
an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:29.938
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day

00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:32.125
because most people thought that

00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.020
non-human computers would have no usefulness

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.602
for the public.

00:08:36.602 --> 00:08:38.614
[New scientific institutions]

00:08:38.614 --> 00:08:42.119
Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:45.116
was the foremost scientific society in England

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:47.357
and even in the rest of the world.

00:08:47.357 --> 00:08:49.822
By the 19th century, it had become

00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.655
a kind of gentleman's club

00:08:51.655 --> 00:08:56.662
populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.815
The members of the philosophical breakfast club

00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:01.829
helped form a number of new scientific societies,

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:04.229
including the British Association.

00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:06.612
These new societies required

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:10.102
that members be active researchers publishing their results.

00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:12.942
They reinstated the tradition of the Q&amp;A

00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:15.212
after scientific papers were read,

00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:17.532
which had been discontinued by the Royal Society

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:20.437
as being ungentlemanly.

00:09:20.437 --> 00:09:25.333
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:27.993
Members were encouraged to bring their wives,

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:31.919
daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.689
and while the women were expected to attend

00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:38.530
only the public lectures and the social events like this one,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.639
they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.523
The British Association would later be the first

00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:49.167
of the major national science organizations in the world

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.872
to admit women as full members.

00:09:51.872 --> 00:09:53.313
[External funding for science]

00:09:53.313 --> 00:09:54.708
Up to the 19th century,

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:57.020
natural philosophers were expected to pay

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.333
for their own equipment and supplies.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.796
Occasionally, there were prizes,

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:05.125
such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:08.208
for solving the so-called longitude problem,

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:11.053
but prizes were only given after the fact,

00:10:11.053 --> 00:10:12.837
when they were given at all.

00:10:12.837 --> 00:10:15.741
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,

00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:19.052
the British Association began to use the extra money

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:21.726
generated by its meetings to give grants

00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:24.948
for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,

00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:27.775
shipbuilding, and many other areas.

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:29.550
These grants not only allowed

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.893
less wealthy men to conduct research,

00:10:31.893 --> 00:10:34.829
but they also encouraged thinking outside the box,

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:38.902
rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.

00:10:38.902 --> 00:10:41.301
Eventually, the Royal Society

00:10:41.301 --> 00:10:44.710
and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.558
and this has become -- fortunately it's become --

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:52.324
a major part of the scientific landscape today.

00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:55.338
So the philosophical breakfast club

00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:58.485
helped invent the modern scientist.

00:10:58.485 --> 00:11:01.713
That's the heroic part of their story.

00:11:01.713 --> 00:11:04.652
There's a flip side as well.

00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:07.636
They did not foresee at least one consequence

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:10.172
of their revolution.

00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:12.548
They would have been deeply dismayed

00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:17.032
by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.

00:11:17.032 --> 00:11:19.689
It's shocking to realize

00:11:19.689 --> 00:11:23.029
that only 28 percent of American adults

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:26.580
have even a very basic level of science literacy,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.651
and this was tested by asking simple questions like,

00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:33.460
"Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.222
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"

00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:42.215
Once scientists became members of a professional group,

00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:45.580
they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.507
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution

00:11:49.507 --> 00:11:52.542
that started with our four friends.

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:54.335
Charles Darwin said,

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:58.420
"I sometimes think that general and popular treatises

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.189
are almost as important for the progress of science

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:02.776
as original work."

00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:05.890
In fact, "Origin of Species" was written

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.999
for a general and popular audience,

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:11.892
and was widely read when it first appeared.

00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:15.903
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:20.322
that science is not only for scientists.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.943
Thank you.

00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:27.190
