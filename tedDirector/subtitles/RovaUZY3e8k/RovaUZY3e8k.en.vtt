00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.635
I'm a toy developer.

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:22.899
With a dream of creating new toys
that have never been seen before,

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.506
I began working at a toy company
nine years ago.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.062
When I first started working there,

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:32.020
I proposed many new ideas
to my boss every day.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.838
However, my boss always asked

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:37.442
if I had the data to prove it would sell,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.875
and asked me to think of product
development after analyzing market data.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.289
Data, data, data.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.788
So I analyzed the market data
before thinking of a product.

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:51.080
However, I was unable to think
of anything new at that moment.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.542
(Laughter)

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.591
My ideas were unoriginal.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:58.904
I wasn't getting any new ideas
and I grew tired of thinking.

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:03.585
It was so hard that I became this skinny.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.582
(Laughter)

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:07.344
It's true.
(Applause)

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:12.279
You've all probably had
similar experiences and felt this way too.

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.891
Your boss was being difficult.
The data was difficult.

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.682
You become sick of thinking.

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:19.587
Now, I throw out the data.

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:22.596
It's my dream to create new toys.

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:24.824
And now, instead of data,

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:29.012
I'm using a game called Shiritori
to come up with new ideas.

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:32.580
I would like to introduce
this method today.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.701
What is Shiritori?

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.166
Take apple, elephant 
and trumpet, for example.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.400
It's a game where 
you take turns saying words

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.962
that start with the last letter
of the previous word.

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.864
It's the same in Japanese and English.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.158
You can play Shiritori as you like:

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:49.396
"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc.
[Cat, cola, concert, brush]

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:52.084
Many random words will come out.

00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:57.174
You force those words to connect to what
you want to think of and form ideas.

00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:00.777
In my case, for example,
since I want to think of toys,

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:03.660
what could a toy cat be?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.227
A cat that lands after doing
a somersault from a high place?

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.353
How about a toy with cola?

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:12.354
A toy gun where you shoot cola
and get someone soaking wet?

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:13.343
(Laughter)

00:02:13.343 --> 00:02:16.376
Ridiculous ideas are okay.
The key is to keep them flowing.

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:21.732
The more ideas you produce, you're sure
to come up with some good ones, too.

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:26.598
A brush, for example.
Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?

00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:30.464
We could combine
a toothbrush with a guitar and --

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:32.609
(Music noises) --

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.765
you've got a toy you can play with
while brushing your teeth.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:37.531
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.484
Kids who don't like to brush
their teeth might begin to like it.

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:44.706
Can we make a hat into a toy?

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:48.757
How about something like a roulette game,
where you try the hat on one by one,

00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:53.641
and then, when someone puts it on,
a scary alien breaks through the top

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.635
screaming, "Ahh!"

00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:58.630
I wonder if there would be
a demand for this at parties?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.873
Ideas that didn't come out while you stare
at the data will start to come out.

00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:09.745
Actually, this bubble wrap,
which is used to pack fragile objects,

00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:14.551
combined with a toy,
made Mugen Pop Pop,

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:17.823
a toy where you can pop
the bubbles as much as you like.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.013
It was a big hit when it reached stores.

00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:22.960
Data had nothing to do with its success.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.662
Although it's only popping bubbles,

00:03:25.662 --> 00:03:27.716
it's a great way to kill time,

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:29.770
so please pass this around

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.325
amongst yourselves today and play with it.

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:34.486
(Applause)

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:39.544
Anyway, you continue to come up with
useless ideas.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.894
Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.

00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:45.591
If you base your ideas on data analysis
and know what you're aiming for,

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.060
you'll end up trying too hard,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.002
and you can't produce new ideas.

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.235
Even if you know what your aim is,

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:56.121
think of ideas as freely as if you were
throwing darts with your eyes closed.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:59.272
If you do this, you surely will hit
somewhere near the center.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.860
At least one will.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.907
That's the one you should choose.

00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:05.541
If you do so, that idea will be in demand

00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:08.325
and, moreover, it will be brand new.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.441
That is how I think of new ideas.

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:13.633
It doesn't have to be Shiritori;
there are many different methods.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.543
You just have to choose words at random.

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:18.490
You can flip through a dictionary
and choose words at random.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.904
For example, you could look up two
random letters and gather the results

00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:26.552
or go to the store
and connect product names

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:29.992
with what you want to think of.

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:33.142
The point is to gather random words,

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:36.487
not information from the category
you're thinking for.

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:42.467
If you do this, the ingredients for
the association of ideas are collected

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:45.356
and form connections
that will produce many ideas.

00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:49.245
The greatest advantage to this method
is the continuous flow of images.

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:52.218
Because you're thinking
of one word after another,

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:54.884
the image of the previous word
is still with you.

00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:57.649
That image will automatically
be related with future words.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.171
Unconsciously, a concert will
be connected to a brush

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:02.360
and a roulette game
will be connected to a hat.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.740
You wouldn't even realize it.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.081
You can come up with ideas that
you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:09.181
This method is, of course,
not just for toys.

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.892
You can collect ideas for books, apps,
events, and many other projects.

00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:16.940
I hope you all try this method.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.089
There are futures that are born from data.

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.859
However, using this silly game
called Shiritori,

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:28.959
I look forward to
the exciting future you will create,

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:32.490
a future you couldn't even imagine.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.891
Thank you very much.

00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.631
(Applause)
