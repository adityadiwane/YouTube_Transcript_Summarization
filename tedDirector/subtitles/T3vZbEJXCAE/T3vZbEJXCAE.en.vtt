00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.160
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
is HIV positive.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.160
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
He liked to sit on her lap

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.160
because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.160
and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and he asked me for slippers,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
because he said that his feet were cold.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Single mother, HIV positive.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
I photographed her before and after

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
at the age of 23.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
like so many other Zimbabwean children

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
who've been orphaned by the epidemic.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
So a few of the stories.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
With every picture,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
there are individuals who have full lives

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and stories that deserve to be told.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160
just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
CA: Just --

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
for a fashion photographer.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
And I was constantly reading the New York Times,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
It was just frightening.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
So I quit my job

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
this is in December 2000 --

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
and then went back again this March 2002

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
CA: That's an amazing story, thank you.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.
