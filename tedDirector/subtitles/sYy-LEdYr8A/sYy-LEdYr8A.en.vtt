00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:14.993
About 12 years ago,

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:17.245
I gave up my career in banking

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.356
to try to make the world a safer place.

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:24.565
This involved a journey into
national and global advocacy

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:29.388
and meeting some of the most
extraordinary people in the world.

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:34.566
In the process, I became
a civil society diplomat.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.072
Civil society diplomats do three things:

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:40.603
They voice the concerns of the people,

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.691
are not pinned down by national interests,

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:46.528
and influence change
through citizen networks,

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:49.084
not only state ones.

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:53.683
And if you want to change the world,
we need more of them.

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:56.190
But many people still ask,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.741
"Can civil society really
make a big difference?

00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:06.012
Can citizens influence and shape
national and global policy?"

00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:08.961
I never thought I would ask
myself these questions,

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.211
but here I am to share some lessons

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:17.227
about two powerful civil society 
movements that I've been involved in.

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:21.035
They are in issues
that I'm passionate about:

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.214
gun control and drug policy.

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:28.859
And these are issues that matter here.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.253
Latin America is ground zero
for both of them.

00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:36.296
For example, Brazil --

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:42.550
this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal
has the world's ugliest record.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.448
We are the number one champion
in homicidal violence.

00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:54.564
One in every 10 people killed
around the world is a Brazilian.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.678
This translates into over 56,000 people

00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:03.161
dying violently each year.

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:09.082
Most of them are young, black boys
dying by guns.

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:14.213
Brazil is also one of the world's
largest consumers of drugs,

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:19.066
and the War on Drugs
has been especially painful here.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.339
Around 50 percent of the homicides
in the streets in Brazil

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.776
are related to the War on Drugs.

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:31.464
The same is true for about
25 percent of people in jail.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:36.596
And it's not just Brazil that is affected
by the twin problems of guns and drugs.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:43.620
Virtually every country and city across
Central and South America is in trouble.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.869
Latin America has nine percent
of the world's population,

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:52.930
but 25 percent
of its global violent deaths.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.972
These are not problems
we can run away from.

00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:58.271
I certainly could not.

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:03.147
So the first campaign I got involved with
started here in 2003

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:05.190
to change Brazil's gun law

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.278
and to create a program
to buy back weapons.

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:09.857
In just a few years,

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.295
we not only changed national legislation

00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:16.033
that made it much more difficult
for civilians to buy a gun,

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:21.683
but we collected and destroyed
almost half a million weapons.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:26.262
This was one of the biggest
buyback programs in history --

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:28.921
(Applause) --

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:32.542
but we also suffered some setbacks.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:38.324
We lost a referendum to ban
gun sales to civilians in 2005.

00:03:38.324 --> 00:03:41.597
The second initiative was also home-grown,

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:47.147
but is today a global movement to reform
the international drug control regime.

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:48.938
I am the executive coordinator

00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:53.416
of something called
the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:55.854
The commission is a high-level group

00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:59.755
of global leaders brought together
to identify more humane

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:03.911
and effective approaches
to the issue of drugs.

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.479
Since we started in 2008,
the taboo on drugs is broken.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:13.431
Across the Americas, from the US
and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:15.579
change is in the air.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.381
But rather than tell you the whole story
about these two movements,

00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:23.189
I just want to share with you
four key insights.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.788
I call them lessons to change the world.

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:29.017
There are certainly many more,

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:32.314
but these are the ones
that stand out to me.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.496
So the first lesson is:

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:37.770
Change and control the narrative.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.604
It may seem obvious,

00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.646
but a key ingredient
to civil society diplomacy

00:04:42.646 --> 00:04:46.733
is first changing and then
controlling the narrative.

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:49.890
This is something that veteran
politicians understand,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.813
but that civil society groups
generally do not do very well.

00:04:54.813 --> 00:04:57.158
In the case of drug policy,

00:04:57.158 --> 00:05:00.618
our biggest success has been
to change the discussion

00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:03.427
away from prosecuting a War on Drugs

00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:07.398
to putting people's health
and safety first.

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:10.834
In a cutting-edge report
we just launched in New York,

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:18.403
we also showed that the groups benefiting
most from this $320 billion market

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:21.724
are criminal gangs and cartels.

00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:25.462
So in order to undermine
the power and profit of these groups,

00:05:25.462 --> 00:05:28.434
we need to change the conversation.

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:34.726
We need to make illegal drugs legal.

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:37.559
But before I get you too excited,

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.694
I don't mean drugs
should be a free-for-all.

00:05:40.702 --> 00:05:44.827
What I'm talking about, and what
the Global Commission advocates for

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:49.354
is creating a highly regulated market,

00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:54.579
where different drugs would have
different degrees of regulation.

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.619
As for gun control,
we were successful in changing,

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.544
but not so much
in controlling, the narrative.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:04.400
And this brings me to my next lesson:

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.324
Never underestimate your opponents.

00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:10.553
If you want to succeed
in changing the world,

00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:12.922
you need to know who you're up against.

00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:16.590
You need to learn their motivations
and points of view.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.796
In the case of gun control,

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.349
we really underestimated our opponents.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.274
After a very successful
gun-collection program,

00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:26.618
we were elated.

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:29.454
We had support from
80 percent of Brazilians,

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:32.335
and thought that this could help us
win the referendum

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:34.747
to ban gun sales to civilians.

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:37.928
But we were dead wrong.

00:06:37.928 --> 00:06:41.249
During a televised 20-day public debate,

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.103
our opponent used
our own arguments against us.

00:06:45.103 --> 00:06:47.332
We ended up losing the popular vote.

00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:49.677
It was really terrible.

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:55.836
The National Rifle Association --
yes, the American NRA --

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.595
came to Brazil.

00:06:57.595 --> 00:07:00.695
They inundated our campaign
with their propaganda,

00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:02.238
that as you know,

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:06.581
links the right to own guns
to ideas of freedom and democracy.

00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:10.458
They simply threw everything at us.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.385
They used our national flag,

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.080
our independence anthem.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.915
They invoked women's rights

00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:21.302
and misused images of Mandela,
Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.

00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:25.272
They won by playing with people's fears.

00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:29.916
In fact, guns were almost completely
ignored in their campaign.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:33.213
Their focus was on individual rights.

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:34.792
But I ask you,

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:37.021
which right is more important,

00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:38.832
the right to life

00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:41.897
or the right to have a gun
that takes life away?

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:46.150
(Applause)

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.972
We thought people would vote
in defense of life,

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:54.756
but in a country with a recent past
of military dictatorship,

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:59.027
the anti-government message
of our opponents resonated,

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:02.626
and we were not prepared to respond.

00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:04.715
Lesson learned.

00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:08.005
We've been more successful
in the case of drug policy.

00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:12.719
If you asked most people 10 years ago if
an end to the War on Drugs was possible,

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:14.731
they would have laughed.

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:18.229
After all, there are huge
military police prisons

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:22.325
and financial establishments
benefiting from this war.

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:28.097
But today, the international drug
control regime is starting to crumble.

00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:32.926
Governments and civil societies
are experimenting with new approaches.

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:35.248
The Global Commission on Drug Policy

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.315
really knew its opposition,

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:39.149
and rather than fighting them,

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:43.793
our chair -- former Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso --

00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:48.065
reached out to leaders
from across the political spectrum,

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:50.875
from liberals to conservatives.

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:55.751
This high level group
agreed to honestly discuss

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:57.701
the merits and flaws of drug policies.

00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:02.461
It was this reasoned, informed
and strategic discussion

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:06.222
that revealed the sad truth
about the War on Drugs.

00:09:06.222 --> 00:09:12.538
The War on Drugs has simply failed
across every metric.

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:15.440
Drugs are cheaper
and more available than ever,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.227
and consumption has risen globally.

00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:20.409
But even worse,

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:26.980
it also generated massive
negative unintended consequences.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.626
It is true that some people
have made these arguments before,

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.366
but we've made a difference

00:09:32.366 --> 00:09:35.378
by anticipating the arguments
of our opponents

00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:37.484
and by leveraging powerful voices

00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:42.374
that a few years ago
would probably have resisted change.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:46.461
Third lesson: Use data
to drive your argument.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.456
Guns and drugs are emotive issues,

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:53.357
and as we've painfully learned
in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,

00:09:53.357 --> 00:09:56.422
sometimes it's impossible
to cut through the emotions

00:09:56.422 --> 00:09:58.512
and get to the facts.

00:09:58.512 --> 00:10:01.600
But this doesn't mean
that we shouldn't try.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.251
Until quite recently,

00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:07.265
we simply didn't know
how many Brazilians were killed by guns.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:12.780
Amazingly, it was a local soap opera
called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.498
or "Women in Love" --

00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:18.410
that kicked off Brazil's
national gun control campaign.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.872
In one highly viewed episode,

00:10:20.872 --> 00:10:25.074
a soap opera lead actress
was killed by a stray bullet.

00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:29.370
Brazilian grannies
and housewives were outraged,

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.644
and in a case of art imitating life,

00:10:32.644 --> 00:10:37.938
this episode also included footage
of a real gun control march

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:40.422
that we had organized right here,

00:10:40.422 --> 00:10:43.255
outside in Copacabana Beach.

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:48.699
The televised death and march
had a huge impact on public opinion.

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:53.483
Within weeks, our national congress
approved the disarmament bill

00:10:53.483 --> 00:10:56.571
that had been languishing for years.

00:10:56.571 --> 00:10:59.586
We were then able to mobilize data

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:02.886
to show the successful outcomes
of the change in the law

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:05.007
and gun collection program.

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:06.769
Here is what I mean:

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:10.293
We could prove that in just one year,

00:11:10.293 --> 00:11:15.099
we saved more than 5,000 lives.

00:11:15.099 --> 00:11:18.862
(Applause)

00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:21.276
And in the case of drugs,

00:11:21.276 --> 00:11:26.570
in order to undermine this fear
and prejudice that surrounds the issue,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.678
we managed to gather and present data
that shows that today's drug policies

00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:35.549
cause much more harm than drug use per se,

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:39.682
and people are starting to get it.

00:11:39.682 --> 00:11:41.818
My fourth insight is:

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:46.044
Don't be afraid to bring
together odd bedfellows.

00:11:46.044 --> 00:11:48.018
What we've learned in Brazil --

00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:50.363
and this doesn't only
apply to my country --

00:11:50.363 --> 00:11:54.995
is the importance of bringing diverse
and eclectic folks together.

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:57.131
If you want to change the world,

00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:01.427
it helps to have a good cross-section
of society on your side.

00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:04.027
In both the case of guns and drugs,

00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:07.463
we brought together
a wonderful mix of people.

00:12:07.463 --> 00:12:11.667
We mobilized the elite
and got huge support from the media.

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:16.124
We gathered the victims,
human rights champions, cultural icons.

00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.701
We also assembled
the professional classes --

00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.697
doctors, lawyers, academia and more.

00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:24.437
What I've learned over the last years

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:30.337
is that you need coalitions of the willing
and of the unwilling to make change.

00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:32.204
In the case of drugs,

00:12:32.204 --> 00:12:35.791
we needed libertarians,
anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,

00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:38.136
and liberal politicians.

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:40.597
They may not agree on everything;

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:44.846
in fact, they disagree
on almost everything.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:50.615
But the legitimacy of the campaign
is based on their diverse points of view.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.762
Over a decade ago,

00:12:53.762 --> 00:12:58.220
I had a comfortable future
working for an investment bank.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.492
I was as far removed from the world
of civil society diplomacy

00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:04.768
as you can imagine.

00:13:04.768 --> 00:13:06.927
But I took a chance.

00:13:06.927 --> 00:13:08.924
I changed course,

00:13:08.924 --> 00:13:12.284
and on the way, I helped 
to create social movements

00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:17.004
that I believe have made 
some parts of the world safer.

00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:22.178
Each and every one of us
has the power to change the world.

00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:26.790
No matter what the issue,
and no matter how hard the fight,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.504
civil society is central
to the blueprint for change.

00:13:31.504 --> 00:13:33.815
Thank you.

00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:37.832
(Applause)
