00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.058
(Non English)

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:44.200
(French) Mais Des fois on peut voir
parce Que Les gens

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:46.531
ici faire Des choses on peut manger.

00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:50.529
(French) Mais quand
tu es fâché avec quelqu'un

00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:52.421
c'est pas passé the first time.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.714
(British English) And that's one
of the things that I enjoy most

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:58.445
about this convention.

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:05.791
It's not so much, as so little
has to do with what everything is.

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.967
(Laughter)

00:01:09.988 --> 00:01:12.098
But it is within our self-interest

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:15.052
to understand the topography of our lives

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:16.470
unto ourselves.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:21.111
(Laughter)

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:25.195
The future states that there is no time

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.521
other than the collapsation
of that sensation

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:31.167
of the mirror of the memories
in which we are living.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.543
(Laughter)

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.404
Common knowledge,

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.944
but important nonetheless.

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.358
(Laughter)

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.716
As we face fear in these times,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.750
and fear is all around us,

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:47.638
we also have anti-fear.

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:50.822
It's hard to imagine or measure.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:53.942
The background radiation
is simply too static

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:57.469
to be able to be seen
under the normal spectral analysis.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.029
(American accent) But we feel
as though there are times

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:03.506
when a lot of us --
you know what I'm saying?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.374
But -- you know what I'm saying?

00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:07.937
Because, as a hip hop thing,
you know what I'm saying,

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.222
TED be rocking --
you know what I'm saying.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:13.148
Like so I wrote a song,

00:02:13.172 --> 00:02:15.250
and I hope you guys dig it.

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:17.496
It's a song about people

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.273
and sasquatches --

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.551
(Laughter)

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.036
And other French science stuff.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.123
That's French science.

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.290
Okay, here we go.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.469
(Singing) I've been trying inside

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.881
I know that I'm in trouble

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:44.215
(Applause)

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.202
that I'm in trouble

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.098
by myself

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.015
But every time it gets me

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:05.744
(Vocalization)

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:10.553
(Beatbox)

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.745
(Singing) And I've been trying
to be the one that you believe in

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.142
And you're the one
that I want to be so saucy

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:53.957
And you're the one
I want to [unclear], baby

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.422
And you can do anything

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:59.295
as long as you don't get hurt
along the way back

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.675
(Beatbox)

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.621
If I survive, I'm going
to tell you what is wrong

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.304
Because if you were [unclear]

00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:16.058
And I think that you're looking
like a [unclear]

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:21.342
I give you what I want to be

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.805
(Music)

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.480
(Music ends abruptly)

00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:38.456
(British accent) And it's like,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.322
you could use as many
of those things that you want.

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:45.768
(Applause)

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:47.410
And the computer models,

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:48.968
no matter how many that you have

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:50.564
and how many people that you use,

00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:53.501
are never going to be able to arrive
at the same conclusions.

00:04:54.372 --> 00:04:58.004
Four years ago I worked with a few people
at the Brookings Institute,

00:04:58.028 --> 00:04:59.691
and I arrived at a conclusion.

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:05.459
(Laughter)

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:09.222
Tomorrow is another day.

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:11.938
(Laughter)

00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:13.661
Not just any day,

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:14.962
but it is a day.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.471
It will get here, there's no question.

00:05:19.613 --> 00:05:21.692
And the important thing to remember

00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:24.887
is that this simulation is a good one.

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:27.976
It's believable, it's tactile.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.881
You can reach out -- things are solid.

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.394
You can move objects
from one area to another.

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:34.664
You can feel your body.

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:37.142
You can say, "I'd like to go over
to this location,"

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.377
and you can move this mass
of molecules through the air

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:42.347
over to another location, at will.

00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:45.837
(Laughter)

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.396
That's something
you live inside of every day.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.032
Now with the allocation
and the understanding

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.506
of the lack of understanding,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.097
we enter into a new era of science

00:05:57.121 --> 00:05:59.733
in which we feel nothing more

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:01.986
than so much so as to say

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.112
that those within themselves,

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:07.224
comporary or non-comporary,

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:08.749
will figuratively figure

00:06:08.773 --> 00:06:11.997
into the folding of our non-understanding

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:13.858
and our partial understanding

00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:17.145
to the networks
of which we all draw our source

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.467
and conclusions from.

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.034
(Laughter)

00:06:20.058 --> 00:06:23.672
So, as I say before the last piece,

00:06:25.132 --> 00:06:28.537
feel not as though
it is a sphere we live on,

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:32.609
rather an infinite plane
which has the illusion

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:35.293
of leading yourself
back to the point of origin.

00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:36.650
(Laughter)

00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:39.009
Once we understand
that all the spheres in the sky

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:41.102
are just large infinite planes,

00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:42.548
it will be plain to see.

00:06:42.572 --> 00:06:43.573
(Laughter)

00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:45.706
(Audience) (Laughter)

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.199
This is my final piece.

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.188
And just remember,

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.058
everything you are --

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:55.828
it's more important to realize
the negative space,

00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:58.734
as music is only the division of space;

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:01.766
it is the space
we are listening to divided as such,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.395
which gives us the information
in comparison to something other

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.137
that gives us the idea of what the idea
that wants to be transmitted

00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:10.211
wants to be.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:11.853
So please, without further ado.

00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:13.917
(Applause)

00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.017
Thank you.

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:17.193
(Applause)

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:21.093
This is a fun one.

00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:22.131
It goes like this.

00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:25.474
(Beatbox)

00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:31.727
(Gibberish)

00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:48.541
(Music ends)

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.716
Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.166
this one goes very similar to this.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.591
I hope you guys recognize it.

00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:55.630
Here we go.

00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:03.032
Okay, that still works. Okay, good.

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:04.110
All right, here we go.

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:06.096
(Laughter)

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:10.252
(Beatbox)

00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:20.216
Here we go.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.302
(Beatbox)

00:08:28.597 --> 00:08:31.755
Yeah, yo, yo, yo

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.985
(Gibberish)

00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:20.150
(Music fades out)

00:09:20.714 --> 00:09:22.453
Thank you. Enjoy the rest.

00:09:22.477 --> 00:09:25.210
(Applause)
