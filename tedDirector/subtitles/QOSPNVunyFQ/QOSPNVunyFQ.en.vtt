00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.330
Interestingly, Charles Darwin

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
was born a very lightly pigmented man,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.330
in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
Over the course of his life,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
Darwin had great privilege.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
He lived in a fairly wealthy home.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
And when he was in his 20s

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
he embarked upon a remarkable voyage 
on the ship the Beagle.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
And during the course of that voyage,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
he saw remarkable things:

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.330
tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
And the observations that he made

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
on that epic journey

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
were to be eventually distilled

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,"

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
published 150 years ago.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
Now what is so interesting

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
about "The Origin of Species,"

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
is that there is only one line in it

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
about human evolution.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
"Light will be thrown on the origin of man

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
and his history."

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
It wasn't until much longer,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
much later,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
that Darwin actually spoke

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
and wrote about humans.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
Now in his years of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
traveling on the Beagle,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
and from listening to the accounts

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
or explorers and naturalists,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.330
he knew that skin color

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
was one of the most important ways

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
in which people varied.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
were found close to the equator;

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
lightly pigmented peoples, like himself,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
were found closer to the poles.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
So what did he make of all this?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
But much later, in 1871,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
he did have something to say about it.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And it was quite curious. He said,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
"Of all the differences between the races of men,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
the color of the skin is the most conspicuous

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
and one of the best marked."

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
And he went on to say,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
"These differences do not coincide

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
with corresponding differences in climate."

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
So he had traveled all around.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
He had seen people of different colors

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
living in different places.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
And yet he rejected the idea

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
that human skin pigmentation

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.330
was related to the climate.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
If only Darwin lived today.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.330
If only Darwin had NASA.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
is it puts up a variety of satellites

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
And for many decades now

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
there have been a series of TOMS satellites

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.330
The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
show the annual average

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
Now the really hot pink and red areas

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
of UV during the year.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
The incrementally cooler colors --

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays --

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.330
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.330
is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.330
is in these cool gray zones.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
This has tremendous implications for our understanding

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
And what Darwin could not appreciate,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
is that there was a fundamental relationship

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and skin pigmentation.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
And that skin pigmentation itself

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
was a product of evolution.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
And so when we look at a map of skin color,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
and predicted skin color, as we know it today,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
what we see is a beautiful gradient

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
and the lightest ones toward the poles.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
What's very, very important here

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
is that the earliest humans

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
evolved in high-UV environments,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
in equatorial Africa.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
The earliest members of our lineage,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
And we all share this incredible heritage

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
of having originally been

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
darkly pigmented,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
two million to one and half million years ago.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.330
Now what happened in our history?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
Let's first look at the relationship

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
In those early days of our evolution,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
looking at the equator,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
The UVC, the most energetic type,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
But UVB and UVA

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
especially, came in unimpeded.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.330
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
It's very destructive,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.330
vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.330
for our strong bones, the health of our immune system,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
and myriad other important functions in our bodies.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
So, living at the equator, we got

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.330
and the melanin --

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.330
this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
compound in our skin --

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.330
served as a superb natural sunscreen.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
This polymer is amazing

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
because it's present in so many different organisms.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
a billion years,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
and has been recruited over and over again

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.330
by evolution, as often happens.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Why change it if it works?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
and specifically in our earliest ancestors

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
evolving in Africa,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
to be a natural sunscreen.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Where it protected the body

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.330
against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
the destruction, or damage to DNA,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330
and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
which helps to fuel cell production,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
and reproduction in the body.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
wonderful covering of melanin.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.330
But then we moved.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.330
from Africa into other parts of the Old World,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and most recently, into the New World.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
When humans dispersed into these latitudes,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.330
what did they face?

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Conditions were significantly colder,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
but they were also less intense

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
with respect to the ultraviolet regime.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.330
So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
We're still getting a dose of UVA.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
But all of the UVB,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
or nearly all of it,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
you may experience ultraviolet radiation.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
But it's all UVA,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
and, significantly, that UVA

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.330
has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
were bereft of the potential

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
This had tremendous consequences

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.330
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
these lineages of people

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.330
dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
lost their pigmentation.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
There was natural selection

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.330
for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
Here we begin to see the evolution

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
of the beautiful sepia rainbow

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
that now characterizes all of humanity.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.330
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
not just twice, but probably three times.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
Not just in modern humans,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
the Neanderthals.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
A remarkable, remarkable testament

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
to the power of evolution.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
Humans have been on the move for a long time.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
And just in the last 5,000 years,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
in increasing rates, over increasing distances.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
people from high UV areas

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
going to low UV and vice versa.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.330
And not all these moves were voluntary.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
Between 1520 and 1867,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.330
12 million, 500 people

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
were moved from high UV

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
to low UV areas

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
in the transatlantic slave trade.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
But it also had deleterious

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
health consequences to people.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
So what? We've been on the move.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
We're so clever we can overcome all of these

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
seeming biological impediments.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
Well, often we're unaware

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.330
of the fact that we're living

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
in environments in which our skin

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
is inherently poorly adapted.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
live in high-UV areas.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
live in low-UV areas.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
These have tremendous consequences for our health.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
We have to, if we're lightly pigmented,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.330
be careful about the problems of skin cancer,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.330
and destruction of folate in our bodies,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
by lots of sun.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
Epidemiologists and doctors

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
have been very good about telling us

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
about protecting our skin.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
What they haven't been so good about instructing people

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
is the problem of darkly pigmented people

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
living in high latitude areas,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.330
or working inside all the time.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
Because the problem there is just as severe,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.330
but it is more sinister,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
because vitamin D deficiency,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.330
from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
is a major problem.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.330
to their gradual decay of their immune systems,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
or loss of immune function,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
and probably some problems

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
with their mood and health,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
their mental health.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
So we have, in skin pigmentation,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.330
one of these wonderful products of evolution

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
that still has consequences for us today.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
And the social consequences,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
as we know, are incredibly profound.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
We live in a world where we

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.330
have lightly and darkly pigmented people

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
living next to one another,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
but often brought into proximity initially

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.330
as a result of very invidious social interactions.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
So how can we overcome this?

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
How can we begin to understand it?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.330
Evolution helps us.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.330
200 years after Darwin's birthday,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:13.330
we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.330
(Applause)

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
How wonderful is that?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
(Applause)

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.330
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
But we need to think about how he compares,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.330
He, as one of many urban admixed populations,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
is very emblematic

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.330
And he resembles, very closely,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
people with moderate levels of pigmentation

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
These people have a tremendous potential

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.330
to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
as a result of exposure to sun.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.330
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.330
if they have desk jobs, like that guy.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.330
So lets all wish for his great health,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.330
and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
Now what is wonderful

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.330
about the evolution of human skin pigmentation,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
and the phenomenon of pigmentation,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330
is that it is the demonstration,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.330
the evidence, of evolution

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
by natural selection,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.330
right on your body.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.330
You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
You just have to look at your skin.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
even though he eschewed the importance

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.330
of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
I think, were he able to look

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
He would appreciate it.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
And most of all, he would teach it.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
You, you can teach it.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.330
You can touch it.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
You can understand it.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
Take it out of this room.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
Take your skin color,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
and celebrate it.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
Spread the word.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
You have the evolution

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.330
of the history of our species,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
part of it, written in your skin.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.330
Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
You are the products of evolution.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
Thank you.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.330
(Applause)
