00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
to anywhere in the world.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
about that transformation.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
You probably read something about it in the papers.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
there might be voter suppression.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And so a plan came up to video the vote.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
And the idea was that individual citizens

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
with phones capable of taking photos or making video

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
would document their polling places,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and would upload this to a central place.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
What matters here

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
isn't technical capital,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
it's social capital.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
These tools don't get socially interesting

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
until they get technologically boring.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
that their uses start permeating society.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
Because now that media is increasingly social,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
innovation can happen anywhere

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And so we're starting to see a media landscape

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
in which innovation is happening everywhere,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
and moving from one spot to another.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
That is a huge transformation.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
the moment our historical generation is living through --

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
is the largest increase in expressive capability

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
in human history.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.160
There are only four periods in the last 500 years

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
The first one is the famous one, the printing press:

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
that made printing possible

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Then, a couple of hundred years ago,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
there was innovation in two-way communication,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Slow, text-based conversations,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
then real-time voice based conversations.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Then, about 150 years ago,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
first photos, then recorded sound,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
This is what those of us of a certain age

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
grew up with, and are used to.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
But there is a curious asymmetry here.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
The media that is good at creating conversations

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
is no good at creating groups.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
And the media that's good at creating groups

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
is no good at creating conversations.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
If you want to have a conversation

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
in this world, you have it with one other person.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
If you want to address a group, you get the same message

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
and you give it to everybody in the group,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160
whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
That was the media landscape

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
as we had it in the twentieth century.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And this is what changed.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
He traces the edges of the individual networks

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
and then color codes them.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
The Internet is the first medium in history

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
that has native support for groups

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
and conversation at the same time.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
and television, radio, magazines, books,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
gave us the one-to-many pattern,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
For the first time,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
That's one of the big changes.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
The second big change

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
is that, as all media gets digitized,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
for all other media,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And that means that every medium

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.160
is right next door to every other medium.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Put another way,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
media is increasingly less just a source of information,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
can now gather around and talk to each other as well.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
And the third big change

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
can now also be producers and not consumers.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Every time a new consumer

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
joins this media landscape

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
a new producer joins as well,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
because the same equipment --

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
phones, computers --

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
let you consume and produce.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
if you pressed the right buttons.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
That is a huge change

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
in the media landscape we're used to.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
We've had the Internet in its public form

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
for almost 20 years now,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
and it's still changing

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
as the media becomes more social.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
It's still changing patterns

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Second story.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Last May, China in the Sichuan province

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.160
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
They were taking videos of buildings shaking.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
They were Twittering it.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
And so as the quake was happening

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
the news was reported.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
And because of the social connections,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.160
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Twitter announced the existence of the quake

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
several minutes before the US Geological Survey

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.160
had anything up online for anybody to read.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
it took them three months to admit that it had happened.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160
(Laughter)

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
Now they might have liked to have done that here,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
rather than seeing these pictures go up online.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
But they weren't given that choice,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
because their own citizens beat them to the punch.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
For a while there

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
the global short messaging service --

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
People collating information,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
pointing people to news sources,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
pointing people to the US geological survey.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160
(Laughter)

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And within half a day donation sites were up,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.160
and donations were pouring in from all around the world.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.160
This was an incredible, coordinated global response.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
decided that they were going to let it go,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.160
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
And then this happened.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
the reason so many school buildings collapsed

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
is that corrupt officials had taken bribes

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
to allow those building to be built to less than code.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
And so they started, the citizen journalists started

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
in front of these protesters,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
in order to get them to go away.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
just please stop protesting in public."

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
But these are people who have been radicalized,

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
because, thanks to the one child policy,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
they have lost everyone in their next generation.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
Someone who has seen the death of a single child

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
now has nothing to lose.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
And so the protest kept going.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
And finally the Chinese cracked down.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
That was enough of citizen media.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
And so they began to arrest the protesters.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
China is probably the most successful

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
manager of Internet censorship in the world,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
And the Great Firewall of China

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
is a set of observation points

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
that assume that media is produced by professionals,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
it mostly comes in from the outside world,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
it comes in relatively sparse chunks,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
and it comes in relatively slowly.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
And because of those four characteristics

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
But like the Maginot Line,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
for this challenge,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.160
because not one of those four things was true in this environment.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.160
It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
has quite successfully filtered the web,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
is now in the position of having to decide

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
whether to allow or shut down entire services,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
because the transformation to amateur media

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
And in fact that is happening this week.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
they just, two days ago, announced

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
because there was no way to filter it other than that.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.160
They had to turn the spigot entirely off.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
They also affect people who want to send messages,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
not just a particular strategy.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
The classic media problem, from the 20th century

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
is, how does an organization have a message

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
that they want to get out

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And here is the twentieth century answer.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.160
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
National message. Targeted individuals.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
Relatively sparse number of producers.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Very expensive to do,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
so there is not a lot of competition.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
This is how you reach people.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
All of that is over.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
social, ubiquitous and cheap.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
are now used to this change.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
The audience can talk back.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.160
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
The really crazy change is here:

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
the fact that former consumers are now producers,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
and because the size of the network,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
the complexity of the network is actually the square

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
of the number of participants,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
meaning that the network, when it grows large,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
grows very, very large.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
As recently at last decade,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
most of the media that was available for public consumption

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
was produced by professionals.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160
Those days are over, never to return.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
which brings me to my last story.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
We saw some of the most imaginative use

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
of social media during the Obama campaign.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics --

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
I mean most imaginative use ever.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
and to try and figure out how to help.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
An incredible conversation sprung up there.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
And then, this time last year,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
on American persons.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
I'm going to vote for this bill."

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And many of his own supporters

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.160
on his own site went very publicly berserk.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
"Please get FISA right."

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Within days of this group being created

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
Obama had to issue a press release.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
He had to issue a reply.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
I understand where you are coming from.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.160
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.160
and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
People in that group realized

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.160
that Obama had never shut them down.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
or make it harder to join,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
to deny its existence, to delete it,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
to take to off the site.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
They had understood that their role

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160
with myBO.com was to convene their supporters

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
but not to control their supporters.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
And that is the kind of discipline

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
that it takes to make really mature use

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
of this media.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.160
Media, the media landscape that we knew,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160
to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
messages to amateurs,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.160
is increasingly slipping away.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
in a world of media where the former audience

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.160
are now increasingly full participants,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160
in that world, media is less and less often

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
about crafting a single message

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
to be consumed by individuals.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
It is more and more often

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160
a way of creating an environment for convening

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
and supporting groups.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
And the choice we face,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
anywhere in the world,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
That's the media environment we've got.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
The question we all face now is,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
"How can we make best use of this media?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.160
Even though it means changing the way we've always done it."

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
Thank you very much.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.160
(Applause)
