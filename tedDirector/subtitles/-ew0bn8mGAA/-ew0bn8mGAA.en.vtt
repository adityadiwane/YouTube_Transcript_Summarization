00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.936
The problem I want to talk with you
about is really the problem of:

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.766
How does one supply health care
in a world in which cost is everything?

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:29.511
How do you do that?

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:32.794
And the basic paradigm
we want to suggest to you,

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:34.043
I want to suggest to you,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.739
is one in which you say
that in order to treat disease,

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:41.135
you have to first know
what you're treating, that's diagnostics,

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.806
and then you have to do something.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.146
The program we're involved in is something
we call "Diagnostics for All,"

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.281
or "zero-cost diagnostics."

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:52.719
How do you provide medically
relevant information

00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:55.367
at as close as possible to zero cost?

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:56.621
How do you do it?

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.436
Let me just give you two examples.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:04.833
The rigors of military medicine are not
so dissimilar from the third world:

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:09.209
poor resources, a rigorous environment --
a series of problems --

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.214
light weight and things of this kind.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.672
And also they're not so different
from the home health care

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.101
and diagnostic system world.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.973
So, the technology I want to talk
about is for the third world,

00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:23.395
for the developing world,

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:25.960
but it has, I think,
much broader application,

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:29.447
because information is so important
in the health care system.

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.095
So you see two examples here.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.868
One is a lab that is actually
a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:42.196
The second is basically an entrepreneur
who is set up and doing who-knows-what

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.667
at a table in a market.

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:46.638
I don't know what kind
of health care is delivered there.

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:50.514
But it's not really
what is probably most efficient.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.234
What is our approach?

00:01:54.702 --> 00:02:00.227
The way in which one typically
approaches a problem of lowering cost,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.114
starting from the perspective
of the United States,

00:02:03.138 --> 00:02:05.281
is to take our solution,

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.460
and then try to cut cost out of it.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:09.436
No matter how you do that,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.966
you're not going to start
with a $100,000 instrument

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.411
and bring it down to no cost.

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:14.608
It isn't going to work.

00:02:14.632 --> 00:02:17.491
So the approach we took
was the other way around, to ask:

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.980
What is the cheapest possible stuff

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.940
that you could make
a diagnostic system out of,

00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:25.511
and get useful information
and add function?

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.532
And what we've chosen is paper.

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.580
What you see here is a prototypic device.

00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:32.436
It's about a centimeter on the side.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.437
It's about the size of a fingernail.

00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.064
The lines around the edges are a polymer.

00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:39.930
It's made of paper.

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:44.639
And paper, of course, wicks fluid,
as you know, paper, cloth --

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.539
drop wine on the tablecloth,

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:49.300
and the wine wicks all over everything.

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:51.363
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.126
That's what a hydrophilic surface does.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.773
So in this device, the idea
is that you drip the bottom end of it

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:00.436
in a drop of, in this case, urine.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.208
The fluid wicks its way
into those chambers at the top.

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:08.436
The brown color indicates
the amount of glucose in the urine,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.007
the blue color indicates the amount
of protein in the urine.

00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:15.067
And the combination of those two
is a first-order shot

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.213
at a number of useful things
that you want.

00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:21.594
So, this is an example of a device
made from a simple piece of paper.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.878
Now, how simple can you make
the production?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.225
Why do we choose paper?

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.629
There's an example
of the same thing on a finger,

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:31.909
showing you basically what it looks like.

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:34.361
One reason for using paper
is that it's everywhere.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:39.558
We have made these kinds of devices
using napkins and toilet paper

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.812
and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:44.274
So the production capability is there.

00:03:44.298 --> 00:03:48.595
The second is, you can put lots and lots
of tests in a very small place.

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.438
I'll show you in a moment
that the stack of paper there

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.194
would probably hold
something like 100,000 tests,

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:55.959
something of that kind.

00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.828
And then finally, a point
you don't think of so much

00:03:58.852 --> 00:04:01.436
in developed world medicine:

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.139
it eliminates sharps.

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:06.545
And what sharps means
is needles, things that stick.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.863
If you've taken a sample
of someone's blood

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:11.384
and the someone might have hepatitis C,

00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:13.955
you don't want to make a mistake
and stick it in you.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.276
You don't want to do that.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.789
So how do you dispose of that?

00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:19.495
It's a problem everywhere,
and here, you simply burn it.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.019
So it's a sort of a practical approach
to starting on things.

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:28.333
Now, you say, "If paper is a good idea,

00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:30.320
other people have surely thought of it."

00:04:30.344 --> 00:04:32.226
And the answer is, of course, yes.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.070
Those half of you, roughly, who are women,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:38.556
at some point may have had
a pregnancy test.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.564
And the most common of these
is in a device

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:44.436
that looks like the thing on the left.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.952
It's something called
a lateral-flow immunoassay.

00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:48.436
In that particular test,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.075
urine, either containing
a hormone called hCG,

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.436
does or does not flow
across a piece of paper.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.361
And there are two bars; one bar
indicates that the test is working,

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:02.550
and if the second bar shows up,
you're pregnant.

00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:05.745
This is a terrific kind of test
in a binary world,

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:08.684
and the nice thing about pregnancy
is either you are pregnant

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:09.862
or you're not pregnant;

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.867
you're not partially pregnant
or thinking about being pregnant

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:14.175
or something of that sort.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.934
So it works very well there,
but it doesn't work very well

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.044
when you need more
quantitative information.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:20.288
There are also dipsticks,

00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:22.058
but if you look at the dipsticks,

00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:24.295
they're for another kind
of urine analysis.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.196
There are an awful lot of colors
and things like that.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.513
What do you actually do about that
in a difficult circumstance?

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:35.941
So the approach we started with is to ask:

00:05:35.965 --> 00:05:39.436
Is it really practical
to make things of this sort?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.747
And that problem is now,
in a purely engineering way, solved.

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:47.320
And the procedure that we have
is simply to start with paper.

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:50.890
You run it through a new kind
of printer called a wax printer.

00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:53.546
The wax printer does
what looks like printing.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.728
It is printing.

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:56.792
You put that on, you warm it a little bit,

00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:59.859
the wax prints through,
so it absorbs into the paper,

00:05:59.883 --> 00:06:02.027
and you end up with the device you want.

00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:05.130
The printers cost 800 bucks now.

00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:09.042
We estimate that if you were
to run them 24 hours a day,

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:11.174
they'd make about 10 million tests a year.

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:14.422
So it's a solved problem.
That particular problem is solved.

00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:17.222
And there is an example
of the kind of thing that you see.

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.085
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:21.378
That takes about two seconds to make.

00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:24.044
And so I regard that as done.

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:25.862
There's a very important issue here,

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.304
which is that because it's a printer,
a color printer, it prints colors.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:31.852
That's what color printers do.

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:34.642
I'll show you in a moment,
that's actually quite useful.

00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:38.436
Now, the next question
that you would like to ask is:

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.651
What would you like to measure?
What would you like to analyze?

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:46.436
And the thing you'd most like to analyze,
we're a fair distance from.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.436
It's what's called
"fever of undiagnosed origin."

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.021
Someone comes into the clinic,
they have a fever, they feel bad.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:55.211
What do they have?

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:58.637
Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS?
Do they have a common cold?

00:06:58.661 --> 00:06:59.875
The triage problem.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.555
That's a hard problem for reasons
I won't go through.

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.121
There are an awful lot of things
that you'd like to distinguish among.

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:08.347
But then there are a series of things --

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.955
AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.474
and simpler ones,
such as guidance of treatment.

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:18.436
Now, even that's more
complicated than you think.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.675
A friend of mine works
in transcultural psychiatry,

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.805
and he is interested in the question

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:27.559
of why people do
and don't take their meds.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:31.158
So Dapsone, or something like that,
you have to take for a while.

00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:34.798
He has a wonderful story
of talking to a villager in India

00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:35.973
and saying,

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.803
"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."

00:07:37.827 --> 00:07:39.693
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."

00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:41.671
"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:43.196
What the guy actually meant

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.122
was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone
to his dog that morning.

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.271
(Laughter)

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:52.051
And he was telling the truth,
because in a different culture,

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:54.649
the dog is a surrogate for you;

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:57.816
"today," "this month,"
"since the rainy season" --

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.324
there are lots of opportunities
for misunderstanding.

00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:01.355
(Laughter)

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:04.943
And so an issue here is to,
in some cases, figure out

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:09.078
how to deal with matters
that seem uninteresting, like compliance.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.965
Now, take a look
at what a typical test looks like.

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:18.436
Prick a finger, you get some blood --
about 50 microliters.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.291
That's about all you're going to get,

00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:24.291
because you can't use
the usual sort of systems.

00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:26.519
You can't manipulate it very well;

00:08:26.543 --> 00:08:28.659
I'll show something
about that in a moment.

00:08:28.683 --> 00:08:31.436
So you take the drop of blood,
no further manipulations,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.243
you put it on a little device,

00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:37.940
the device filters out the blood cells,
lets the serum go through,

00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:41.725
and you get a series of colors
down in the bottom there.

00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:45.908
And the colors indicate
"disease" or "normal."

00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:47.614
But even that's complicated,

00:08:47.638 --> 00:08:51.239
because to me, colors
might indicate "normal,"

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:56.223
but after all, we're all suffering
from probably an excess of education.

00:08:56.247 --> 00:09:00.834
What do you do about something
which requires quantitative analysis?

00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:03.540
And so the solution
that we and many other people

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:05.175
are thinking about there,

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:07.788
and at this point,
there is a dramatic flourish,

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:10.984
and out comes the universal solution
to everything these days,

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:12.165
which is a cell phone --

00:09:12.189 --> 00:09:14.187
in this particular case, a camera phone.

00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:18.436
They're everywhere --
six billion a month in India.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.982
And the idea is that what one does
is to take the device,

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:26.436
you dip it, you develop the color,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.685
you take a picture,
the picture goes to a central laboratory.

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:31.436
You don't have to send out a doctor,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.201
you send out somebody
who can just take the sample,

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:37.950
and in the clinic either a doctor,
or ideally, a computer in this case,

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:39.138
does the analysis.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.013
Turns out to work actually quite well,

00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:44.129
particularly when your color printer
has printed the color bars

00:09:44.153 --> 00:09:45.974
that indicate how things work.

00:09:45.998 --> 00:09:49.022
So my view of the health care
worker of the future

00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:51.613
is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,

00:09:51.637 --> 00:09:54.389
otherwise unemployed, who has two things:

00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:56.496
a backpack full
of these tests and a lancet

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.436
to occasionally take a blood sample,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.019
and an AK-47.

00:10:00.043 --> 00:10:02.639
And these are the things
that get him through his day.

00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:04.211
(Laughter)

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.707
There's another very
interesting connection here,

00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:13.271
and that is, that what one wants to do
is pass through useful information

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:16.826
over what is generally
a pretty awful telephone system.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.436
It turns out there's an enormous
amount of information

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.839
already available on that subject,
which is the Mars Rover problem.

00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:26.730
How do you get back an accurate view
of the color on Mars

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:30.540
if you have a really terrible
bandwidth to do it with?

00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:32.436
And the answer is not complicated,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.001
but it's one which I don't want
to go through here,

00:10:35.025 --> 00:10:38.069
other than to say that the communication
systems for doing this

00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:39.794
are really pretty well understood.

00:10:39.818 --> 00:10:42.555
Also, a fact which you may not know

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:46.313
is that the compute capability
of this thing is not so different

00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:49.176
from the compute capability
of your desktop computer.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.861
This is a fantastic device
which is only beginning to be tapped.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:56.331
I don't know whether the idea
of one computer, one child

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.506
makes any sense.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.436
Here's the computer of the future,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.661
because this screen is already there
and they're ubiquitous.

00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:07.348
All right, let me show you just
a little bit about advanced devices.

00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:09.526
And we'll start by posing
a little problem.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.947
What you see here
is another centimeter-sized device,

00:11:12.971 --> 00:11:16.954
and the different colors
are different colors of dye.

00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:18.156
And you notice something

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.879
which might strike you
as a little bit interesting,

00:11:20.903 --> 00:11:23.760
which is, the yellow seems to disappear,

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:26.273
get through the blue,
and then get through the red.

00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:27.450
How does that happen?

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:30.049
How do you make something
flow through something?

00:11:30.073 --> 00:11:32.268
And, of course the answer is, "You don't."

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.035
You make it flow under and over.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:35.220
But now the question is:

00:11:35.244 --> 00:11:38.786
How do you make it flow
under and over in a piece of paper?

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.756
The answer is that what you do --

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.436
and the details are not
terribly important here --

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.351
is to make something more elaborate:

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:48.452
You take several different
layers of paper,

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:51.547
each one containing
its own little fluid system,

00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:56.160
and you separate them by pieces of,
literally, double-sided carpet tape,

00:11:56.184 --> 00:11:59.070
the stuff you use to stick
the carpets onto the floor.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:02.320
And the fluid will flow
from one layer into the next.

00:12:02.344 --> 00:12:05.436
It distributes itself,
flows through further holes,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.049
distributes itself.

00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:10.314
And what you see,
at the lower right-hand side there,

00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:15.637
is a sample in which a single sample
of blood has been put on the top,

00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:18.171
and it has gone through
and distributed itself

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:21.541
into these 16 holes on the bottom,

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:24.269
in a piece of paper --
basically, it looks like a chip,

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:26.031
two pieces of paper thick.

00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:27.538
And in this particular case,

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:30.326
we were just interested
in the replicability of that.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.654
But that is, in principle,
the way you solve

00:12:32.678 --> 00:12:34.834
the "fever of unexplained origin" problem,

00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:37.614
because each one of those spots
then becomes a test

00:12:37.638 --> 00:12:41.237
for a particular set
of markers of disease,

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.527
and this will work in due course.

00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:46.867
Here is an example of a slightly
more complicated device.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.073
There's the chip.

00:12:48.097 --> 00:12:49.313
You dip in a corner.

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:50.884
The fluid goes into the center.

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:54.691
It distributes itself out
into these various wells or holes

00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:55.951
and turns color,

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:58.668
all done with paper and carpet tape.

00:12:58.692 --> 00:13:00.849
So it's, I think, as low-cost

00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:03.700
as we're likely to be able
to come up and make things.

00:13:04.692 --> 00:13:07.988
Now, I have two last
little stories to tell you

00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:10.622
in finishing off this business.

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:11.811
This is one:

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:14.276
One of the things
you occasionally need to do

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.947
is separate blood cells from serum.

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:19.819
And the question was,

00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:21.944
here we do it by taking a sample,

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.830
we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,

00:13:25.854 --> 00:13:28.321
and you get blood cells out.

00:13:28.345 --> 00:13:29.504
Terrific.

00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:32.975
What happens if you don't have
electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.515
And we thought for a while
of how you might do this,

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:38.176
and the way, in fact, you do it,
is what's shown here.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.807
You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere,
and you saw off a blade,

00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:45.314
and then you take tubing,
and you stick it on that.

00:13:45.338 --> 00:13:48.078
You put the blood in,
somebody sits there and spins it.

00:13:48.102 --> 00:13:50.221
It works really, really well.

00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:52.659
And we sat down,
we did the physics of eggbeaters

00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:55.760
and self-aligning tubes
and all the rest of that kind of thing,

00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.246
and sent it off to a journal.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.592
We were very proud of this,

00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:01.478
particularly the title,
which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."

00:14:01.502 --> 00:14:02.576
(Laughter)

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.751
And we sent it off,

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.682
and by return mail, it came back.

00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:07.436
I called up the editor and I said,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.582
"What's going on? How is this possible?"

00:14:09.606 --> 00:14:12.740
The editor said, with enormous disdain,

00:14:12.764 --> 00:14:14.207
"I read this.

00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.987
And we're not going to publish it,
because we only publish science."

00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.424
(Laughter)

00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:20.917
And it's an important issue,

00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:24.339
because it means
that we have to, as a society,

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.340
think about what we value.

00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:29.148
And if it's just papers
and Phys. Rev. letters,

00:14:29.172 --> 00:14:30.415
we've got a problem.

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:34.308
Here is another example
of something which is --

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.373
this is a little spectrophotometer.

00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:39.687
It measures the absorption
of light in a sample.

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.190
The neat thing about this is,

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.905
you have a light source that flickers
on and off at about 1,000 hertz,

00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:48.598
another light source
that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:51.436
and so you can run this system
in broad daylight.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.529
It performs about equivalently

00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:58.122
to a system that's on the order
of 100,000 dollars.

00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:59.307
It costs 50 dollars.

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:03.436
We can probably make it for 50 cents
if we put our mind to it.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.333
Why doesn't somebody do it?

00:15:05.357 --> 00:15:06.508
The answer is:

00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:09.802
How do you make a profit
in a capitalist system, doing that?

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.118
Interesting problem.

00:15:12.575 --> 00:15:17.528
So, let me finish by saying
that we've thought about this

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:19.754
as a kind of engineering problem.

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:24.160
And we've asked: What
is the scientific unifying idea here?

00:15:24.184 --> 00:15:26.308
And we've decided
we should think about this

00:15:26.332 --> 00:15:29.436
not so much in terms of cost,
but in terms of simplicity.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.038
Simplicity is a neat word.

00:15:31.062 --> 00:15:33.436
You've got to think
about what simplicity means.

00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:35.171
I know what it is,

00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:37.372
but I don't actually know what it means.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:39.493
So I actually was interested
enough in this

00:15:39.517 --> 00:15:43.270
to put together several groups of people.

00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:46.436
The most recent involved
a couple of people at MIT,

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.580
one of them being
an exceptionally bright kid

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:51.314
who is one of the very
few people I would think of

00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:52.727
who's an authentic genius.

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:56.801
We all struggled for an entire day
to think about simplicity.

00:15:56.825 --> 00:16:01.007
And I want to give you the answer
of this deep scientific thought.

00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:02.364
[What is simplicity?

00:16:02.388 --> 00:16:03.975
"It's impossible to f..k it up"]

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:05.048
(Laughter)

00:16:05.072 --> 00:16:07.522
So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:09.055
Thank you very much.

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:11.164
(Applause)
