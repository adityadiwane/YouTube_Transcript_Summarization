00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
The public debate about architecture

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.160
quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
the architectural object.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Is the latest tower in London

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
a gherkin or a sausage

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
or a sex tool?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
So recently, we asked ourselves

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
if we could invent a format

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
maybe combining images and drawings and words

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
it already existed in the form of a comic book.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
So we basically copied the format of the comic book

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
how our projects actually evolve through adaptation

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
and improvisation.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
and the incidents of the real world.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
We call this comic book "Yes is More,"

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
He triggered the modernist revolution.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
(Laughter)

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
you could say promiscuity, or at least openness

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
to new ideas with, "I am a whore."

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
at a sort of time of global financial crisis.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
is basically trying to question this idea

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
as who or what we are against.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
The cliche of the radical architect

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
this idea that things gradually evolve

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
by adapting and improvising

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
to the changes of the world.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
who best explains our design process.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
His famous evolutionary tree

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
could almost be a diagram of the way we work.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
As you can see, a project evolves through

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
a series of generations of design meetings.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Only the best ones can survive.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And through a process of architectural selection,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
we might choose a really beautiful model

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
or we might have a very functional model.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
And through these sort of generations of design meetings

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
we arrive at a design.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
The design process was really tough,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
almost like a struggle for survival,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
but gradually an idea evolved:

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
this sort of idea of a rational tower

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
that melts together with the surrounding city,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
with the library.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And quite often we sit in a design meeting

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
and we discover that there is this great idea.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160
It doesn't really work in this context.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
But for another client in another culture,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
it could really be the right answer to a different question.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
So as a result, we never throw anything out.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
We keep our office almost like an archive

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
of architectural biodiversity.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
You never know when you might need it.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
And what I'd like to do now, in an act of

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
warp-speed storytelling,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
is tell the story of how two projects evolved

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
by adapting and improvising

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
to the happenstance of the world.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
to do the competition for the Danish

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
And we saw this guy, Haibao.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
He's the mascot of the expo,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
and he looks strangely familiar.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
In fact he looked like a building we had designed

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
for a hotel in the north of Sweden.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
look like something from the north of Sweden.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
who saw our design and said,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
(Laughter)

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
So, apparently this is how you write "people,"

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
as in the People's Republic of China.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
We even double checked.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
so we hired a feng shui master.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
and went to China.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
(Laughter)

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
So the People's Building, as we called it.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
which got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
to visit the exhibition.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160
And we had the chance to explain the project.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
with most skyscrapers,"

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
and the progressive future of China.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
(Laughter)

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
(Applause)

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.160
(Laughter)

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
because he is actually the Chinese character for "people."

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
And they chose this mascot because

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
Sustainability.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
And we thought, sustainability has grown into being

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
this sort of neo-Protestant idea

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
that it has to hurt in order to do good.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
You know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
is less fun than normal life.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
where a sustainable city

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
actually increases the quality of life.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
We also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
that would be relevant?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
China symbolized by the dragon.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
(Laughter)

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
China has many great poets,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
but we discovered that in the People's Republic

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
public school curriculum,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160
It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
integrated into Chinese culture.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
(Laughter)

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Copenhagen, Shanghai,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
modern, European.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
But then we looked at recent urban development,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
A third of all the people commute by bike.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
that you can borrow if you visit the city.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.160
get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
that you can actually swim in it.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
One of the first projects we ever did

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
was the harbor bath in Copenhagen,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
sort of continuing the public realm into the water.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
state financed propaganda,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
images, statements, but no real experience.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
You can try it.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Like with the water, instead of talking about it,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
from Copenhagen to Shanghai,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
and feel how clean it is.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
to sail water from Copenhagen to China.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.160
But in fact, the container ships go

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
full of goods from China to Denmark,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
and then they sail empty back.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.160
So quite often you load water for ballast.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.160
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And when she's gone, we're going to invite

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
of exhibition and bikes.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.160
jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
So when we actually won the competition

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160
with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
and then the Chinese state said,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
"Suggest change to panda."

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
(Laughter)

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
(Applause)

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
move our national monument,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.160
the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
they were discussing the bailout package --

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
And then from 11 to 1,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
(Laughter)

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.160
(Applause)

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
next year, don't come to Copenhagen,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
because she's going to be in Shanghai.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
If you do come to Copenhagen,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
(Laughter)

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
So the second story that I'd like to tell

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
is, actually starts in my own house.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
This is my apartment.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
This is the view from my apartment,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.160
And they form this sort of vertical backyard

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
Trying to zigzag it to make sure

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
that all of the apartments look at the straight views,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
instead of into each other.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
Until recently, this was the view from my apartment,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
next to a parking structure.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
looking straight into a big boring block of cars,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
put them on a podium of cars.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
And because Copenhagen is completely flat,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
you basically have to do it yourself.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Then we sort of cut up the volume,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
(Laughter)

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
underneath the apartments.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.160
like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and a sort of dense urban location.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
This is our first architectural model.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.160
(Laughter)

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160
And the facade of the parking,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
so we needed to perforate it.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
we could actually turn the entire facade

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
into a gigantic, naturally ventilated,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
rasterized image.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160
we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.160
(Applause)

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
So if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
from cars and colors,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
is actually accumulated.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
And there is an automatic irrigation system

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
in one or two years it will sort of transform

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
into a Cambodian temple ruin,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
completely covered in green.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
So, the Mountain is like our first built example

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
then at least added value by mixing

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.160
traditional ingredients, like normal apartments

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
and normal parking,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
and in this case actually offer people

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
the chance that they don't have to choose between

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
a life with a garden or a life in the city.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.160
They can actually have both.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.160
As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
in central Asia,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
because that's not really how you get commissions.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
to the opportunities and accidents that happen,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.160
and the sort of turmoil of the world.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160
One last example is that recently we,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
like last summer, we won the competition

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
to design a Nordic national bank.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.160
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
(Laughter)

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Unfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
At the same time, we actually had a visitor --

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.160
a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
by this idea that you could actually make mountains

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
out of architecture,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.160
because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
So he asked us if we could actually imagine

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
an urban master plan

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
on an island outside the capital

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
of Azerbaijan.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
So we took the commission.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
We quite often make little movies.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
We always argue a lot about the soundtrack,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
So basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
overlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning --

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
almost like the diagram of their flag.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
And our main idea was

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
of the topography of Azerbaijan

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.160
and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
inhabitable of human life.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
Then we place these mountains on the island,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
surrounding this sort of central green valley,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
almost like a central park.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.160
So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160
exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
and to use the thermal properties of water

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
to heat and cool the buildings.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
is filtered organically into the landscape,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160
gradually transforming the desert island

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160
into sort of a green, lush landscape.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.160
So, you can say where an urban development

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
normally happens at the expense of nature,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
in this case it's actually creating nature.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And the buildings, they don't only sort of

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
invoke the imagery of the mountains,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
they also operate like mountains.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
They create shelter from the wind.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
They accumulate the solar energy.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
They accumulate the water.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
So they actually transform the entire island

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.160
into a single ecosystem.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
So we recently presented the master plan,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
and it has gotten approved.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
And this summer we are starting the construction documents

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.160
of the two first mountains,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.160
in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
in Central Asia.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:37.160
(Applause)

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.160
Yes, maybe just to round off.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.160
sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
With a little luck and some more evolution,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160
maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
Thank you.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:05.160
(Applause)
