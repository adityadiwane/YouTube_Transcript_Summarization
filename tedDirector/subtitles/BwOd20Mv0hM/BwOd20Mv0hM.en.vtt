00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
I would like to talk today

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
about what I think is one of the greatest adventures

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
human beings have embarked upon,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
which is the quest to understand the universe

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
and our place in it.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
began rather accidentally.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
I had bought a copy of this book,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
A few years after that, in Bangalore,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
and I picked up this book,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
And as it happened,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
And I was left with this intense feeling

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
of awe and exhilaration

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
at the universe

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
and our own ability to understand as much as we do.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
That feeling was the trigger for me

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
to actually change my career --

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
from being a software engineer to become a science writer --

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
so that I could partake in the joy of science,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
and also the joy of communicating it to others.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
And that feeling also led me

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
to a pilgrimage of sorts,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
to go literally to the ends of the earth

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
to see telescopes, detectors,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
instruments that people are building, or have built,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
in order to probe the cosmos

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
in greater and greater detail.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
So it took me from places like Chile --

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
the Atacama Desert in Chile --

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
to Siberia,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
to underground mines

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
all the way to Antarctica

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and even to the South Pole.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
And today I would like to share with you

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
some images, some stories of these trips.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
I have been basically spending the last few years

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
documenting the efforts

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
of some extremely intrepid men and women

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
who are putting,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
literally at times, their lives at stake

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
working in some very remote and very hostile places

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
in order for us to understand this universe.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
And I first begin with a pie chart --

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330
and I promise this is the only pie chart

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
in the whole presentation --

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
All the theories in physics that we have today

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
properly explain what is called normal matter --

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
the stuff that we're all made of --

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
and that's four percent of the universe.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
that there is something called dark matter in the universe,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
which makes up 23 percent of the universe,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and something called dark energy,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
which permeates the fabric of space-time,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
that makes up another 73 percent.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
at this point in our exploration of it,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
is unknown or not well understood.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
are in some way addressing this question,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
I will take you first to an underground mine

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
in Northern Minnesota

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
where people are looking

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
for something called dark matter.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
And the reason why they have to go underground

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
the same experiment would be swamped by signals

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
that could be created by things like cosmic rays,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
ambient radio activity,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
even our own bodies. You might not believe it,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
So they go deep inside mines

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
to find a kind of environmental silence

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
that will allow them to hear

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
And I went to see one of these experiments,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
and this is actually -- you can barely see it,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
who left this mine in 1960.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
And physicists came and started using it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
sometime in the 1980s.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
And the miners in the early part of the last century

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
worked, literally, in candlelight.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
And today, you would see this inside the mine,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
half a mile underground.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
There is another way to search for dark matter,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
which is indirectly.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
If dark matter exists in our universe,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
in our galaxy,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
then these particles should be smashing together

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
and producing other particles that we know about --

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
one of them being neutrinos.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
And neutrinos you can detect

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
by the signature they leave

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
when they hit water molecules.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
When a neutrino hits a water molecule

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
it emits a kind of blue light,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
a flash of blue light,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
and by looking for this blue light,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
you can essentially understand something about the neutrino

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
that might have created this neutrino.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
But you need very, very large volumes of water

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
in order to do this.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
You need something like tens of megatons of water --

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
almost a gigaton of water --

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And where in the world would you find such water?

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
This is Lake Baikal.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
It's about 40 to 50 km wide

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
in most places,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
and one to two kilometers deep.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
And what the Russians are doing

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
is they're building these detectors

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
This is Lake Baikal

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
The lake is entirely frozen.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
And the line of black dots

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
that you see in the background,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
The reason why they have to work in winter

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
which, if they did that,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
So they wait until winter --

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
the lake is completely frozen over --

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
and they use this meter-thick ice

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
So this is the Russians working on the ice

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
They have to drill holes in the ice,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
dive down into the water -- cold, cold water --

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
to get hold of the instrument, bring it up,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
put it back and get out before the ice melts.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
and it's full of cracks.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.330
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
underneath, moving.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
I still don't understand this one Russian man

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
working in his bare chest,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
but that tells you how hard he was working.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
And these people, a handful of people,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
have been working for 20 years,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
looking for particles that may or may not exist.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
And they have dedicated their lives to it.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
And just to give you an idea,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
they have spent 20 million over 20 years.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
It's very harsh conditions.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
They work on a shoestring budget.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
covered with a wooden shack.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
And it's that basic,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
but they do this every year.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.330
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
to see something called The Very Large Telescope.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
The Very Large Telescope

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
is one of these things that astronomers do --

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
I can tell you for a fact,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
(Laughter)

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And you wouldn't believe it,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
But nonetheless,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
And these telescopes, among other things,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
they're being used to study

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
And the more you understand that,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
the better you would understand

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.330
what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
as regards this telescope

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
is the mirror.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
Each mirror, there are four of them,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
is made of a single piece of glass,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
that the only way to understand what that is

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
is [to] imagine a city like Paris,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.330
you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
An extraordinary set of telescopes.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
Here's another view of the same.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
The reason why you have to build these telescopes

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
in places like the Atacama Desert

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
is because of the high altitude desert.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
The dry air is really good for telescopes,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
so that the telescopes have

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
about 300 days of clear skies.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.330
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
This is cosmology's final frontier.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
Some of the most amazing experiments,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
some of the most extreme experiments,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
are being done in Antarctica.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
which basically takes telescopes and instruments

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
all the way to the upper atmosphere,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
And that's where they do their experiments,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
That's an American C-17 cargo plane

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
that flew us from New Zealand

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
to McMurdo in Antarctica.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
And here we are about to board our bus.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
And I don't know if you can read the lettering,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
but it says, "Ivan the Terribus."

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.330
And that's taking us to McMurdo.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
And you barely might be able to make out

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
this hut here.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.330
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
when they first came to Antarctica

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
Because it's so cold,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
It's an extraordinary place.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.330
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
and about 200 in winter

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
when it's completely dark for six months.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
I was here to see the launch

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
of this particular type of instrument.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
This is a cosmic ray experiment

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
to an altitude of 40 km.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
So you're using a balloon

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
to carry something that is two tons

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.330
all the way to an altitude of 40 km.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.330
have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
except for the weather.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
The weather, as you can imagine,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.330
this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
And there's a volcano behind,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
which has glaciers at the very top.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
And what they have to do

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
is they have to assemble the entire balloon --

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
and then fill it up with helium.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
And that process takes about two hours.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.330
which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
Those two trucks you see at the very end

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.330
carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
and take it out back to McMurdo Station.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
And this particular balloon,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
because it has to launch two tons of weight,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
is an extremely huge balloon.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
The fabric alone weighs two tons.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
In order to minimize the weight,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.330
it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
And if they have to pack it back,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
they have to put it into boxes

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
except, when they did it first,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
it would have been done in Texas.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.330
so they have to take their shoes off,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
and do that kind of work.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
That's the kind of dedication these people have.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Here's a scene

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
where there's a piece of electronics and explosives

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
being connected to a parachute,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
And remember, all this wiring is being done

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
And I would like to share with you a launch.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.330
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.330
release the balloon, release the balloon.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.330
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
And the thing I want you to look at here

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
is the telescope on the right-hand side.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
And on the far left there

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And I was struck by the juxtaposition

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
and the other one is exploring our interior being.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
And both require silence of some sort.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
And what struck me was

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
every place that I went to to see these telescopes,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
the astronomers and cosmologists

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
are in search of a certain kind of silence,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
whether it's silence from radio pollution

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
or light pollution or whatever.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.330
And it was very obvious

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
Thank you.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
(Applause)
