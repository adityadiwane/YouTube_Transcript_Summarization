00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Climate change is already a heavy topic,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and it's getting heavier

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
because we're understanding

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that we need to do more than we are.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
We're understanding, in fact,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that those of us who live in the developed world

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
when we look at what is there in reality today

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and the magnitude of the problem that we face.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
we tend to seek simple answers.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
We look at where the emissions are coming from --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and we say, okay, well the problem is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
so therefore, the answer must be

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And while, of course, we do need clean energy,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
I would put to you that it's possible

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that by looking at climate change

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
as a clean energy generation problem,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
we're in fact setting ourselves up

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
not to solve it.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And the reason why

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
is that we live on a planet

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that is rapidly urbanizing.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
That shouldn't be news to any of us.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
However, it's hard sometimes

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
to remember the extent of that urbanization.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
By mid-century,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
living in cities or within a day's travel of one.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
In order to provide

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
the kind of energy that it would take

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
for eight billion people living in cities

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
that are even somewhat like the cities

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that those of us in the global North live in today,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
we would have to generate

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
It may be possible

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that we are not even able

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
to build that much clean energy.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
on an urbanizing planet,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
we need to look somewhere else for the solution.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because all of those cities we're building

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are opportunities.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Every city determines to a very large extent

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
I choose to turn this light switch on --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
but really, enormous amounts of our energy use

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
are predestined

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
I won't show you very many graphs today,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
which is, quite simply,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that if you look, for example, at transportation,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
a major category of climate emissions,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
there is a direct relationship

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
between how dense a city is

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
and the amount of climate emissions

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that its residents spew out into the air.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And the correlation, of course,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Basically,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
we substitute, in our lives,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
access to the things we want.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
We go out there and we hop in our cars

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and we drive from place to place.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
But when we live in a denser community,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
suddenly what we find, of course,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
is that the things we need are close by.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And since the most sustainable trip

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
is the one that you never had to make in the first place,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And it is possible, of course,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
to increase the density of the communities around us.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Some places are doing this with new eco districts,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
which is nice work if you can get it,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So we're talking about things like infill development:

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
really sharp little changes

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
to where we have buildings, where we're developing.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Urban retrofitting:

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
creating different sorts of spaces and uses

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
out of places that are already there.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Increasingly, we're realizing

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that we don't even need to densify an entire city.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
What we need instead is an average density

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
that rises to a level

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
where we don't drive as much and so on.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And that can be done

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So you can think of it as tent poles

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
that actually raise the density of the entire city.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And we find that when we do that,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
within a wider fabric of places

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
that are perhaps a little more comfortable

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and achieve the same results.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and still hold onto their cars,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
but the reality is that, by and large,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
is a threshold effect,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
where people simply stop driving as much,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and increasingly, more and more people,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
give up their cars altogether.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And this is a huge, huge energy savings,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because what comes out of our tailpipe

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
is really just the beginning of the story

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
with climate emissions from cars.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
all of the parking and freeways and so on.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
When you can get rid of all of those

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
because somebody doesn't use any of them really,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
as much as 90 percent.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
And people are embracing this.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
to the dream neighborhood.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And when you layer that over

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
what you find is, in fact,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
even more access suffused into spaces.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Some of it's transportation access.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
using public transportation.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
This is Google Walking Maps.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
and it told me to go via Guernsey.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It did tell me that this route

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
(Laughter)

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
But the technologies are getting better,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And as we just heard earlier,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
we're learning how to include

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
in these systems of notation and navigation.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Part of what we're finding with this

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
is that what we thought

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
was the major point

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
of manufacturing and consumption,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
which is to get a bunch of stuff,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
is not, in fact,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
how we really live best in dense environments.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
What we're finding is that what we want

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
is access to the capacities of things.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Okay. I do too.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
in its entire lifetime,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
depending on who you ask.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And so what we do is we buy these drills

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Our cities, I would put to you,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
And while we could try and figure out

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
new ways to use those capacities --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
such as cooking or making ice sculptures

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
or even a mafia hit --

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
what we probably will find

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
is that, in fact, turning those products into services

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
that we have access to when we want them,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
is a far smarter way to go.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
We're finding that people can share the same spaces,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
do stuff with vacant space.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Buildings are becoming bundles of services.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So we have new designs

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
like heating, cooling etc. --

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
So we light our buildings with daylight.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
In fact, when we use all these things,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
what we've found is that, in some cases,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Which brings on another threshold effect

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
I like to call furnace dumping,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
which is, quite simply,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
you save a whole bunch of money up front.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
These things actually become cheaper to build

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
than the alternatives.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Now when we look at being able

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
to slash our product use, slash our transportation use,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
slash our building energy use,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
we need to think a little differently.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
This is one way to do it.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So we have visions like this.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Now all of these are fine projects,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
but they really have missed an essential point,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
which is it's not about the leaves above,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
it's about the systems below.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
so that we can reduce water use?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Water is energy intensive.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
so that we can take runoff

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and water that's going out of our houses

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
and clean it and filter it

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and grow urban street trees?

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
by, for example, connecting us to rivers

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and allowing for restoration?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Do they allow for pollination,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
pollinator pathways

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Do they even take the very waste matter

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
that we have from food and fiber and so forth,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and turn it back into soil

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and sequester carbon --

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
take carbon out of the air

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
in the process of using our cities?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
they're being done right now,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and that it's a darn good thing.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Because right now, our economy by and large

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
operates as Paul Hawken said,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
"by stealing the future, selling it in the present

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
and calling it GDP."

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And if we have another eight billion

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
or seven billion,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
or six billion, even, people,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
we're going to run out of future really fast.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
But if we think differently,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
I think that, in fact, we can have cities

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
that are not only zero emissions,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
but have unlimited possibilities as well.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Thank you very much.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
