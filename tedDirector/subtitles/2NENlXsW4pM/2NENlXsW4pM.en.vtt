00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I wanted to be a rock star.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
This was in the late '80s.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
They wouldn't have me.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And I was certain that's what my life would be.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
when I was 18,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I was stunned to find

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
that there was not a Pop Star 101,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
or even a degree program for that interest.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And the choir conductor there

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
knew that I sang

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and invited me to come and join the choir.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And I left the room and said, "No way."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
"Listen, you've got to join choir.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
all expenses paid.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And so I figured for Mexico and babes,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I could do just about anything.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
And I went to my first day in choir,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and I sat down with the basses

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and sort of looked over my shoulder

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
to see what they were doing.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
and boom, they launched into the Kyrie

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
from the "Requiem" by Mozart.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
In my entire life I had seen in black and white,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
The most transformative experience I've ever had --

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and people singing, people together,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
the shared vision.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And I felt for the first time in my life

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that I was part of something bigger than myself.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I decided to write a piece for choir

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
a couple of years later

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
as a gift to this conductor

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
who had changed my life.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And that piece was published,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And then I started conducting,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And I find myself now in the unlikely position

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
of standing in front of all of you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.260
as a professional classical composer and conductor.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Well a couple of years ago,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
a friend of mine emailed me

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
a link, a YouTube link,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
and said, "You have got to see this."

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
singing the soprano line

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
to a piece of mine called "Sleep."

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
My name is Britlin Losee,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and this is a video

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
that I'd like to make for you.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Here's me singing "Sleep."

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.260
♫ If there are noises ♫

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.260
♫ in the night ♫

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and her voice was so pure.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And I even loved seeing behind her;

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Such an intimate video.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
to all do this same thing,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I actually wrote, "OMG,"

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
hopefully for the last time in public ever.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
(Laughter)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And I sent out this call to singers.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And I made free the download of the music

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to a piece that I had written in the year 2000

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Now I should say, before that,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
what I did is I posted a conductor track

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
of myself conducting.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And it's in complete silence when I filmed it,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
because I was only hearing the music in my head,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
imagining the choir that would one day come to be.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
so that the singers would have something to listen to.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And then as the videos started to come in ...

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
(Singing)

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.260
(Singing)

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
This is Evangelina Etienne

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.260
(Singing)

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
from Massachusetts.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
(Singing)

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Stephen Hanson from Sweden.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
(Singing)

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Singing)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
There was even a little soprano solo in the piece,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and so I had auditions.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
I was told later,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and also by lots of singers who were involved in this,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Here's our winner of the soprano solo.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:58.260
(Singing)

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
like, "No problem, everything's fine."

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
(Laughter)

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And from the crowd

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
emerged this young man, Scott Haines.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And he said, "Listen, this is the project

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
I've been looking for my whole life.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And Scott aggregated all of the videos.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
He scrubbed the audio.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
He made sure that everything lined up.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:39.260
(Singing)

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
I'll stop it there in the interest of time.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.260
(Applause)

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:08.260
(Applause)

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Thank you.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
So there's more. There's more.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Thank you so much.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And I had the same reaction you did.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it --

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
these souls all on their own desert island,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And the video went viral.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
We had a million hits in the first month

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
and got a lot of attention for it.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
"Sleep," which is another work

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
that I wrote in the year 2000 --

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And again, I posted a conductor video,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and we started accepting submissions.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
This time we got some more mature members.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:08.260
(Singing)

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And some younger members.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.260
(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.260
♫ Safe in bed ♫

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Someone did all eight videos --

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
a bass even singing the soprano parts.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
This is Beau Awtin.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.260
(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal --

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop"

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And there were 900 people involved in that.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So I told the singers, "That's our goal.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
That's the number for us to beat."

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And we just closed submissions January 10th,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and our final tally was 2,051 videos

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
from 58 different countries.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Thank you.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
(Applause)

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Jordan, Egypt, Israel,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And we also put a page on Facebook

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
for the singers to upload their testimonials,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
what it was like for them, their experience singing it.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And I've just chosen a few of them here.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
It's so wonderful to sing together again!"

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
"Aside from the beautiful music,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
but who are connected anyway."

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
And my personal favorite,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
he told me that I did not have the voice for it."

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Me too.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
as I've never been part of one.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
satellite is my connection to the world."

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
So two things struck me deeply about this.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
The first is that human beings

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
will go to any lengths necessary

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
to find and connect with each other.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
It doesn't matter the technology.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
And the second is

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It wasn't a virtual choir.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
But, I know myself too, I feel

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
I feel a closeness to this choir --

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
almost like a family.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
What I'd like to close with then today

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
is the first look

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
This will be a premiere today.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
We're not finished with the video yet.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
the render time is just atrocious.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But we do have the first three minutes.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
And it's a tremendous honor

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
for me to be able to show it to you here first.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
You're the very first people to see this.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.260
(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:30.260
♫ beneath the moon ♫

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:42.260
♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:52.260
♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫

00:12:52.260 --> 00:13:07.260
♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.260
♫ Upon my pillow, ♫

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:20.260
♫ safe in bed, ♫

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:32.260
♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
♫ I cannot sleep ♫

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.260
♫ my mind's aflight ♫

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:54.260
♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫

00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:07.260
♫ If there are noises in the night ♫

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:20.260
(Applause)

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.260
(Applause)
