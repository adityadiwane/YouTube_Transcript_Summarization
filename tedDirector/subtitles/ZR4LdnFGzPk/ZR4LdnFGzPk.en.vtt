00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to make an argument today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that may seem a little bit crazy:

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
social media and the end of gender.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Let me connect the dots.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I'm going to argue today

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that the social media applications

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that we all know and love, or love to hate,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
are actually going to help free us

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
from some of the absurd assumptions

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
that we have as a society about gender.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I think that social media

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
is actually going to help us dismantle

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
that we see in media and advertising

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
about gender.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
If you hadn't noticed,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
our media climate generally provides

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
a very distorted mirror

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
of our lives and of our gender,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and I think that's going to change.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Now most media companies --

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
they use very rigid segmentation methods

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
in order to understand their audiences.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
It's old-school demographics.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.260
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Now the crazy thing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
is that media companies believe

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that if you fall within a certain demographic category

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
then you are predictable in certain ways --

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
you have certain taste,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that you like certain things.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And so the bizarre result of this

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
is that most of our popular culture

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
is actually based on these presumptions

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
about our demographics.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Age demographics:

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
the 18 to 49 demo

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
has had a huge impact

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
on all mass media programming in this country

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
since the 1960s,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
when the baby boomers were still young.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now they've aged out of that demographic,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
but it's still the case

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that powerful ratings companies like Nielson

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
don't even take into account

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
viewers of television shows over age 54.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
In our media environment,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
it's as if they don't even exist.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
it's a popular TV show in the States --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
which first came about in the 1960s,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
where you create these complex psychological profiles

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
of consumers.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
It's really just been basic demographics.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
on demographics

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
and how they affect media and entertainment

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
in this country and abroad.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And in the last three years,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and we've discovered some very interesting things.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
All the people who participate in social media networks

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
belong to the same old demographic categories

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that media companies and advertisers

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
have used in order to understand them.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
But those categories mean even less now

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
than they did before,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
because with online networking tools,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
it's much easier for us

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
to escape some of our demographic boxes.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
We're able to connect with people quite freely

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and to redefine ourselves online.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We can also connect with people

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
based on our very specific interests.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
We don't need a media company

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
to help do this for us.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
So the traditional media companies, of course,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
are paying very close attention to these online communities.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
They know this is the mass audience of the future;

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
they need to figure it out.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
But they're having a hard time doing it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
because that's how ad rates are still determined.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
When they're monitoring your clickstream --

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and you know they are --

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
they have a really hard time

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
figuring out your age, your gender and your income.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
They can make some educated guesses.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
But they get a lot more information

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
about what you do online,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
what you like, what interests you.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
That's easier for them to find out than who you are.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And even though that's still sort of creepy,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
there is an upside

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to having your taste monitored.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Suddenly our taste is being respected

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
in a way that it hasn't been before.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
It had been presumed before.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So when you look online at the way people aggregate,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
they don't aggregate

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
around age, gender and income.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
They aggregate around the things they love,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
the things that they like,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and if you think about it, shared interests and values

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
than demographic categories.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
I'd much rather know

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
rather than how old you are.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
That would tell me something more substantial about you.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that's actually quite surprising.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It turns out that women

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
are really driving the social media revolution.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
If you look at the statistics --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
these are worldwide statistics --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
in every single age category,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
women actually outnumber men

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
in their use of social networking technologies.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And then if you look at the amount of time

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
that they spend on these sites,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
they truly dominate the social media space,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
which is a space that's having a huge impact

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
on old media.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
The question is: what sort of impact

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
is this going to have on our culture,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and what's it going to mean for women?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
If the case is that social media

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
is dominating old media

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and women are dominating social media,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
then does that mean that women

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
are going to take over global media?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Are we suddenly going to see

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
a lot more female characters in cartoons

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and in games and on TV shows?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
actually be chick flicks?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Could this be possible,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that suddenly our media landscape

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
will become a feminist landscape?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
because they realize this is important for their business,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and I think that women

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
are also going to continue to dominate

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
the social media sphere.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
responsible for driving a stake through the heart

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.260
of cheesy genre categories

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
like the "chick flick"

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and all these other genre categories

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that presume that certain demographic groups

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
like certain things --

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
that Hispanics like certain things,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
that young people like certain things.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
This is far too simplistic.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
The future entertainment media that we're going to see

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
is going to be very data-driven,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and it's going to be based on the information

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
that we ascertain from taste communities online,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
where women are really driving the action.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
So you may be asking, well why is it important

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
that I know what entertains people?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Why should I know this?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Of course, old media companies and advertisers

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
need to know this.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
But my argument is that,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
if you want to understand the global village,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
it's probably a good idea that you figure out

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
what they're passionate about, what amuses them,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
what they choose to do in their free time.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This is a very important thing to know about people.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I've spent most of my professional life

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
researching media and entertainment

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and its impact on people's lives.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And I do it not just because it's fun --

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
though actually, it is really fun --

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
but also because

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
our research has shown over and over again

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that entertainment and play

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
have a huge impact on people's lives --

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
for instance, on their political beliefs

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and on their health.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
looking at how people amuse themselves

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is a really good way to start.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So imagine a media atmosphere

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
about gender

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and other demographic characteristics.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Can you even imagine what that looks like?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
I can't wait to find out what it looks like.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Thank you so much.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:21.260
(Applause)
