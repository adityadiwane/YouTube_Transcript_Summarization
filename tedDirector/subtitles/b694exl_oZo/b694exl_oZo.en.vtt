00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:31.920
I would like to tell you about a project
which I started about 16 years ago.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.412
It's about making new forms of life.

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:40.976
And these are made of this kind of tube --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.976
electricity tube, we call it in Holland.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.976
And we can start a film about that,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.620
and we can see a little bit
backwards in time.

00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.976
(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts
are going to live in herds on the beaches.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.071
Theo Jansen is working hard
on this evolution.

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:08.976
Theo Jansen: I want to put
these forms of life on the beaches.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
And they should survive over there,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.637
on their own, in the future.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.904
Learning to live on their own --

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:24.555
and it'll take couple of more years

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.339
to let them walk on their own.

00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:33.001
Narrator: The mechanical beasts
will not get their energy from food,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.182
but from the wind.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.381
The wind will move feathers on their back,
which will drive their feet.

00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:42.729
The beast walks sideways
on the wet sand of the beach,

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:45.044
with its nose pointed into the wind.

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:51.712
As soon as it walks into
either the rolling surf or the dry sand,

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:55.062
it stops, and walks
in the opposite direction.

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:00.824
Evolution has generated many species.

00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:07.295
(Music)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.205
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:24.002
(Music)

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:26.976
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.738
(Applause)

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.976
TJ: This is a herd, and it is built
according to genetic codes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.976
And it is a sort of race,
and each and every animal is different,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.171
and the winning codes will multiply.

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:51.949
This is the wave,
going from left to right.

00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:53.123
You can see this one.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:00.360
Yes, and now it goes from left to right.

00:03:00.884 --> 00:03:03.666
This is a new generation, a new family,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.078
which is able to store the wind.

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:10.315
So, the wings pump up air
in lemonade bottles,

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.609
which are on top of that.

00:03:12.213 --> 00:03:17.977
And they can use that energy
in case the wind falls away,

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.492
and the tide is coming up,

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:25.301
and there is still a little bit of energy
to reach the dunes and save their lives,

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:27.325
because they are drowned very easily.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.472
(Laughter)

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:34.328
I could show you this animal.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.311
(Applause)

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:46.538
Thank you.

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:50.976
(Applause)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.442
So, the proportion of the tubes in this
animal is very important for the walking.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.078
There are 11 numbers,
which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.

00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:05.976
These are the distances of the tubes
which make it walk that way.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.976
In fact, it's a new
invention of the wheel.

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:10.976
It works the same as a wheel.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.467
The axis of a wheel
stays on the same level,

00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.583
and this hip is staying
on the same level as well.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.503
In fact, this is better than a wheel,

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:24.976
because when you try to drive
your bicycle on the beach,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.361
you will notice it's very hard to do.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:33.665
And the feet just step over the sand,

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.268
and the wheel has to touch every piece
of the ground in-between.

00:04:38.228 --> 00:04:42.149
So 5,000 years after
the invention of the wheel,

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:43.450
we have a new wheel.

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.976
I will show you, in the next video --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.474
can you start it, please? --

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:53.491
that very heavy loads can be moved.

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:58.976
There's a guy pushing there, behind,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
but it can also walk
on the wind very well.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.623
It's 3.2 tons.

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:13.793
This is working on the stored
wind in the bottles.

00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:17.785
It has a feeler, where it can
feel obstacles and turn around.

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.572
You see, it's going the other way.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.589
Can I have the feeler here?

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.454
OK. Good.

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:48.283
So, they have to survive
all the dangers of the beach,

00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:50.199
and one of the big dangers is the sea.

00:05:50.223 --> 00:05:51.493
This is the sea.

00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:55.160
And it must feel the water of the sea.

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.976
And this is the water feeler,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.980
and what's very important is this tube.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.976
It sucks in air normally,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.082
but when it swallows water,
it feels the resistance of it.

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.436
So, imagine that the animal
is walking towards the sea.

00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:19.999
As soon as it touches the water --

00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:26.611
you should hear a sound of running air.

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.291
(Sound of running air)

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:33.482
Yes!

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:40.884
So if it doesn't feel,
it will be drowned, OK?

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.146
Here we have the brain of the animal.

00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:55.023
In fact, it is a step counter,
and it counts the steps.

00:06:55.468 --> 00:06:56.976
It's a binary step counter.

00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:00.630
So as soon it has been to the sea,

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:05.807
it changes the pattern
of zeroes and ones here.

00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.894
And it always knows
where it is on the beach.

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.257
So it's very simple brain.

00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:17.456
It says, well, there's the sea,
there are dunes, and I'm here.

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:23.229
So it's a sort of imagination
of the simple world of the beach animal.

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:24.959
Thank you.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:32.547
One of the biggest enemies are the storms.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.047
This is a part of the nose
of the Animaris Percipiere.

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:45.467
When the nose of the animal
is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.

00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:52.046
So when the storm is coming up,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.459
it drives a pin into the ground.

00:07:56.483 --> 00:07:58.999
(Laughter)

00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:00.188
Audience member: Wow!

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.334
The nose is fixed,
the whole animal is fixed.

00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:06.345
The wind may turn, but the animal
will always turn its nose into the wind.

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:14.809
Now, another couple of years, and these
animals will survive on their own.

00:08:15.277 --> 00:08:16.833
I still have to help them a lot.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.507
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.024
(Applause)
