00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:20.319
It is very fashionable and proper 
to speak about food

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:27.529
in all its forms, all its colors, 
aromas and tastes.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.183
But after the food goes through 
the digestive system,

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:36.429
when it is thrown out as crap,

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.026
it is no longer fashionable
to speak about it.

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:44.685
It is rather revolting.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:52.362
I'm a guy who has graduated 
from bullshit to full-shit.

00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:55.801
(Laughter)

00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:02.466
My organization, Gram Vikas, which means
"village development organization,"

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.572
was working in the area 
of renewable energy.

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:09.322
On the most part, we were 
producing biogas,

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:13.140
biogas for rural kitchens.

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:20.050
We produce biogas in India 
by using animal manure,

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.551
which usually, in India, 
is called cow dung.

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.605
But as the gender-sensitive 
person that I am,

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.533
I would like to call it bullshit.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.916
But realizing later on

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:39.493
how important were sanitation
and the disposal of crap in a proper way,

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:44.051
we went into the arena of sanitation.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:53.870
Eighty percent of all diseases 
in India and most developing countries

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.917
are because of poor quality water.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.511
And when we look at the reason 
for poor quality water,

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:07.309
you find that it is our abysmal attitude 
to the disposal of human waste.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:12.344
Human waste, in its rawest form,

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:18.400
finds its way back to drinking water,
bathing water, washing water,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.828
irrigation water, whatever water you see.

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:27.874
And this is the cause for 80 percent 
of the diseases in rural areas.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:35.695
In India, it is unfortunately only the
women who carry water.

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:39.303
So for all domestic needs,
women have to carry water.

00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:45.098
So that is a pitiable state of affairs.

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:48.761
Open defecation is rampant.

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:52.866
Seventy percent of India
defecates in the open.

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.150
They sit there out in the open,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.178
with the wind on their sails,

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:02.021
hiding their faces, exposing their bases,

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:06.889
and sitting there in pristine glory --

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.195
70 percent of India.

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:12.428
And if you look at the world total,

00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:18.963
60 percent of all the crap that is thrown
into the open is by Indians.

00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:23.929
A fantastic distinction.

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:28.081
I don't know if we Indians can be proud
of such a distinction.

00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:29.991
(Laughter)

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:32.278
So we, together with a lot of villages,

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:37.022
we began to talk about how to really 
address this situation of sanitation.

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:42.979
And we came together and formed 
a project called MANTRA.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:49.836
MANTRA stands for Movement and Action
Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:56.412
So we are speaking about transformation,
transformation in rural areas.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.224
Villages that agree 
to implement this project,

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:04.087
they organize a legal society

00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:08.453
where the general body 
consists of all members

00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:14.336
who elect a group of men and women
who implement the project

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:19.101
and, later on, who look after
the operation and maintenance.

00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:24.862
They decide to build a toilet 
and a shower room.

00:04:24.862 --> 00:04:27.943
And from a protected water source,

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:34.862
water will be brought to an elevated water
reservoir and piped to all households

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:37.327
through three taps:

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:43.629
one in the toilet, one in the shower, 
one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.940
The pity is that our cities,
like New Delhi and Bombay,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.371
do not have a 24-hour water supply.

00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:56.174
But in these villages, we want to have it.

00:04:57.084 --> 00:05:00.568
There is a distinct difference 
in the quality.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:07.328
Well in India, we have a theory,
which is very much accepted

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.910
by the government bureaucracy
and all those who matter,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.823
that poor people deserve poor solutions

00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:22.058
and absolutely poor people deserve
pathetic solutions.

00:05:22.058 --> 00:05:28.503
This, combined with 
a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that

00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:30.872
the cheapest is the most economic,

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:35.560
is the heady cocktail that the poor
are forced to drink.

00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:40.450
We are fighting against this.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.941
We feel that the poor have been
humiliated for centuries.

00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:49.359
And even in sanitation,

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:51.545
they should not be humiliated.

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:54.239
Sanitation is more about dignity

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.907
than about human disposal of waste.

00:05:56.907 --> 00:06:01.236
And so you build these toilets 
and very often,

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:07.442
we have to hear that the toilets are
better than their houses.

00:06:07.442 --> 00:06:11.323
And you can see that in front are 
the attached houses

00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:14.151
and the others are the toilets.

00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:20.799
So these people, without a single
exception of a family in a village,

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:23.455
decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.

00:06:24.598 --> 00:06:30.256
And for that, they come together,
collect all the local materials --

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:35.611
local materials like rubble, 
sand, aggregates,

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:38.139
usually a government subsidy is available

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.417
to meet at least part of the cost 
of external materials

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.926
like cement, steel, toilet commode.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:48.598
And they build a toilet 
and a bathing room.

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:56.695
Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is 
daily wage earners, mostly landless,

00:06:56.695 --> 00:07:03.499
are given an opportunity to be 
trained as masons and plumbers.

00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:09.175
So while these people are being trained, 
others are collecting the materials.

00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:14.841
And when both are ready,
they build a toilet, a shower room,

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:21.840
and of course also a water tower, 
an elevated water reservoir.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.171
We use a system of two leach pits 
to treat the waste.

00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:31.469
From the toilet, the muck comes
into the first leach pit.

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:36.494
And when it is full, it is blocked 
and it can go to the next.

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:41.343
But we discovered that if you plant
banana trees, papaya trees

00:07:41.343 --> 00:07:44.726
on the periphery of these leach pits,

00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:47.987
they grow very well
because they suck up all the nutrients

00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:53.478
and you get very tasty bananas, papayas.

00:07:53.478 --> 00:07:56.180
If any of you come to my place,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.293
I would be happy to share
these bananas and papayas with you.

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:07.288
So there you can see 
the completed toilets, the water towers.

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:11.378
This is in a village where 
most of the people are even illiterate.

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:15.508
It is always a 24-hour water supply

00:08:15.508 --> 00:08:21.114
because water gets polluted
very often when you store it --

00:08:21.114 --> 00:08:26.936
a child dips his or her hand into it,
something falls into it.

00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:31.225
So no water is stored. It's always on tap.

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:37.416
This is how an elevated 
water reservoir is constructed.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.596
And that is the end product.

00:08:39.596 --> 00:08:44.283
Because it has to go high,
and there is some space available,

00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:47.159
two or three rooms are made
under the water tower,

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:51.801
which are used by the village for 
different committee meetings.

00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:57.802
We have had clear evidence
of the great impact of this program.

00:08:58.675 --> 00:09:02.428
Before we started, there were, as usual,

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:07.713
more than 80 percent of people suffering
from waterborne diseases.

00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:14.231
But after this, we have empirical evidence
that 82 percent, on average,

00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:18.686
among all these villages --
1,200 villages have completed it --

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:23.823
waterborne diseases 
have come down 82 percent.

00:09:23.823 --> 00:09:30.073
(Applause)

00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:35.411
Women usually used to spend, 
especially in the summer months,

00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:42.295
about six to seven hours 
a day carrying water.

00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:46.890
And when they went to carry water,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:52.259
because, as I said earlier,
it's only women who carry water,

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:58.834
they used to take their little children,
girl children, also to carry water,

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:03.615
or else to be back at home
to look after the siblings.

00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:07.856
So there were less than nine percent
of girl children attending school,

00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:10.207
even if there was a school.

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:13.179
And boys, about 30 percent.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:20.148
But girls, it has gone to about 90 percent
and boys, almost to 100 percent.

00:10:20.148 --> 00:10:24.795
(Applause)

00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:28.027
The most vulnerable section in a village

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:32.086
are the landless laborers who are
the daily wage-earners.

00:10:32.086 --> 00:10:34.696
Because they have gone 
through this training

00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:38.296
to be masons and plumbers and bar benders,

00:10:38.296 --> 00:10:44.559
now their ability to earn has 
increased 300 to 400 percent.

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:49.765
So this is a democracy in action

00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:53.591
because there is a general body, 
a governing board, the committee.

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.461
People are questioning, 
people are governing themselves,

00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:59.110
people are learning to manage
their own affairs,

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.167
they are taking their own futures
into their hands.

00:11:02.882 --> 00:11:08.731
And that is democracy at
the grassroots level in action.

00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:16.005
More than 1,200 villages 
have so far done this.

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:22.614
It benefits over 400,000 people
and it's still going on.

00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:27.625
And I hope it continues to move ahead.

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:34.052
For India and such developing countries,

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:39.684
armies and armaments,

00:11:39.684 --> 00:11:45.232
software companies and spaceships

00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:54.944
may not be as important
as taps and toilets.

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:57.366
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:01.897
(Applause)

00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:05.803
Thank you.
