00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:17.346
(Music)

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:37.731
(Music)

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:14.649
(Music ends)

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.633
(Applause)

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:26.599
So, that's what I've done with my life.

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:28.081
(Laughter)

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.713
(Applause)

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:31.890
Thank you.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:36.112
(Applause)

00:01:37.312 --> 00:01:39.809
As a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.764
and I did what most little kids do.

00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:45.500
I played a little baseball,
did a few other things like that,

00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:47.810
but I always had the sense
of being an outsider,

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.675
and it wasn't until I saw
pictures in the magazines

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:52.952
that a couple other guys skate, I thought,

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:54.496
"Wow, that's for me," you know?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.120
Because there was no coach
standing directly over you,

00:01:57.144 --> 00:01:59.400
and these guys,
they were just being themselves.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:01.646
There was no opponent
directly across from you.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.938
And I loved that sense,
so I started skating

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:08.211
when I was about 10 years old, in 1977,

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.356
and when I did,
I picked it up pretty quickly.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.909
In fact, here's some footage
from about 1984.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:20.052
It wasn't until 79
I won my first amateur championship,

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:24.853
and then, by 81, I was 14,
and I won my first world championship,

00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:28.390
which was amazing to me,

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.479
and in a very real sense,
that was the first real victory I had.

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:32.668
Oh, watch this.

00:02:32.692 --> 00:02:35.227
This is a Casper slide,
where the board's upside down.

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.839
Mental note on that one.

00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:38.323
(Laughter)

00:02:38.347 --> 00:02:39.827
And this one here?

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:41.639
An ollie.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.875
So, as she mentioned,
that is overstated for sure,

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.763
but that's why they called me
the godfather of modern street skating.

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:53.118
Here's some images of that.

00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:01.048
Now, I was about halfway
through my pro career

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:04.415
in, I would say, the mid-'80s.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.171
Freestyle itself -- we developed
all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:11.454
but there was evolving
a new kind of skateboarding,

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:16.298
where guys were taking it to the streets,
and they were using that ollie,

00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:17.706
like I showed you.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.053
They were using it to get up
onto stuff like bleachers and handrails

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:23.881
and over stairwells
and all kinds of cool stuff.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.154
So it was evolving upwards.

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.886
In fact, when someone tells you
they're a skater today,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.881
they pretty much mean a street skater,

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:34.191
because freestyle, it took about
five years for it to die,

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:40.270
and at that stage, I'd been a "champion"
champion for 11 years, which --

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:41.736
Phew!

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.309
And suddenly, it was over for me,
that's it -- it was gone.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.797
They took my pro model off the shelf,

00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:50.633
which was essentially
pronouncing you dead, publicly.

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:52.620
That's how you make your money, you know?

00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:55.940
You have a signature board
and wheels and shoes and clothes.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:57.995
I had all that stuff, and it's gone.

00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.464
The crazy thing was, there was
a really liberating sense about it,

00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:07.074
because I no longer had to protect
my record as a champion.

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:08.278
"Champion," again.

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:10.853
Champion sounds so goofy,
but it's what it was, right?

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:14.479
What drew me to
skateboarding, the freedom,

00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:17.054
was now restored,
where I could just create things,

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.930
because that's where the joy
was for me, always,

00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:22.124
was creating new stuff.

00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:25.679
The other thing that I had
was a deep well of tricks to draw from

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:27.932
that were rooted
in these flat ground tricks.

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:30.954
Stuff the normal guys were doing
was very much different.

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:32.808
So, as humbling and rotten as it was â€”

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.540
And believe me, it was rotten.

00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:38.902
I would go to skate spots,
and I was already "famous guy," right?

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:40.738
And everyone thought I was good,

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:43.056
but in this new terrain, I was horrible.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.897
So people would go,
"Oh, what happened to Mullen?"

00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:49.221
(Laughter)

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:51.885
So, humbling as it was, I began again.

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.356
Here are some tricks that I started
to bring to that new terrain.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.989
And again, there's this undergirding
layer of influence of freestyle --

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:02.779
Oh, that one?

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:05.587
That's, like, the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.087
OK, look at that, it's a Darkslide.

00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:09.951
See how it's sliding on the backside?

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:14.176
Those are super fun,
and, actually, not that hard.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.792
You know, at the very root
of that, see, Caspers,

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.385
see how you throw it?

00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:21.991
Simple as that, right? No biggie.

00:05:22.015 --> 00:05:25.483
And your front foot,
the way it grabs it --

00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:29.528
I'd seen someone slide
on the back of the board like that,

00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:31.474
and I was like, "How can I get it over?"

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.204
Because that had not yet been done.

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:36.111
And then it dawned on me,
and here's part of what I'm saying.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.328
I had an infrastructure.
I had this deep layer,

00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:40.780
where it was like, oh my gosh,
it's just your foot.

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:42.876
It's just the way
you throw your board over.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.160
Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy,

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:47.584
and the next thing you know,
there's 20 more tricks

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:49.096
based out of the variations.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.753
So that's the kind of thing --
here, check this out,

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.838
here's another way,
and I won't overdo this.

00:05:53.862 --> 00:05:55.516
A little indulgent, I understand.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.552
There's something called a Primo slide.

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.168
It is the funnest trick ever to do.

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:06.845
It's like skimboarding.

00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:10.961
And this one, look how it slides
sideways, every which way?

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:13.813
OK, so when you're skating,
and you take a fall,

00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:16.914
the board slips that way or that way;
it's kind of predictable.

00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:19.982
This? It goes every which way --
it's like a cartoon, the falls,

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:22.094
and that's what I love the most about it.

00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:23.744
It's so much fun to do.

00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:27.029
In fact, when I started doing them,
I remember, because I got hurt.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.840
I had to get a knee surgery, right?

00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:33.107
So there were a couple of weeks
where I couldn't skate at all.

00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:36.017
It would give out on me,
and I would watch the guys,

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:38.950
I'd go to this warehouse
where a lot of the guys were skating,

00:06:38.974 --> 00:06:40.294
my friends, and I was like,

00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:43.062
"I've got to do something new,
I want to do something new.

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:44.261
I want to start fresh."

00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:47.307
And so the night before my surgery,
I'd watched, and I was like,

00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.679
"How am I going to do this?"

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:50.533
So I ran up, and I jumped on my board,

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.505
and I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.424
and I remember thinking,
I landed so light-footed, thinking,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.624
if my knee gives, they'll just have
more work to do in the morning.

00:06:58.648 --> 00:06:59.819
(Laughter)

00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:01.893
And so, when it was the crazy thing.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:04.633
I don't know how many
of you guys have had surgery, but --

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.096
(Laughter)

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.412
you are so helpless, right?

00:07:07.436 --> 00:07:10.262
You're on this gurney
and you're watching the ceiling go by,

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:11.667
every time, it's always that,

00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.029
and right when they're putting
the mask on you before you go to sleep,

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:18.227
all I was thinking is,
"Man, when I wake up and I get better,

00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:20.736
the first thing I'm going to do
is film that trick."

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:25.558
And indeed I did, it was the very first
thing I filmed, which was awesome.

00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:29.980
I told you a little bit
about the evolution of the tricks.

00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:31.845
Consider that content, in a sense.

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:36.081
What we do as street skaters is,
you have these tricks --

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:38.123
Say I'm working on Darkslides, or a Primo,

00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:40.030
that you guys know this stuff now.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:41.820
(Laughter)

00:07:41.844 --> 00:07:44.178
What you do is, you cruise
around the same streets

00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:45.989
that you've seen a hundred times,

00:07:46.013 --> 00:07:48.782
but suddenly, because
you already have something

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:54.027
in this fixed domain of this target,
it's like, what will match this trick?

00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.067
How can I expand, how can the context,

00:07:57.091 --> 00:08:00.144
how can the environment change
the very nature of what I do?

00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:03.992
So you drive and drive and drive,
and, actually I've got to admit,

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.740
just because I was struggling
with this because I'm here,

00:08:06.764 --> 00:08:09.249
but I'll just say it,
is, I cannot tell you,

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:11.018
not only to be here in front of you,

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:13.568
but what a privilege it is
to be at US campus,

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:17.628
because I have been escorted off
of this campus so many times.

00:08:17.652 --> 00:08:20.429
(Laughter)

00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:22.459
(Applause)

00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:28.313
So let me give you another example
of how context shapes content.

00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:31.642
This is a place not that far from here,
It's a rotten neighborhood.

00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:34.238
Your first consideration is,
am I going to get beat up?

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:36.715
You go out and -- See this wall?

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:42.600
It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning
to do bank tricks, right?

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:45.344
But there's this other aspect
of it for wheelies,

00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:46.658
so check this out.

00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:48.858
There's a few tricks, again,

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:51.283
how environment changes
the nature of your tricks.

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:54.009
Freestyle oriented,
manual down -- wheelie down.

00:08:54.504 --> 00:08:57.578
Watch, this one? Oh, I love this,
it's like surfing, this one,

00:08:57.602 --> 00:08:59.156
the way you catch it.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.330
This one, a little sketchy
going backwards,

00:09:02.354 --> 00:09:03.541
and watch the back foot.

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:06.267
Oops --

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:07.704
(Laughter)

00:09:07.728 --> 00:09:09.228
Mental note right there.

00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:10.850
Again, we'll get back to that.

00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:12.025
(Laughter)

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:13.485
Here, back foot, back foot.

00:09:14.438 --> 00:09:15.611
OK, up there?

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:16.944
That was called a 360 flip.

00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:19.701
Notice how the board flipped
and spun this way, both axes.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:26.029
And another example
of how the context changed,

00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:30.047
and the creative process
for me and for most skaters,

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:33.293
is, you go, you get out of the car,
you check for security,

00:09:33.317 --> 00:09:34.474
you check for stuff.

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:35.693
(Laughter)

00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:38.188
It's funny, you get to know
their rhythms, you know,

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.835
the guys that cruise around --

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.229
(Laughter)

00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:43.348
Skateboarding is such
a humbling thing, man.

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:46.272
No matter how good you are,
you've still got to deal with --

00:09:46.296 --> 00:09:48.327
So you hit this wall, and when I hit it,

00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:50.619
the first thing you do
is you fall forward,

00:09:50.643 --> 00:09:52.333
and I'm like, all right, all right.

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:53.507
As you adjust ...

00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:57.440
you punch it up,
and then when I would do that,

00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:59.446
it was throwing my shoulder this way ...

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:04.925
which as I was doing it, I was like,
"Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip,"

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:07.602
because that's how
you load up for a 360 flip.

00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:11.608
And so this is what I want
to emphasize that, as you can imagine,

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:15.210
all of these tricks are made
of submovements,

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:16.552
executive motor functions,

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:19.614
more granular to the degree
to which I can't quite tell you,

00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:20.994
but one thing I do know is,

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:24.986
every trick is made of combining two
or three or four or five movements.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.275
And so, as I'm going up,
these things are floating around,

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.034
and you have to sort of
let the cognitive mind rest back,

00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:32.324
pull it back a little bit,

00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:34.779
and let your intuition go
as you feel these things.

00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:37.310
And these submovements
are kind of floating around,

00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:40.298
and as the wall hits you,
they connect themselves to an extent,

00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:43.897
and that's when the cognitive mind:
"Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:46.426
So that's how that works
to me, the creative process,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.338
the process itself, of street skating.

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:49.737
So, next -- Oh, mind you ...

00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:50.827
(Laughter)

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:52.015
Those are the community.

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.688
These are some of the best
skaters in the world.

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:57.835
These are my friends --
oh my gosh, they're such good people.

00:10:58.307 --> 00:11:00.815
And the beauty of skateboarding is that,

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:02.803
no one guy is the best.

00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:06.199
In fact, I know this is rotten to say,
they're my friends,

00:11:06.223 --> 00:11:09.699
but a couple of them actually don't look
that comfortable on their board.

00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:14.739
What makes them great is the degree
to which they use their skateboarding

00:11:14.763 --> 00:11:16.022
to individuate themselves.

00:11:16.046 --> 00:11:18.369
Every single one of these guys,
you look at them,

00:11:18.393 --> 00:11:20.807
you can see a silhouette
of them, and you realize,

00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.120
"Oh, that's him,
that's Haslam, that's Koston,

00:11:23.144 --> 00:11:25.695
there's these guys, these are the guys."

00:11:26.323 --> 00:11:30.377
And skaters, I think
they tend to be outsiders

00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:33.742
who seek a sense of belonging,

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:35.816
but belonging on their own terms.

00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:41.347
And real respect is given
by how much we take what other guys do,

00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:46.267
these basic tricks, 360 flips,
we take that, we make it our own,

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.577
and then we contribute
back to the community

00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:51.227
the inner way that edifies
the community itself.

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:54.095
The greater the contribution,

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:57.198
the more we express
and form our individuality,

00:11:58.372 --> 00:12:02.237
which is so important to a lot of us
who feel like rejects to begin with.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:04.501
The summation of that

00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:08.366
gives us something we could never
achieve as an individual.

00:12:09.784 --> 00:12:10.951
I should say this.

00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:12.849
There's some sort of beautiful symmetry

00:12:12.873 --> 00:12:15.680
that the degree to which
we connect to a community

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.325
is in proportion to our individuality,

00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:20.426
which we are expressing by what we do.

00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:22.478
Next,

00:12:22.502 --> 00:12:26.900
these guys, very similar community
that's extremely conducive to innovation.

00:12:26.924 --> 00:12:28.110
(Laughter)

00:12:28.134 --> 00:12:31.287
Notice a couple of these shots
from the police department.

00:12:31.707 --> 00:12:34.481
But it is quite similar,
I mean, what is it to hack, right?

00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:37.789
It's knowing a technology so well
that you can manipulate it

00:12:37.813 --> 00:12:42.172
and steer it to do things
it was never intended to do, right?

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:43.531
And they're not all bad.

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:47.625
You can be a Linux kernel hacker,
make it more stable, right?

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:48.887
More safe, more secure.

00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:50.841
You can be an iOS hacker,

00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:53.789
make your iPhone do stuff
it wasn't supposed to.

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:56.550
Not authorized, but not illegal.

00:12:56.574 --> 00:12:58.919
And then, you've got
some of these guys, right?

00:12:58.943 --> 00:13:01.485
What they do is very similar
to our creative process.

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.205
They connect disparate information,

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:10.096
and they bring it together in a way
that a security analyst doesn't expect.

00:13:10.672 --> 00:13:12.362
It doesn't make them good people,

00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:15.078
but it's at the heart of engineering,

00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:19.632
at the heart of a creative community,
an innovative community,

00:13:19.656 --> 00:13:22.521
and the open source community,
the basic ethos of it

00:13:22.545 --> 00:13:26.053
is, take what other people do,
make it better,

00:13:26.077 --> 00:13:28.241
give it back so we all rise further.

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.654
Very similar communities, very similar.

00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:32.669
We have our edgier sides, too.

00:13:32.693 --> 00:13:33.898
(Laughter)

00:13:33.922 --> 00:13:35.385
It's funny, my dad was right.

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:36.789
These are my peers.

00:13:37.908 --> 00:13:40.492
But I respect what they do,
and they respect what I do,

00:13:40.516 --> 00:13:43.265
because they can do things,
it's amazing what they can do.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.921
In fact, one of them,

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:49.144
he was Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur
of the Year for San Diego County,

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:52.228
so they're not -- you never know
who you're dealing with.

00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:55.734
We've all had some degree of fame.

00:13:55.758 --> 00:14:00.802
In fact, I've had so much success
that I strangely always feel unworthy of.

00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:03.785
I've had a patent, and that was cool,
and we started a company,

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:05.931
and it grew, and it became the biggest,

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:08.840
and then it went down,
and then it became the biggest again,

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:11.535
which is harder than the first time,
and then we sold it,

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.080
and then we sold it again.

00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:15.064
So I've had some success.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.667
And in the end, when you've had
all of these things,

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.555
what is it that continues to drive you?

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:21.864
As I mentioned, the knee stuff
and these things,

00:14:21.888 --> 00:14:23.454
what is it that will punch you?

00:14:23.478 --> 00:14:25.299
Because it's not just the mind.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.168
What is it that will punch you
and make you do something

00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:31.210
and bring it to another level,
and when you've had it all,

00:14:31.234 --> 00:14:34.879
sometimes, guys, they die on the vine
with all of that talent,

00:14:35.492 --> 00:14:38.160
and one of the things
we've had, all of us, is fame --

00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:40.994
I think the best kind of fame,
because you can take it off.

00:14:41.018 --> 00:14:43.064
I've been all around the world,

00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:45.708
and there will be a thousand kids
crying out your name,

00:14:45.732 --> 00:14:47.780
and it's such a weird,
visceral experience.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.411
It's like, it's disorienting.

00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:51.513
And you get in a car, and you drive away,

00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:54.407
and 10-minute drive, and you get out,

00:14:54.431 --> 00:14:56.242
and no one gives a rat's who you are.

00:14:56.266 --> 00:14:57.632
(Laughter)

00:14:57.656 --> 00:15:00.937
And it gives you that clarity
of perspective of, man, I'm just me,

00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:03.671
and popularity, what does that
really mean again?

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.116
Not much.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.299
It's peer respect that drives us.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.644
That's the one thing
that makes us do what we do.

00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:13.749
I've had over a dozen bones,
this guy, over, eight, 10 concussions,

00:15:13.773 --> 00:15:16.293
to the point where it's comedy, right?

00:15:16.317 --> 00:15:19.048
It is actually comedy, they mess with him.

00:15:19.072 --> 00:15:20.500
(Laughter)

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.821
Next,

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:24.417
and this is something deeper.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.762
I think I was on tour when I was reading
one of the Feynman biographies.

00:15:29.786 --> 00:15:31.809
It was the red one or the blue one.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:35.515
And he made this statement
that was so profound to me.

00:15:39.101 --> 00:15:43.190
It was that the Nobel Prize
was the tombstone on all great work,

00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:47.921
and it resonated because
I had won 35 out of 36 contests

00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:51.286
that I'd entered over 11 years,
and it made me bananas.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.556
In fact, winning
isn't the word, I won it once.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.632
The rest of the time,
you're just defending,

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:58.231
and you get into this,
turtle posture, you know?

00:15:58.255 --> 00:16:01.365
Where you're not doing --
it usurped the joy of what I loved to do

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:04.541
because I was no longer doing it
to create and have fun,

00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:06.276
and when it died out from under me,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.356
that was one of the most
liberating things,

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.966
because I could create.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.685
And look, I understand that
I am on the very edge of preachy, here.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:15.873
I'm not here to do that.

00:16:15.897 --> 00:16:18.639
It's just that I'm in front
of a very privileged audience.

00:16:18.663 --> 00:16:21.543
If you guys aren't already
leaders in your community,

00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:24.635
you probably will be,
and if there's anything I can give you

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:27.839
that will transcend what I've gotten
from skateboarding,

00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:30.885
the only things of meaning,
I think, and of permanence,

00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:32.967
it's not fame, it's not all these things.

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:36.902
What it is, is that there's
an intrinsic value in creating something

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:38.719
for the sake of creating it,

00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:42.914
and better than that,
because I'm 46 years old, or I'll be 46,

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:46.564
and how pathetic is that
I'm still skateboarding, but there is --

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:52.411
there is this beauty in dropping it
into a community of your own making,

00:16:52.727 --> 00:16:56.014
and seeing it dispersed,
and seeing younger, more talented,

00:16:56.038 --> 00:16:59.279
just different talent, take it to levels
you can never imagine,

00:16:59.303 --> 00:17:00.967
because that lives on.

00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:02.693
So thank you for your time.

00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:09.717
(Applause)

00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:14.838
Kristina Holly: I have a question for you.

00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:18.610
(Applause)

00:17:18.634 --> 00:17:22.531
So you've really reinvented yourself
in the past, from freestyle to street,

00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:25.840
and, I think it was about four years ago
you officially retired.

00:17:25.864 --> 00:17:28.191
Is that it? What's next?

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.879
Rodney Mullen: That's a good question.
KG: Something tells me it's not the end.

00:17:32.903 --> 00:17:36.687
RM: Yeah. Every time you think
you've chased something down,

00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:39.848
it's funny, no matter how good you are,
and I know guys like this,

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:42.238
it feels like you're polishing
a turd, you know?

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:45.468
(Laughter)

00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:48.028
And I thought, the only way
I can extend this

00:17:48.052 --> 00:17:50.083
is to change something infrastructural.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.118
And so that's what I proceeded to do,
through a long story,

00:17:54.142 --> 00:17:58.403
one of desperation, so if I do it,
rather than talk about it,

00:17:58.427 --> 00:18:00.370
if I do it, you'll be the first to know.

00:18:00.394 --> 00:18:03.396
KG: All right, we won't ask you any more.
RM: You'll get a text.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.395
KG: Right, thank you, good job.
RM: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:11.107
(Applause)
