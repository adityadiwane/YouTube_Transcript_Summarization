00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
My wife sent me a message,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
"Whoa, earthquake,"

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and then disappeared for 25 minutes.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
I was afraid of a tsunami;

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
what I didn't realize

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
was there was a greater terror in Haiti,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
and that was building collapse.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
We've all seen the photos

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
These are shots my wife took

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
a couple days after the quake,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
This is the national palace --

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
the equivalent of the White House.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
at peak shopping time.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
This is a nurses' college --

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
there are 300 nurses studying.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
The general hospital right next door

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
emerged largely unscathed.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
We have all heard

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
about the tremendous human loss

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in the earthquake in Haiti,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
but we haven't heard enough

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
about why all those lives were lost.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
We haven't heard about

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
why the buildings failed.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
After all, it was the buildings,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
not the earthquake,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that killed 220,000 people,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
that injured 330,000,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that displaced 1.3 million people,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
that cut off food

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and water and supplies

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
for an entire nation.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.260
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
in decades,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and it was not a natural disaster --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
it was a disaster of engineering.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
AIDG has worked in Haiti

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
since 2007,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
providing engineering and business support

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
to small businesses.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
to figure out why the buildings collapsed,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to examine what was safe and what wasn't.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Working with MINUSTAH,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
with the Ministry of Public Works,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
with different NGOs,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
we inspected over 1,500 buildings.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
We inspected schools

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and private residencies.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
We inspected medical centers

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and food warehouses.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
We inspected government buildings.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
This is the Ministry of Justice.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Behind that door

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
is the National Judicial Archives.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
who's the director

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.260
of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
at the University of Buffalo --

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
was examining it to see if it was safe

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
to recover the archives.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Andre told me,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
after seeing these buildings fail

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
again and again in the same way,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that there is no new research here.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
There is nothing here that we don't know.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
The failure points were the same:

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that's a roof slab hanging off the building --

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
cantilevered structures,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
or structures that were asymmetric,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
that shook violently and came down,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
poor building materials,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
not enough concrete,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
not enough compression in the blocks,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
rebar that was smooth,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Now there's a solution

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to all these problems.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And we know how to build properly.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
The proof of this came in Chile,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
almost a month later,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
when 8.8 magnitude earthquake

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
hit Chile.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
That is 500 times

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
the power of the 7.0

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that hit Port-au-Prince --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
500 times the power,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
yet only under a thousand casualties.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Adjusted for population density,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that is less than one percent

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
of the impact of the Haitian quake.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
What was the difference

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
between Chile and Haiti?

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Seismic standards

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and confined masonry,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
where the building acts as a whole --

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
walls and columns

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and roofs and slabs

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
tied together to support each other --

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
If you look at this building in Chile,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it's ripped in half,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
but it's not a pile of rubble.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Chileans have been building with confined masonry

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
for decades.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Architecture for Humanity,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
to bring more confined masonry training

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
into Haiti.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
This is Xantus Daniel;

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
he's a mason,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
just a general construction worker, not a foreman,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
who took one of our trainings.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
On his last job he was working with his boss,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and they started pouring the columns wrong.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
He took his boss aside,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
It won't cost us any more

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to do it the right way."

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And they redid that building.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
They tied the rebar right,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
they poured the columns right,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and that building will be safe.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And every building

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
that they build going forward

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
will be safe.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
To make sure these buildings are safe,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
it's not going to take policy --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
it's going to take reaching out

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
to the masons on the ground

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and helping them learn the proper techniques.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Now there are many groups doing this.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And the fellow in the vest there,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Craig Toten,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
he has pushed forward

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Through Haiti Rewired,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
AIDG,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
there is the possibility

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to reach out

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
across the country

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and create a movement of proper building.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
If you reach out to the people on the ground

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
in this collaborative way

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
it's extremely affordable.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
For the billions spent on reconstruction,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
you can train masons

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
for dollars on every house

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that they end up building over their lifetime.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Ultimately, there are two ways

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that you can rebuild Haiti;

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
the way at the top

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
The way at the top

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
is a poorly constructed building

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that will fail.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
where the walls are tied together,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
the building is symmetric,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and it will stand up to an earthquake.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
For all the disaster,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
there is an opportunity here

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
to build better houses

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
for the next generation,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
so that when the next earthquake hits,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
it is a disaster --

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
but not a tragedy.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.260
(Applause)
