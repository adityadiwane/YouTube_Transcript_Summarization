00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.686
Here's a question we need to rethink together:

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:20.127
What should be the role of money

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:23.613
and markets in our societies?

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:26.107
Today, there are very few things

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:28.795
that money can't buy.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.452
If you're sentenced to a jail term

00:00:30.452 --> 00:00:32.903
in Santa Barbara, California,

00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:34.255
you should know

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.970
that if you don't like the standard accommodations,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.313
you can buy a prison cell upgrade.

00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:44.159
It's true. For how much, do you think?

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.100
What would you guess?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.805
Five hundred dollars?

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:51.140
It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.164
Eighty-two dollars a night.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:55.536
Eighty-two dollars a night.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.736
If you go to an amusement park

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:00.428
and don't want to stand in the long lines

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:01.884
for the popular rides,

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:04.771
there is now a solution.

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:09.035
In many theme parks, you can pay extra

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.649
to jump to the head of the line.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.164
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:18.753
And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:21.969
In Washington, D.C., long lines,

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.909
queues sometimes form

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.778
for important Congressional hearings.

00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:31.283
Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,

00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:33.788
maybe overnight, even in the rain.

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:35.785
So now, for lobbyists and others

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:37.591
who are very keen to attend these hearings

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:40.310
but don't like to wait, there are companies,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.353
line-standing companies,

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.216
and you can go to them.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:46.105
You can pay them a certain amount of money,

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.370
they hire homeless people and others who need a job

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.653
to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,

00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:55.521
and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.400
can take his or her place at the head of the line

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.145
and a seat in the front of the room.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:04.224
Paid line standing.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.806
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.480
and market thinking and market solutions,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.112
in bigger arenas.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:15.783
Take the way we fight our wars.

00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:18.850
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.895
there were more private military contractors on the ground

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:26.715
than there were U.S. military troops?

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:29.834
Now this isn't because we had a public debate

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.811
about whether we wanted to outsource war

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.982
to private companies,

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:37.689
but this is what has happened.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.117
Over the past three decades,

00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:44.215
we have lived through a quiet revolution.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:49.182
We've drifted almost without realizing it

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:52.430
from having a market economy

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.397
to becoming market societies.

00:02:56.397 --> 00:02:59.982
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,

00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:01.644
a valuable and effective tool,

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:04.702
for organizing productive activity,

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.760
but a market society is a place where

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.608
almost everything is up for sale.

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:14.060
It's a way of life, in which market thinking

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.781
and market values begin to dominate

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.305
every aspect of life:

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:25.040
personal relations, family life, health, education,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.339
politics, law, civic life.

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:33.830
Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.376
market societies?

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:39.480
For two reasons, I think.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.161
One of them has to do with inequality.

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:47.494
The more things money can buy,

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:51.788
the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:54.645
If the only thing that money determined

00:03:54.645 --> 00:04:00.334
was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:04.686
then inequality wouldn't matter very much.

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:08.113
But when money comes increasingly to govern

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:12.950
access to the essentials of the good life --

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.876
decent health care, access to the best education,

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:21.746
political voice and influence in campaigns --

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.326
when money comes to govern all of those things,

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:27.876
inequality matters a great deal.

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:30.131
And so the marketization of everything

00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.701
sharpens the sting of inequality

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.885
and its social and civic consequence.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.871
That's one reason to worry.

00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.108
There's a second reason

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:45.007
apart from the worry about inequality,

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.326
and it's this:

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:51.250
with some social goods and practices,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.716
when market thinking and market values enter,

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:59.488
they may change the meaning of those practices

00:04:59.488 --> 00:05:02.837
and crowd out attitudes and norms

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.786
worth caring about.

00:05:04.786 --> 00:05:07.410
I'd like to take an example

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.136
of a controversial use of a market mechanism,

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:15.881
a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.046
Many schools struggle with the challenge

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:21.585
of motivating kids, especially kids

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:25.540
from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.579
to do well in school, to apply themselves.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.067
Some economists have proposed a market solution:

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:36.126
Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:38.500
or high test scores

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.451
or for reading books.

00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.233
They've tried this, actually.

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.518
They've done some experiments

00:05:43.518 --> 00:05:46.949
in some major American cities.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.596
In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,

00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:54.307
they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,

00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:56.499
35 dollars for a B.

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:59.673
In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers

00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:04.093
eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:07.012
So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,

00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:10.402
some people are opposed to this cash incentive

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.100
to motivate achievement.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.737
Let's see what people here think about it.

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:19.245
Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:22.230
and someone comes to you with this proposal.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.867
And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.733
You don't have to take it out of your budget.

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:28.015
How many would be in favor

00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:31.609
and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?

00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:33.205
Let's see by a show of hands.

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:36.799
First, how many think it might at least be worth a try

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.695
to see if it would work? Raise your hand.

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:43.426
And how many would be opposed? How many would --

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:46.240
So the majority here are opposed,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.222
but a sizable minority are in favor.

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:50.791
Let's have a discussion.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:53.834
Let's start with those of you who object,

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:56.715
who would rule it out even before trying.

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.336
What would be your reason?

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:02.208
Who will get our discussion started? Yes?

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:04.106
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,

00:07:04.106 --> 00:07:06.873
and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,

00:07:06.873 --> 00:07:12.021
so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,

00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.138
you just take this incentive away

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:17.590
in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.008
Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:25.243
What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?

00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:26.933
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation

00:07:26.933 --> 00:07:28.610
should be to learn.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.753
MS: To learn.
HM: To get to know the world.

00:07:31.753 --> 00:07:34.647
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:36.394
Then they stop reading?

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:39.394
MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:41.742
who thinks it's worth trying this.

00:07:41.742 --> 00:07:43.714
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:47.844
and you said worth a try, so why not try it

00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:51.967
and do the experiment and measure things?

00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:54.140
MS: And measure. And what would you measure?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.861
You'd measure how many --

00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:57.705
EL: How many books they read

00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:00.395
and how many books they continued to read

00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:02.110
after you stopped paying them.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.467
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:05.821
All right, what about that?

00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:07.798
HM: To be frank, I just think

00:08:07.798 --> 00:08:12.431
this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.

00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:18.903
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:21.106
MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion

00:08:21.106 --> 00:08:23.226
is the following question:

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:27.477
Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt

00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:30.666
or crowd out the higher motivation,

00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:35.460
the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.547
which is to learn to love to learn and to read

00:08:39.547 --> 00:08:41.550
for their own sakes?

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.647
And people disagree about what the effect will be,

00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:48.304
but that seems to be the question,

00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:50.340
that somehow a market mechanism

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.201
or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.808
and if it does, what will become of these children later?

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:02.181
I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.

00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:06.699
The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.846
for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.

00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:12.217
The two dollars for each book

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:15.518
did lead those kids to read more books.

00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:18.162
It also led them to read shorter books.

00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:22.340
(Laughter)

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.990
But the real question is,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.562
what will become of these kids later?

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:28.676
Will they have learned that reading is a chore,

00:09:28.676 --> 00:09:31.648
a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,

00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:36.265
or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:41.011
but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?

00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.832
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:49.650
is something that many economists overlook.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.746
Economists often assume

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:54.370
that markets are inert,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.736
that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:01.840
Market exchange, they assume,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.300
doesn't change the meaning or value

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.583
of the goods being exchanged.

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:07.159
This may be true enough

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:09.576
if we're talking about material goods.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:12.082
If you sell me a flat screen television

00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:14.260
or give me one as a gift,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.620
it will be the same good.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.106
It will work the same either way.

00:10:18.106 --> 00:10:20.882
But the same may not be true

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:23.214
if we're talking about nonmaterial goods

00:10:23.214 --> 00:10:27.164
and social practices such as teaching and learning

00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:30.896
or engaging together in civic life.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:34.317
In those domains, bringing market mechanisms

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:38.235
and cash incentives may undermine

00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:42.555
or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes

00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:44.914
worth caring about.

00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:47.138
Once we see

00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:50.849
that markets and commerce,

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:54.510
when extended beyond the material domain,

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.960
can change the character of the goods themselves,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.521
can change the meaning of the social practices,

00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:05.985
as in the example of teaching and learning,

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:10.631
we have to ask where markets belong

00:11:10.631 --> 00:11:12.562
and where they don't,

00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:14.935
where they may actually undermine

00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:17.938
values and attitudes worth caring about.

00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:21.200
But to have this debate,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.698
we have to do something we're not very good at,

00:11:24.698 --> 00:11:28.180
and that is to reason together in public

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.420
about the value and the meaning

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.424
of the social practices we prize,

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:37.929
from our bodies to family life

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.882
to personal relations to health

00:11:39.882 --> 00:11:43.595
to teaching and learning to civic life.

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:46.579
Now these are controversial questions,

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:49.339
and so we tend to shrink from them.

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:52.259
In fact, during the past three decades,

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.756
when market reasoning and market thinking

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:58.244
have gathered force and gained prestige,

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:01.726
our public discourse during this time

00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:03.961
has become hollowed out,

00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:07.667
empty of larger moral meaning.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:10.879
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:14.406
But once we see that markets

00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:16.579
change the character of goods,

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:21.146
we have to debate among ourselves

00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:23.483
these bigger questions

00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:25.443
about how to value goods.

00:12:25.443 --> 00:12:28.438
One of the most corrosive effects

00:12:28.438 --> 00:12:31.225
of putting a price on everything

00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:33.594
is on commonality,

00:12:33.594 --> 00:12:36.772
the sense that we are all in it together.

00:12:36.772 --> 00:12:41.495
Against the background of rising inequality,

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:45.362
marketizing every aspect of life

00:12:45.362 --> 00:12:50.913
leads to a condition where those who are affluent

00:12:50.913 --> 00:12:52.763
and those who are of modest means

00:12:52.763 --> 00:12:57.145
increasingly live separate lives.

00:12:57.145 --> 00:13:00.364
We live and work and shop and play

00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:02.095
in different places.

00:13:02.095 --> 00:13:05.211
Our children go to different schools.

00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:07.760
This isn't good for democracy,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.683
nor is it a satisfying way to live,

00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:13.963
even for those of us who can afford

00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:16.718
to buy our way to the head of the line.

00:13:16.718 --> 00:13:18.491
Here's why.

00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:23.420
Democracy does not require perfect equality,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.183
but what it does require

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:28.811
is that citizens share in a common life.

00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:31.440
What matters is that people

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.209
of different social backgrounds

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:34.933
and different walks of life

00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:37.217
encounter one another,

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.240
bump up against one another

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.730
in the ordinary course of life,

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.454
because this is what teaches us

00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:49.126
to negotiate and to abide our differences.

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:53.340
And this is how we come to care for the common good.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.690
And so, in the end, the question of markets

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.830
is not mainly an economic question.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.918
It's really a question of how we want to live together.

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:09.458
Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,

00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:12.970
or are there certain moral and civic goods

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.899
that markets do not honor

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.693
and money cannot buy?

00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:19.155
Thank you very much.

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:24.340
(Applause)
