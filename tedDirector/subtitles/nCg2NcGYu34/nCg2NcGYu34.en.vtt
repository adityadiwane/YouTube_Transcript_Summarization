00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:19.883
I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:22.387
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:24.307
suffer from it as well.

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:26.404
When I'm walking around an art gallery,

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:28.507
rooms and rooms full of paintings,

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:33.024
after about 15 or 20 minutes,

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.915
I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:36.523
I'm not connecting to them.

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:39.027
Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:42.027
I desperately need to wake me up.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:45.211
I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.587
How many of you out there suffer from --

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:49.592
yes. Ha ha, ha ha!

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:51.742
Now, sometimes you might last longer

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:53.836
than 20 minutes, or even shorter,

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:56.050
but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.131
the accompanying guilt?

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.118
For me, I look at the paintings on the wall

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:04.133
and I think, somebody has decided to put them there,

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.661
thinks they're good enough to be on that wall,

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.019
but I don't always see it.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:10.683
In fact, most of the time I don't see it.

00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:14.457
And I leave feeling actually unhappy.

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:17.924
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself,

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.987
rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:21.444
I think there's something wrong with me.

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.352
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:25.623
(Laughter)

00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:27.932
The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.

00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:30.392
If you think about going into a restaurant,

00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:34.079
when you look at the menu, are you expected to order

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.262
every single thing on the menu?

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.144
No! You select.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.319
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.296
are you going to try on every single shirt

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:45.624
and want every single shirt?

00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:49.751
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.372
How come, then, it's not so expected

00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:54.945
to be selective when we go to an art gallery?

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:58.240
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.944
Well I'm trying to take a different approach.

00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:02.562
And there's two things I do:

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:07.056
When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:11.291
and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.345
that make me slow down for some reason or other.

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:17.146
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:19.203
pulls me like a magnet

00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:22.321
and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.785
So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:28.081
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.771
And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.848
and I tell myself a story about it.

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:38.446
Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired,

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:42.337
our DNA tells us to tell stories.

00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:44.706
We tell stories all the time about everything,

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:49.817
and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:53.768
and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,

00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:55.937
trying to bring some order to it.

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.928
Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:03.643
So I now have this sort of restaurant menu

00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:06.866
visiting of art galleries.

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:10.074
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:13.138
that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks

00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:15.684
and want to tell stories about them.

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:19.235
The first one needs little introduction --

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:22.266
"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.422
17th-century Dutch painter.

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:26.922
This is the most glorious painting.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:29.066
I first saw it when I was 19,

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.346
and I immediately went out and got a poster of it,

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:35.503
and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.

00:03:35.503 --> 00:03:38.653
It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,

00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:40.997
I never tire of looking at her.

00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:44.776
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:47.333
was just the gorgeous colors he uses

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.277
and the light falling on her face.

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:52.061
But I think what's kept me still coming back

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.117
year after year is another thing, and that is

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:58.811
the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:01.229
I can't tell if she's happy or sad,

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.196
and I change my mind all the time.

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:07.795
So that keeps me coming back.

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:11.804
One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:14.486
I lay in bed and looked at her,

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.065
and I suddenly thought, I wonder what

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:20.983
the painter did to her to make her look like that.

00:04:20.983 --> 00:04:23.927
And it was the first time I'd ever thought that

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:26.727
the expression on her face is actually reflecting

00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:28.866
how she feels about him.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:32.022
Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:36.791
Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.623
And I thought, well, what is that relationship?

00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:42.831
So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:45.156
we have no idea who she is.

00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:47.503
In fact, we don't know who any of the models

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:49.863
in any of Vermeer's paintings are,

00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:51.990
and we know very little about Vermeer himself.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.764
Which made me go, "Yippee!"

00:04:54.764 --> 00:04:59.423
I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.

00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:02.019
So here's how I came up with the story.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:03.896
First of all, I thought,

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.988
I've got to get her into the house.

00:05:05.988 --> 00:05:08.476
How does Vermeer know her?

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.020
Well, there've been suggestions that

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.443
she is his 12-year-old daughter.

00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:16.668
The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.

00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:19.364
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,

00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:21.548
but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.

00:05:21.548 --> 00:05:23.388
For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,

00:05:23.388 --> 00:05:26.980
if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.868
It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer

00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:30.764
to paint his daughter like that.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.644
So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:34.894
close to him, physically close to him.

00:05:34.894 --> 00:05:37.158
Well, who else would be in the house?

00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:40.541
A servant, a lovely servant.

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.102
So, she's in the house.

00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:44.763
How do we get her into the studio?

00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:46.897
We don't know very much about Vermeer,

00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:49.036
but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:52.027
is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother

00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:54.300
in a house where he had his own room

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.583
where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.660
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.604
And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,

00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:08.468
you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:12.364
How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?

00:06:12.364 --> 00:06:14.660
Well, he compartmentalizes his life.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.340
He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.068
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."

00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:30.119
She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.199
And he decides to paint her.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.467
He has her wear very plain clothes.

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:37.838
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings

00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:43.804
wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:46.324
This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain

00:06:46.324 --> 00:06:48.364
is her pearl earring.

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:51.811
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.018
a pair of pearl earrings.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:57.280
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.321
We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.937
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur,

00:07:05.937 --> 00:07:07.684
a yellow and black bodice,

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:11.378
and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,

00:07:11.378 --> 00:07:14.492
different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.

00:07:14.492 --> 00:07:18.970
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.489
It's not such a leap of faith to take

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:25.073
that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.

00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:28.250
So we've got all the elements for our story.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.680
She's in the studio with him for a long time.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.723
These paintings took a long time to make.

00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:35.594
They would have spent the time alone, all that time.

00:07:35.594 --> 00:07:37.594
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.

00:07:37.594 --> 00:07:40.409
She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:43.201
And does the wife know? Maybe not.

00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:46.579
And if she doesn't, well --

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:48.434
that's the story.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.611
(Laughter)

00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:53.201
The next painting I'm going to talk about

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.448
is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.

00:07:56.448 --> 00:08:00.824
He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,

00:08:00.824 --> 00:08:03.417
but he did occasionally paint people.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:07.384
And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,

00:08:07.384 --> 00:08:11.344
different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.

00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:14.808
I like this version the best, because some of the boys

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:18.201
are older and some are younger, and to me, this one,

00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:21.153
like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.

00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:25.144
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.

00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:29.937
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:34.420
and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.137
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.

00:08:38.137 --> 00:08:40.760
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.984
in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:45.996
and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:47.203
I was standing there going,

00:08:47.203 --> 00:08:50.156
"Look at me. Please look at me."

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:52.892
And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:55.644
and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,

00:08:55.644 --> 00:09:00.134
he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.

00:09:00.134 --> 00:09:04.027
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:08.004
of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.

00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:09.525
He's never going to look at me.

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:11.204
So I was thinking of a story where,

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:14.420
if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.622
Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:19.148
I'm thinking of an older version of himself.

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:25.093
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,

00:09:25.093 --> 00:09:27.564
saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about

00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:30.014
what you're about to go through. Please look at me."

00:09:30.014 --> 00:09:31.540
And he never does.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.343
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" --

00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:37.387
we don't know if she's happy or sad.

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:39.036
I've written an entire novel about her,

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.036
and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:43.140
Again and again, back to the painting,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.821
looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.268
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,

00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:57.083
but not really, and we come back again and again.

00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:59.621
The last painting I'm going to talk about

00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:04.485
is called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:07.536
This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.

00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:10.149
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.813
and then they discovered that it wasn't him,

00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:14.413
and they have no idea who it is.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.556
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery,

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:18.325
if you don't know the biography of the painting,

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:19.949
it's kind of useless to you.

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:22.373
They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.

00:10:22.373 --> 00:10:27.277
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:29.421
along with quite a number of other orphans,

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.932
some of them some beautiful paintings.

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:36.935
This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:39.812
One is the disconnection between his mouth

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:42.517
that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.524
He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?

00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:49.241
The second thing that really attracted me

00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:50.957
were his bright red cheeks.

00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:54.564
He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!

00:10:54.564 --> 00:10:57.598
This must be a guy who blushes all the time.

00:10:57.598 --> 00:10:59.740
What is he thinking about that's making him blush?

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.516
The third thing that made me stop in my tracks

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:06.316
is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.

00:11:06.316 --> 00:11:09.884
Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.

00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.516
And you know what it makes me think of,

00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:16.308
is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.964
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,

00:11:18.964 --> 00:11:21.724
and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,

00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:24.332
and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?

00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:26.604
And I thought, if I'm going to make a story,

00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:28.588
what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:32.218
Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?

00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:34.148
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:38.292
He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:41.941
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?

00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:45.821
You put all those together, and you've got your story

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:49.175
to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:53.896
Now, here's the story.

00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:56.826
It's short.

00:11:56.826 --> 00:11:59.557
"Rosy"

00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:03.607
I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.

00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:07.918
It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves

00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:11.094
and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,

00:12:11.094 --> 00:12:14.020
set close together so that the fit is snug.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.583
The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.

00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:21.333
Perhaps that was the intention.

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:26.251
I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.

00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.077
I knew even before I stood up to speak

00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:30.646
that my cheeks were inflamed.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:34.347
I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,

00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:36.702
from wine, from high emotion.

00:12:36.702 --> 00:12:41.167
As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:43.614
but not by George.

00:12:43.614 --> 00:12:46.688
Only George could call me Rosy.

00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:48.847
I would not allow anyone else.

00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:53.071
He managed to make the word tender.

00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:55.870
When I made the announcement, George did not

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.934
turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.

00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:00.838
He should not have been surprised.

00:13:00.838 --> 00:13:02.510
It has been a common assumption

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.358
that I would one day marry his cousin.

00:13:06.358 --> 00:13:08.942
But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.

00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:12.243
I know, I could barely utter them.

00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:16.645
Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:21.902
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:26.127
We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:28.389
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:33.833
He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:35.837
"We will still see each other," I insisted.

00:13:35.837 --> 00:13:39.125
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:40.861
Nothing need change."

00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:44.578
George did not speak.

00:13:44.578 --> 00:13:47.972
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry

00:13:47.972 --> 00:13:52.077
and produce an heir. It is expected of me."

00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:55.658
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.

00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:59.741
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:04.577
I'm sure you'll be content together."

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:07.894
He never used my nickname again.

00:14:07.894 --> 00:14:09.653
Thank you.

00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:13.035
(Applause)

00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:14.217
Thank you.

00:14:14.217 --> 00:14:15.764
(Applause)
