00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:17.042
We lost a lot of time at school
learning spelling.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:23.789
Kids are still losing a lot of time
at school with spelling.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.056
That's why I want to share
a question with you:

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.651
Do we need new spelling rules?

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:35.686
I believe that yes, we do.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.340
Or even better, I think we need
to simplify the ones we already have.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.285
Neither the question nor the answer
are new in the Spanish language.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.523
They have been bouncing around
from century to century

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:55.150
since 1492, when in the first grammar
guide of the Spanish language,

00:00:55.174 --> 00:01:00.916
Antonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple
principle for our spelling:

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.859
"... thus, we have to write words
as we pronounce them,

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:06.263
and pronounce words as we write them."

00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:09.589
Each sound was to correspond
to one letter,

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:12.938
each letter was to represent
a single sound,

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:18.165
and those which did not represent
any sound should be removed.

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:21.792
This approach, the phonetic approach,

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:25.433
which says we have to write
words as we pronounce them,

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:30.166
both is and isn't at the root of spelling
as we practice it today.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:36.222
It is, because the Spanish language,
in contrast to English, French or others,

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:41.557
always strongly resisted
writing words too differently

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.279
to how we pronounce them.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.572
But the phonetic approach
is also absent today,

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:48.932
because when, in the 18th century,
we decided how we would standardize

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.168
our writing,

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:54.205
there was another approach which guided
a good part of the decisions.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.071
It was the etymological approach,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.288
the one that says we have to write words

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:02.466
according to how they were written
in their original language,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.032
in Latin, in Greek.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:08.856
That's how we ended up with silent H's,
which we write but don't pronounce.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.168
That's how we have B's and V's that,
contrary to what many people believe,

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:17.859
were never differentiated
in Spanish pronunciation.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.328
That's how we wound up with G's,

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:23.033
that are sometimes aspirated,
as in "gente,"

00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:25.438
and other times unaspirated, as in "gato."

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:28.972
That's how we ended up
with C's, S's and Z's,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.038
three letters that in some places
correspond to one sound,

00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:36.027
and in others, to two,
but nowhere to three.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.598
I'm not here to tell you anything
you don't know from your own experience.

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:46.137
We all went to school,

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.808
we all invested big amounts
of learning time,

00:02:50.832 --> 00:02:55.530
big amounts of pliant,
childlike brain time

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:57.161
in dictation,

00:02:57.185 --> 00:03:02.216
in the memorization of spelling rules
filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.526
We were told in many ways,
implicitly and explicitly,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.240
that in spelling, something fundamental
to our upbringing was at stake.

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:15.382
Yet, I have the feeling

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:19.041
that teachers didn't ask themselves
why it was so important.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.193
In fact, they didn't ask themselves
a previous question:

00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:24.759
What is the purpose of spelling?

00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:28.685
What do we need spelling for?

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.356
And the truth is, when someone
asks themselves this question,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.469
the answer is much simpler
and less momentous

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:37.926
than we'd usually believe.

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:45.211
We use spelling to unify the way we write,
so we can all write the same way,

00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:49.593
making it easier for us to understand
when we read to each other.

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:55.799
But unlike in other aspects of language
such as punctuation,

00:03:55.823 --> 00:04:01.922
in spelling, there's no
individual expression involved.

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:03.390
In punctuation, there is.

00:04:03.937 --> 00:04:07.893
With punctuation, I can choose
to change the meaning of a phrase.

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:13.342
With punctuation, I can impose
a particular rhythm to what I am writing,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:15.605
but not with spelling.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.206
When it comes to spelling,
it's either wrong or right,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.824
according to whether it conforms
or not to the current rules.

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:28.868
But then, wouldn't it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules

00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:34.864
so it would be easier to teach, learn
and use spelling correctly?

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:40.005
Wouldn't it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:45.381
so that all the time we devote today
to teaching spelling,

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.473
we could devote to other language issues

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:52.464
whose complexities do, in fact,
deserve the time and effort?

00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:59.217
What I propose is not to abolish spelling,

00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:03.233
and have everyone write however they want.

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:07.618
Language is a tool of common usage,

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:12.974
and so I believe it's fundamental
that we use it following common criteria.

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:15.601
But I also find it fundamental

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:19.971
that those common criteria
be as simple as possible,

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:23.829
especially because
if we simplify our spelling,

00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:26.666
we're not leveling it down;

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.363
when spelling is simplified,

00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:33.165
the quality of the language
doesn't suffer at all.

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:37.838
I work every day with Spanish
Golden Age literature,

00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:41.466
I read Garcilaso, Cervantes,
Góngora, Quevedo,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.437
who sometimes write "hombre" without H,

00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:47.689
sometimes write "escribir" with V,

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:50.152
and it's absolutely clear to me

00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:55.577
that the difference between those texts
and ours is one of convention,

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.194
or rather, a lack of convention
during their time.

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:01.247
But it's not a difference of quality.

00:06:02.164 --> 00:06:04.588
But let me go back to the masters,

00:06:04.612 --> 00:06:07.966
because they're key characters
in this story.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.431
Earlier, I mentioned this slightly
thoughtless insistence

00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:16.369
with which teachers pester and pester us

00:06:16.393 --> 00:06:17.893
over spelling.

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:21.389
But the truth is,
things being as they are,

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:23.705
this makes perfect sense.

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.068
In our society, spelling serves
as an index of privilege,

00:06:29.092 --> 00:06:33.480
separating the cultured from the brute,
the educated from the ignorant,

00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:38.492
independent of the content
that's being written.

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.827
One can get or not get a job

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.520
because of an H that one put or did not.

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:47.733
One can become
an object of public ridicule

00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:50.408
because of a misplaced B.

00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:52.608
Therefore, in this context,

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:57.705
of course, it makes sense to dedicate
all this time to spelling.

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.267
But we shouldn't forget

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.491
that throughout the history
of our language,

00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:04.455
it has always been teachers

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.404
or people involved
in the early learning of language

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.948
who promoted spelling reforms,

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:15.411
who realized that in our spelling
there was often an obstacle

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.824
to the transmission of knowledge.

00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:19.515
In our case, for example,

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.092
Sarmiento, together with Andrés Bello,
spearheaded the biggest spelling reform

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:27.521
to take place in the Spanish language:

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:32.055
the mid-19th century Chilean reform.

00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:38.175
Then, why not take over
the task of those teachers

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:41.592
and start making progress in our spelling?

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:44.868
Here, in this intimate group of 10,000,

00:07:44.892 --> 00:07:46.446
I'd like to bring to the table

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.941
some changes that I find reasonable
to start discussing.

00:07:52.027 --> 00:07:54.395
Let's remove the silent H.

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:59.507
In places where we write an H
but pronounce nothing,

00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:00.822
let's not write anything.

00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:01.862
(Applause)

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:04.524
It's hard for me to imagine
what sentimental attachment

00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:09.539
can justify to someone
all the hassle caused by the silent H.

00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:11.908
B and V, as we said before,

00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:14.802
were never differentiated
in the Spanish language --

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:15.843
(Applause)

00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:19.172
Let's choose one; it could be either.
We can discuss it, talk it over.

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:22.826
Everyone will have their preferences
and can make their arguments.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.694
Let's keep one, remove the other.

00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:28.725
G and J, let's separate their roles.

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:33.171
G should keep the unaspirated sound,
like in "gato," "mago," and "águila,"

00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:36.491
and J should keep the aspirated sound,

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:41.409
as in "jarabe," "jirafa,"
"gente," "argentino."

00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.589
The case of C, S and Z is interesting,

00:08:47.613 --> 00:08:51.450
because it shows that the phonetic
approach must be a guide,

00:08:51.474 --> 00:08:54.539
but it can't be an absolute principle.

00:08:54.563 --> 00:08:59.322
In some cases, the differences
in pronunciation must be addressed.

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:02.252
As I said before, C, S and Z,

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.618
in some places, correspond
to one sound, in others to two.

00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:10.828
If we go from three letters
to two, we're all better off.

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:16.937
To some, these changes
may seem a bit drastic.

00:09:16.961 --> 00:09:19.142
They're really not.

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:22.429
The Royal Spanish Academy,
all of language academies,

00:09:22.453 --> 00:09:27.358
also believes that spelling
should be progressively modified;

00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:32.268
that language is linked to history,
tradition and custom,

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:36.915
but that at the same time,
it is a practical everyday tool

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:41.833
and that sometimes this attachment
to history, tradition and custom

00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:46.941
becomes an obstacle for its current usage.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:49.548
Indeed, this explains the fact

00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:56.525
that our language, much more than
the others we are geographically close to,

00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:00.077
has been historically
modifying itself based on us,

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:03.755
for example, we went
from "ortographia" to "ortografía,"

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:07.880
from "theatro" to "teatro,"
from "quantidad" to "cantidad,"

00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:10.292
from "symbolo" to "símbolo."

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:15.723
And some silent H's are slowly
being stealthily removed:

00:10:15.747 --> 00:10:17.987
in the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,

00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:23.803
"arpa" and "armonía" can be written
with or without an H.

00:10:23.827 --> 00:10:25.327
And everybody is OK.

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:30.020
I also believe

00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:35.989
that this is a particularly appropriate
moment to have this discussion.

00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:41.228
It's always said that language
changes spontaneously,

00:10:41.252 --> 00:10:43.118
from the bottom up,

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:46.415
that its users are the ones
who incorporate new words

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:49.974
and who introduce grammatical changes,

00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:53.815
and that the authority --
in some places an academy,

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.750
in others a dictionary,
in others a ministry --

00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:01.600
accepts and incorporates them
long after the fact.

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:06.044
This is true only
for some levels of language.

00:11:06.068 --> 00:11:09.463
It is true on the lexical level,
the level of words.

00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:12.741
It is less true on the grammatical level,

00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:16.951
and I would almost say
it is not true for the spelling level,

00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:21.016
that has historically changed
from the top down.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.075
Institutions have always been the ones
to establish the rules

00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:27.439
and propose changes.

00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:33.753
Why do I say this is a particularly
appropriate moment?

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.145
Until today,

00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:41.309
writing always had a much more restricted
and private use than speech.

00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:46.412
But in our time,
the age of social networks,

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:49.583
this is going through
a revolutionary change.

00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:53.175
Never before have people written so much;

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:57.747
never before have people written
for so many others to see.

00:11:58.356 --> 00:12:01.473
And in these social networks,
for the first time,

00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:06.537
we're seeing innovative uses
of spelling on a large scale,

00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:11.170
where even more-than-educated people
with impeccable spelling,

00:12:11.194 --> 00:12:13.474
when using social networks,

00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:19.047
behave a lot like the majority of users
of social networks behave.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:22.753
That is to say, they slack
on spell-checking

00:12:22.777 --> 00:12:27.612
and prioritize speed and efficacy
in communication.

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:33.560
For now, on social networks,
we see chaotic, individual usages.

00:12:33.584 --> 00:12:36.601
But I think we have
to pay attention to them,

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.972
because they're probably telling us

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:43.594
that an era that designates
a new place for writing

00:12:43.618 --> 00:12:47.927
seeks new criteria for that writing.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:53.386
I think we'd be wrong
to reject them, to discard them,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.382
because we identify them as symptoms
of the cultural decay of our times.

00:12:58.406 --> 00:13:03.344
No, I believe we have to observe them,
organize them and channel them

00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:09.030
within guidelines that better correspond
to the needs of our times.

00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:14.293
I can anticipate some objections.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:16.774
There will be those who'll say

00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:21.908
that if we simplify spelling
we'll lose etymology.

00:13:22.743 --> 00:13:25.833
Strictly speaking, if we wanted
to preserve etymology,

00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:28.287
it would go beyond just spelling.

00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:32.316
We'd also have to learn
Latin, Greek, Arabic.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.690
With simplified spelling,

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:40.904
we would normalize etymology
in the same place we do now:

00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:43.277
in etymological dictionaries.

00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:46.944
A second objection will come
from those who say:

00:13:46.968 --> 00:13:50.686
"If we simplify spelling,
we'll stop distinguishing

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.386
between words that differ
in just one letter."

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.500
That is true, but it's not a problem.

00:13:58.524 --> 00:14:03.500
Our language has homonyms,
words with more than one meaning,

00:14:03.524 --> 00:14:06.286
yet we don't confuse
the "banco" where we sit

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.382
with the "banco" where we deposit money,

00:14:08.406 --> 00:14:11.655
or the "traje" that we wear
with the things we "trajimos."

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:18.318
In the vast majority of situations,
context dispels any confusion.

00:14:19.012 --> 00:14:21.965
But there's a third objection.

00:14:23.922 --> 00:14:25.094
To me,

00:14:26.873 --> 00:14:30.318
it's the most understandable,
even the most moving.

00:14:30.342 --> 00:14:33.810
It's the people who'll say:
"I don't want to change.

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:38.065
I was brought up like this,
I got used to doing it this way,

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:44.362
when I read a written word
in simplified spelling, my eyes hurt."

00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:46.187
(Laughter)

00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:51.084
This objection is, in part, in all of us.

00:14:52.003 --> 00:14:53.492
What do I think we should do?

00:14:53.516 --> 00:14:56.225
The same thing that's always
done in these cases:

00:14:56.249 --> 00:15:01.662
changes are made looking forward;
children are taught the new rules,

00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:06.219
those of us who don't want to adapt
can write the way we're used to writing,

00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:10.544
and hopefully, time will cement
the new rules in place.

00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:17.591
The success of every spelling reform
that affects deeply rooted habits

00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:22.921
lies in caution, agreement,
gradualism and tolerance.

00:15:23.483 --> 00:15:27.801
At the same time, can't allow
the attachment to old customs

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:30.140
impede us from moving forward.

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:34.031
The best tribute we can pay to the past

00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:36.569
is to improve upon what it's given us.

00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:39.648
So I believe that we must
reach an agreement,

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.683
that academies must reach an agreement,

00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:45.645
and purge from our spelling rules

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:49.374
all the habits we practice
just for the sake of tradition,

00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:51.059
even if they are useless now.

00:15:51.505 --> 00:15:54.981
I'm convinced that if we do that

00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:59.005
in the humble but extremely
important realm of language,

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:04.363
we'll be leaving a better future
to the next generations.

00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:08.350
(Applause)
