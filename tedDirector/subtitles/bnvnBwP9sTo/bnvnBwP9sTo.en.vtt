00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:16.276
My name is Katrina Spade,
and I grew up in a medical family

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.140
where it was fairly normal to talk
about death and dying at the dinner table.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.476
But I didn't go into medicine
like so many of my family members.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.580
Instead, I went to architecture school
to learn how to design.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.116
And while I was there,
I began to be curious

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.700
about what would happen
to my physical body after I died.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.540
What would my nearest
and dearest do with me?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.516
So if the existence
and the fact of your own mortality

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.236
doesn't get you down,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.700
the state of our current
funerary practices will.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.500
Today, almost 50 percent of Americans
choose conventional burial.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.636
Conventional burial begins with embalming,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.436
where funeral staff drain bodily fluid

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.316
and replace it with a mixture
designed to preserve the corpse

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.380
and give it a lifelike glow.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.796
Then, as you know,
bodies are buried in a casket

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.996
in a concrete-lined grave

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.220
in a cemetery.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.596
All told, in US cemeteries,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.380
we bury enough metal
to build a Golden Gate Bridge,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.836
enough wood to build
1,800 single family homes,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.636
and enough formaldehyde-laden
embalming fluid

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.700
to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.980
In addition, cemeteries
all over the world are reaching capacity.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.356
Turns out, it doesn't really
make good business sense

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.916
to sell someone
a piece of land for eternity.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.956
(Laughter)

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.596
Whose idea was that?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.300
In some places, you can't buy a plot
no matter how much money you have.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.580
As a result, cremation rates
have risen fast.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.156
In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother
be incinerated after she died,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.580
you'd probably be kicked
from the family deathbed.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.996
But today, almost half
of Americans choose cremation,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.340
citing simpler,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.916
cheaper

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.900
and more ecological as reasons.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.316
I used to think that cremation
was a sustainable form of disposition,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.140
but just think about it for a second.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.676
Cremation destroys the potential we have

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.140
to give back to the earth
after we've died.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.436
It uses an energy-intensive process
to turn bodies into ash,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.620
polluting the air
and contributing to climate change.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.916
All told, cremations in the US

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.236
emit a staggering 600 million
pounds of carbon dioxide

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.940
into the atmosphere annually.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.236
The truly awful truth

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.140
is that the very last thing
that most of us will do on this earth

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.060
is poison it.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.636
It's like we've created, accepted
and death-denied our way into a status quo

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.276
that puts as much distance
between ourselves and nature

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.940
as is humanly possible.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.276
Our modern funerary practices
are designed to stave off

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.980
the natural processes
that happen to a body after death.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.740
In other words, they're meant
to prevent us from decomposing.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.956
But the truth

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.580
is that nature is really,
really good at death.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.636
We've all seen it.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.396
When organic material dies in nature,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.156
microbes and bacteria
break it down into nutrient-rich soil,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.740
completing the life cycle.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.980
In nature, death creates life.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.300
Back in architecture school,
I was thinking about all this,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.060
and I set out on a plan
to redesign death care.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.876
Could I create a system

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.756
that was beneficial to the earth

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.340
and that used nature as a guide
rather than something to be feared?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.620
Something that was gentle to the planet?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.916
That planet, after all,
supports our living bodies

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.660
our whole lives.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.476
And while I was mulling this all over

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.700
over the drawing board,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.620
the phone rang.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.540
It was my friend Kate.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.076
She was like, "Hey,
have you heard about the farmers

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.380
who are composting whole cows?"

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.315
And I was like, "Mmmm."

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:33.099
(Laughter)

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.396
Turns out that farmers
in agricultural institutions

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.836
have been practicing something
called livestock mortality composting

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.396
for decades.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.396
Mortality composting is where
you take an animal high in nitrogen

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.580
and cover it with co-composting materials
that are high in carbon.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.236
It's an aerobic process,
so it requires oxygen,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.580
and it requires
plenty of moisture as well.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.996
In the most basic setup, a cow
is covered with a few feet of wood chips,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.356
which are high in carbon,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.676
and left outside for nature,
for breezes to provide oxygen

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.460
and rain to provide moisture.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.836
In about nine months,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.900
all that remains
is a nutrient-rich compost.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.196
The flesh has been decomposed entirely,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.780
as have the bones.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.556
I know.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.076
(Laughter)

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.276
So I would definitely
call myself a decomposition nerd,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.380
but I am far, far from a scientist,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.876
and one way you can tell this is true

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.196
is that I have often called
the process of composting "magic."

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.076
(Laughter)

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.540
So basically, all we humans need to do

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.260
is create the right environment
for nature to do its job.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.356
It's like the opposite
of antibacterial soap.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.636
Instead of fighting them,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.980
we welcome microbes and bacteria
in with open arms.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.396
These tiny, amazing creatures

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.436
break down molecules
into smaller molecules and atoms,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.780
which are then incorporated
into new molecules.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.340
In other words, that cow is transformed.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.540
It's no longer a cow.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.220
It's been cycled back into nature.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.580
See? Magic.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.316
You can probably imagine
the light bulb that went off in my head

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.912
after I received that phone call.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.236
I began designing a system

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.340
based on the principles
of livestock mortality composting

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.540
that would take human beings
and transform them into soil.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.556
Fast-forward five years

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.796
and the project has grown in ways
I truly never could have imagined.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.276
We've created a scalable,
replicable non-profit urban model

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.796
based on the science
of livestock mortality composting

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.300
that turns human beings into soil.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.756
We've partnered and collaborated
with experts in soil science,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.316
decomposition, alternative death care,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.740
law and architecture.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.881
We've raised funds
from foundations and individuals

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.436
in order to design
a prototype of this system,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.236
and we've heard from tens of thousands
of people all over the world

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.500
who want this option to be available.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.116
OK.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.956
In the next few years,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.876
it's our goal to build the first
full-scale human composting facility

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.676
right in the city of Seattle.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.540
(Applause)

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.900
Imagine it,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.636
part public park,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.396
part funeral home,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.116
part memorial to the people we love,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.236
a place where we can reconnect
with the cycles of nature

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.060
and treat bodies
with gentleness and respect.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.396
The infrastructure is simple.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.036
Inside a vertical core,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.156
bodies and wood chips undergo
accelerated natural decomposition,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.476
or composting,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.220
and are transformed into soil.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.420
When someone dies, their body
is taken to a human composting facility.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.076
After wrapping the deceased
in a simple shroud,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.140
friends and family carry the body
to the top of the core,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.860
which contains the natural
decomposition system.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.356
During a laying in ceremony,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.756
they gently place the body into the core

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.161
and cover it with wood chips.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.140
This begins the gentle transformation
from human to soil.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.180
Over the next few weeks,
the body decomposes naturally.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.556
Microbes and bacteria
break down carbon, then protein,

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.676
to create a new substance,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.100
a rich, earthy soil.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.980
This soil can then be used
to grow new life.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.300
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:02.556
(Applause)

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.796
Yeah, thank you.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.180
(Applause)

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.236
Who's thinking about
lemon meringue pie right now?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.396
(Laughter)

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.620
A lemon drop?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.740
Something stronger?

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.356
So in addition to housing the core,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.076
these buildings will function
to support the grieving

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.700
by providing space for memorial services
and end-of-life planning.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.916
The potential for repurposing is huge.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.556
Old churches and industrial warehouses
can be converted into places

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.220
where we create soil and honor life.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.796
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.596
that's been diluted
over the past hundred years

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.716
as cremation rates have risen

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.380
and religious affiliation has declined.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.796
Our Seattle facility will function
as a model for these places

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.420
all over the world.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.076
We've heard from communities
in South Africa, Australia,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.020
the UK, Canada and beyond.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.156
We're creating a design toolkit

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.380
that will help others
design and build facilities

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.636
that will contain technical specifications

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.380
and regulatory best practices.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.396
We want to help individuals,
organizations,

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.636
and down the road, municipalities

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.620
design and build facilities
in their own cities.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.836
The idea is that every one of these places
should look and feel completely different

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.756
with the same system inside.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.836
They're really meant to be designed
for the neighborhood in which they reside

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.780
and the community which they serve.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.516
The other idea is
for supportive staff to be on hand

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.100
to help families with the care
and preparation of loved ones' bodies.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.756
We're banishing practices
that bewilder and disempower

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.260
and creating a system
that is beautiful and meaningful

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.460
and transparent.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.556
We believe that access
to ecological death care

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.780
is a human right.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.556
OK, so you know the old saying,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.156
if you can compost a cow,
you can compost a human?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.180
(Laughter)

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.580
Turns out, it's true.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.196
Since 2014, we've been
running a pilot project

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.076
in the hills of North Carolina

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.020
with the Forensic Anthropology Department
at Western Carolina University.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.396
Six donor bodies
have been covered in wood chips,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.716
oxygen provided by breezes,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.020
microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.756
This pilot program has allowed us
to demonstrate that it's possible

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.476
to harness the incredible power
of natural decomposition

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.420
to turn human bodies into soil,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.620
and we're working
with other universities as well.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.180
Soil scientists
at Washington State University,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.876
the grad students, anyway,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.956
are working to compost
teeth with amalgam fillings

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.900
so that we can understand
what happens to the mercury therein.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.916
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.396
to determine what happens
to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.156
during the composting process,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.540
and whether additional
remediation will be needed.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.196
By the way,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.716
composting creates a great deal of heat,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.100
especially this particular
type of composting.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.476
One week after we began
composting our fifth donor body,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.636
the temperature inside
that mound of wood chips

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.740
reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.956
Imagine harnessing that heat
to create energy

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.420
or comfort the grieving on a cold day.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.700
The death care revolution has begun.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.500
It's an exciting time to be alive.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.676
Thank you.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.180
(Applause)
