00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:20.029
Shall I ask for a show
of hands or a clapping

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.504
of people in different generations?

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:27.236
I'm interested in how many
are three to 12 years old.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.510
(Laughter)

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:33.820
None, huh?

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:35.219
(Laughter)

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:36.450
All right.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.827
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.236
Do you remember dinosaurs
when you were that age?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.727
(Applause)

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.236
Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.757
(Laughter)

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.690
We're going to kind of go
in a different direction right now.

00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:58.236
I hope you all realize that.

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:01.045
So I'll just give you my message up front:

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:03.230
Try not to go extinct.

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:04.592
(Laughter)

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:05.802
That's it.

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:10.236
(Laughter)

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.377
People ask me a lot --

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.926
in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.236
is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.236
What's the fascination?

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.236
And I usually just say,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.236
"Well, dinosaurs were big,

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.236
different and gone."

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:31.754
They're all gone.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:33.236
Well that's not true,

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:35.983
but we'll get to the goose in a minute.

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:38.504
So that's sort of the theme:

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:41.158
big, different and gone.

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.069
The title of my talk:

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:46.135
Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.236
The cause of a premature extinction.

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:52.054
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.981
And there's lots of different shapes.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.458
Lots of different kinds.

00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:59.236
A long time ago,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.098
back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:07.235
They went out and gathered them up.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.628
And this is an interesting story.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:14.494
Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had.

00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:21.306
So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.274
then the museum in Ottawa
wanted a bigger one, and a better one.

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:27.880
And that happened for all museums.

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:31.965
So everyone was out looking
for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.378
And this was in the early 1900s.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.236
By about 1970,

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:44.421
some scientists were sitting around
and they thought, "What in the world --

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:47.374
Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:50.854
Where are all the little ones?"

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.688
(Laughter)

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:57.350
And they thought about it
and they even wrote papers about it:

00:02:57.374 --> 00:02:59.236
"Where are the little dinosaurs?"

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.715
(Laughter)

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.236
Well, go to a museum, you'll see,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.236
see how many baby dinosaurs there are.

00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:17.709
People assumed --
and this was actually a problem --

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:22.037
people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs,

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.763
if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify.

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:29.660
You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:30.985
(Laughter)

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:33.236
But all they had were big dinosaurs.

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.236
And it comes down to a couple of things.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.403
First off, scientists have egos,

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:44.236
and scientists like to name dinosaurs.

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:46.236
They like to name anything.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.217
Everybody likes to have
their own animal that they named.

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.218
(Laughter)

00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:56.549
And so every time they found something
that looked a little different,

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.426
they named it something different.

00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:00.330
And what happened, of course,

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:04.021
is we ended up with a whole
bunch of different dinosaurs.

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:08.236
In 1975,

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:11.764
a light went on in somebody's head.

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.314
Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:23.095
actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do,

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:27.482
which is different
than the way reptiles grow.

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.086
And in fact,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.626
he used the cassowary as an example.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.701
And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary,

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:38.952
or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads,

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:45.611
they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow.

00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:48.236
Now think about that.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.236
They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.780
very late in what we call ontogeny.

00:04:54.804 --> 00:05:00.734
So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.692
So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown

00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:12.146
and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.688
you would think
they were two different animals.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.236
So this was a problem,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.816
and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs

00:05:24.322 --> 00:05:25.823
then called Hypacrosaurus.

00:05:25.847 --> 00:05:30.713
And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:34.038
and make an average
of what it should look like,

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:36.798
if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,

00:05:37.313 --> 00:05:41.254
it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult.

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:47.317
But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.236
So this was interesting.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.712
So this is where people went astray again.

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:57.978
I mean, if they'd have just taken that,

00:05:58.002 --> 00:06:01.020
taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that,

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:04.235
then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have.

00:06:04.918 --> 00:06:08.692
But scientists have egos;
they like to name things.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.403
And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different.

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:18.058
Now we have a way of actually testing

00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:23.001
to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one.

00:06:23.401 --> 00:06:26.652
And that's by actually
cutting into their bones.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:33.923
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine,

00:06:33.947 --> 00:06:38.991
because in museums, bones are precious.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:43.960
You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them.

00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:47.052
They put them in foam, little containers.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.344
They're very well taken care of.

00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:55.346
They don't like it if you come in
and want to saw them open and look inside.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.371
(Laughter)

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:59.804
So they don't normally let you do that.

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:00.829
(Laughter)

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:04.299
But I have a museum
and I collect dinosaurs

00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:07.251
and I can saw mine open.

00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:09.252
So that's what I do.

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:13.951
(Applause)

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.622
So if you cut open a little dinosaur,

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.336
it's very spongy inside, like A.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.236
And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.337
You can tell it's mature bone.

00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:29.397
So it's real easy to tell them apart.

00:07:29.864 --> 00:07:33.569
So what I want to do is show you these.

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:37.494
In North America in the northern plains
of the United States

00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:41.236
and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.986
there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.461
that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth.

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:51.409
And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes --

00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:55.235
I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct.

00:07:55.873 --> 00:07:58.582
And so we will evaluate them.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:01.355
And that's sort of what I've been doing.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:06.510
So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open.

00:08:07.074 --> 00:08:10.917
Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing,

00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:14.000
but when you go to a museum

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:18.235
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?"

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:21.236
they say, "Go away."

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.236
(Laughter)

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.236
So here are 12 dinosaurs.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.483
And we want to look at these three first.

00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:37.379
So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus.

00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:41.033
And everybody knows
that these three animals are related.

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:47.358
And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever.

00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:53.218
But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related.

00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:54.466
In other words,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.236
people looked at them
and they saw the differences.

00:08:57.845 --> 00:09:01.236
And you all know
that if you are going to determine

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.166
whether you're related
to your brother or your sister,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.236
you can't do it by looking at differences.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.451
You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities.

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:13.474
So people were looking at these

00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:15.931
and they were talking
about how different they are.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.379
Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head,

00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:22.100
and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head,

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:25.236
and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.806
And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.996
has spikes sticking out
the back of its head.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.992
It's got a little, tiny dome,

00:09:36.016 --> 00:09:38.841
and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose.

00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:43.236
And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia.

00:09:44.487 --> 00:09:45.917
Guess where that came from?

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:47.105
Dragon.

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:50.881
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
sticking out of its head,

00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:54.235
no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:57.490
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
sort of looked alike.

00:09:58.362 --> 00:09:59.961
But they did look at these three

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:02.440
and they said, "These
are three different dinosaurs,

00:10:02.464 --> 00:10:05.378
and Dracorex is probably
the most primitive of them.

00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:09.312
And the other one
is more primitive than the other."

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:13.517
It's unclear to me how they actually
sorted these three of them out.

00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:15.434
But if you line them up,

00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:18.513
if you just take those three skulls
and just line them up,

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:20.524
they line up like this.

00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:22.604
Dracorex is the littlest one,

00:10:22.628 --> 00:10:25.237
Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,

00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.236
Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.236
And one would think,
that should give me a clue.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.589
(Laughter)

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:35.143
But it didn't give them a clue.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.341
(Laughter)

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:39.440
Because, well we know why.

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:42.603
Scientists like to name things.

00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.664
So if we cut open Dracorex --

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.613
I cut open our Dracorex --

00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:52.861
and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:56.584
I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast.

00:10:57.164 --> 00:10:59.151
So it is going to get bigger.

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:02.813
If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing.

00:11:02.837 --> 00:11:06.467
The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast.

00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:08.183
It's inflating very fast.

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:12.200
What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex

00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:14.303
was growing very fast as well.

00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:17.576
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.734
which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger.

00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:24.236
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.511
Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome

00:11:27.535 --> 00:11:32.503
and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing.

00:11:32.527 --> 00:11:36.236
So just with these three dinosaurs,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.956
as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.235
that it is just a growth series
of the same animal.

00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:46.950
Which of course means

00:11:48.222 --> 00:11:52.941
that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.

00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:57.929
(Laughter)

00:11:57.953 --> 00:11:59.290
OK.

00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:00.464
(Laughter)

00:12:02.207 --> 00:12:07.639
Which of course means
we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:13.431
So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
he and I were looking at Triceratops.

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:15.770
And before the year 2000 --

00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:19.466
now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s --

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.655
before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops.

00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:29.166
There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.236
but no one had ever collected a juvenile.

00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:35.080
And we know why, right?

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:37.236
Because everybody wants to have a big one.

00:12:38.104 --> 00:12:40.138
So everyone had a big one.

00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:42.570
So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff

00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:44.601
and we found a whole bunch of little ones.

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.236
They're everywhere,
they're all over the place.

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:50.109
So we have a whole bunch
of them at our museum.

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:54.583
(Laughter)

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.271
And everybody says
it's because I have a little museum.

00:12:57.295 --> 00:13:00.015
When you have a little museum,
you have little dinosaurs.

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:03.041
(Laughter)

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.891
If you look at the Triceratops,

00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:07.147
you can see it's changing,
it's shape-shifting.

00:13:07.584 --> 00:13:11.114
As the juveniles are growing up,
their horns actually curve backwards.

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:15.161
And then as they get older,
the horns grow forward.

00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:16.564
And that's pretty cool.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.903
If you look along the edge of the frill,

00:13:18.927 --> 00:13:24.093
they have these little triangular bones
that actually grow big as triangles

00:13:24.117 --> 00:13:26.821
and then they flatten against the frill

00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:30.419
pretty much like the spikes do
on the Pachycephalosaurs.

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:35.559
And then, because the juveniles
are in my collection,

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.063
I cut them open ...

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:38.238
(Laughter)

00:13:38.262 --> 00:13:39.436
and look inside.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.605
And the little one is really spongy.

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:45.003
And the middle-size one is really spongy.

00:13:45.027 --> 00:13:49.902
But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.944
And this is a skull
that is two meters long.

00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:55.236
It's a big skull.

00:13:56.088 --> 00:14:00.735
But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:04.362
that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger,

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:06.354
and it's called Torosaurus.

00:14:07.215 --> 00:14:11.235
And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone.

00:14:11.697 --> 00:14:13.739
But it's got these big
holes in its shield.

00:14:13.763 --> 00:14:14.916
And everybody says,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.600
"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.116
because one of them's bigger
than the other one."

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.775
(Laughter)

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.272
"And it has holes in its frill."

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:31.255
And I said, "Well do we have
any juvenile Torosauruses?"

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:35.866
And they said, "Well, no,
but it has holes in its frill."

00:14:36.723 --> 00:14:40.175
So one of my graduate
students, John Scannella,

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:41.918
looked through our whole collection

00:14:41.942 --> 00:14:48.058
and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops

00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:51.217
and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --

00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:56.379
so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus,

00:14:56.403 --> 00:14:57.635
which was pretty cool.

00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:03.790
So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops.

00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:07.004
Now when we name dinosaurs,

00:15:07.028 --> 00:15:10.564
when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:14.433
and the second name is thrown out.

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:17.388
So Torosaurus is extinct.

00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:22.519
Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.

00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:26.093
They thought Torosaurus should be kept
and Triceratops thrown out,

00:15:26.117 --> 00:15:27.901
but that's not going to happen.

00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:33.415
(Laughter)

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:36.722
All right, so we can do this
with a bunch of dinosaurs.

00:15:36.746 --> 00:15:38.792
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus

00:15:38.816 --> 00:15:40.236
and Anatotitan.

00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:43.235
Anatotitan: giant duck.

00:15:43.892 --> 00:15:46.043
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.

00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:47.795
Here's another one.

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:50.292
So we look at the bone histology.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:55.199
The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,

00:15:55.223 --> 00:15:56.851
or at least a subadult,

00:15:56.875 --> 00:16:02.628
and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny.

00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:05.486
And we get rid of Anatotitan.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.481
So we can just keep doing this.

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:11.841
And the last one is T. Rex.

00:16:12.592 --> 00:16:17.236
So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.150
(Laughter)

00:16:20.174 --> 00:16:22.890
Again, it makes you wonder.

00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:26.124
(Laughter)

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:28.483
But they had a good question.

00:16:28.507 --> 00:16:31.392
They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth,

00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:33.280
and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:35.174
And that doesn't make any sense at all,

00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:38.866
because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.138
So it must be true --

00:16:41.162 --> 00:16:42.455
they must be different."

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:45.236
So we cut into them.

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:50.510
And sure enough,
Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone

00:16:50.534 --> 00:16:54.126
and the bigger one has more mature bone.

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:57.102
It looks like it could still get bigger.

00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:59.347
And at the Museum
of the Rockies where we work,

00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:03.010
I have four T. rexes,
so I can cut a whole bunch of them.

00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:05.236
But I didn't have to cut
any of them really,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.236
because I just lined up their jaws

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.570
and it turned out
the biggest one had 12 teeth

00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:13.769
and the next smallest one had 13

00:17:13.793 --> 00:17:16.023
and the next smallest had 14.

00:17:16.047 --> 00:17:18.070
And of course, Nano has 17.

00:17:18.094 --> 00:17:20.981
And we just went out and looked
at other people's collections

00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:24.740
and we found one that has
sort of 15 teeth.

00:17:24.764 --> 00:17:27.542
So again, real easy to say

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:32.235
that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
included Nanotyrannus,

00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:37.585
and therefore we can take out
another dinosaur.

00:17:37.609 --> 00:17:39.236
(Laughter)

00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:45.930
So when it comes down
to our end Cretaceous,

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:47.501
we have seven left.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.644
And that's a good number.

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:54.236
That's a good number
to go extinct, I think.

00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:56.098
Now as you can imagine,

00:17:56.122 --> 00:17:58.883
this is not very popular
with fourth-graders.

00:17:59.003 --> 00:18:00.004
(Laughter)

00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:05.004
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,
they memorize them.

00:18:08.373 --> 00:18:10.103
And they're not happy with this.

00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:12.743
(Laughter)

00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:13.958
Thank you very much.

00:18:13.982 --> 00:18:17.886
(Applause)
