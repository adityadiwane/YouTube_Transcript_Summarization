00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm a relationship builder.

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.936
When you think of a relationship builder,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.260
don't you just automatically
think "architect?"

00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:21.165
Probably not.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:26.103
That's because most people think
architects design buildings and cities,

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.481
but what we really design
are relationships,

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.310
because cities are about people.

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:34.716
They're places where people come together
for all kinds of exchange.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.957
And besides, skylines
are highly specific urban habitats

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.299
with their own insects,
plants and animals,

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:41.956
and even their own weather.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.214
But today, urban habitats
are out of balance.

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.655
Climate change, together with political
and economic troubles,

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.831
are having an impact;

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.167
they're adding up
and stressing out cities and us,

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:55.722
the people who live in them.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.445
For me, the field of ecology
has provided important insight,

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.678
because ecologists don't just look
at individual species on their own,

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.895
they look at the relationships
between living things

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.168
and their environment.

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:14.252
They look at how all the diverse parts
of the ecosystem are interconnected,

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:18.574
and it's actually this balance,
this web of life, that sustains life.

00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:23.680
My team and I have been applying
insights from ecology to architecture

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:27.698
to see how physical space
can help build stronger relationships.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.086
The projects I'm going to show you today

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.813
use the idea of building relationships
as the key driver for design.

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:36.505
Here's an example of what I mean.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.678
Recently, we were asked to design
a center for social justice leadership

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.252
called the Arcus Center.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:46.444
They asked us for a building
that could break down traditional barriers

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:47.752
between different groups

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.023
and in doing so, create possibilities
for meaningful conversations

00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:53.551
around social justice.

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.710
The students wanted a place
for cultural exchange.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.533
They thought a place for preparing
food together could do that.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.288
And they wanted to be welcoming
to the outside community.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.975
They thought a fireplace
could draw people in

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.295
and help start conversations.

00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:12.838
And everybody wanted the work
of social justice to be visible

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:14.281
to the outside world.

00:02:15.388 --> 00:02:18.129
There really wasn't a precedent
for this kind of space,

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.620
so we looked around the globe
and found examples

00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:22.389
of community meeting houses.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.984
Community meeting houses are places

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.369
where there's very specific
relationships between people,

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:31.565
like this one in Mali,
where the elders gather.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.561
The low roof keeps everybody seated
and at equal eye level.

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:36.808
It's very egalitarian.

00:02:36.832 --> 00:02:39.310
I mean, you can't stand up
and take over the meeting.

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:40.847
You'd actually bump your head.

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.524
(Laughter)

00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:45.162
In meeting houses,
there's always a central space

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.837
where you can sit around a circle
and see each other.

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:49.882
So we designed a space just like that

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:51.885
right in the middle of the Arcus Center,

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.899
and we anchored it
with a fireplace and a kitchen.

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:58.395
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen
and a fireplace in a building like this

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.623
with the building codes,

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:02.449
but it was so important
to the concept, we got it done.

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:06.889
And now the central space
works for big social gatherings

00:03:06.913 --> 00:03:10.151
and a place to meet one-on-one
for the very first time.

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.254
It's almost like
this three-way intersection

00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:15.852
that encourages bumping into people
and starting a conversation.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.640
Now you can always pass the kitchen
and see something going on.

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:23.011
You can sit by the fireplace
and share stories.

00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:26.771
You can study together
in big groups or in small ones,

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:30.032
because the architecture
sets up these opportunities.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.064
Even the construction
is about building relationships.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.949
It's made of cordwood masonry,

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:38.910
which is using logs
the way you would use bricks.

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.905
It's super low-tech and easy to do
and anyone can do it --

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.606
and that's the entire point.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.597
The act of making is a social activity.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.240
And it's good for the planet, too:

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:53.360
the trees absorbed carbon
when they were growing up,

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.028
and they gave off oxygen,

00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:57.793
and now that carbon
is trapped inside the walls

00:03:57.817 --> 00:04:00.990
and it's not being released
into the atmosphere.

00:04:01.014 --> 00:04:05.085
So making the walls is equivalent
to taking cars right off the road.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.238
We chose the building method

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:12.208
because it connects people
to each other and to the environment.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.406
But is it working?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.696
Is it creating relationships
and nurturing them?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.038
How can we know?

00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:21.473
Well, more and more people
are coming here, for one,

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:23.817
and as a result of the fireside chats

00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:25.939
and a full calendar of programming,

00:04:25.963 --> 00:04:28.551
people are applying
for the Arcus Fellowships.

00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:32.874
In fact, applications have increased
tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.163
since the building opened.

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:36.857
It's working. It's bringing
people together.

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:40.442
So I've shown how architecture
can connect people

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.624
on this kind of horizontal campus scale.

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:46.663
But we wondered if social relationships
could be scaled up --

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:49.340
or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:54.238
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend
themselves to being social buildings.

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:56.255
They can seem isolating and inward.

00:04:56.646 --> 00:05:01.178
You might only see people
in those awkward elevator rides.

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:06.007
But in several major cities,
I've been designing tall buildings

00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:09.372
that are based on creating
relationships between people.

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.872
This is Aqua.

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:14.470
It's a residential high-rise in Chicago

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.105
aimed at young urban professionals
and empty nesters,

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.772
many of them new to the city.

00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:23.563
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see
if we could use architecture

00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:25.658
to help people get to know
their neighbors,

00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:28.932
even when their homes are organized
in the vertical dimension.

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:34.624
So we invented a way to use balconies
as the new social connectors.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.929
The shapes of the floor slabs
vary slightly and they transition

00:05:38.953 --> 00:05:40.322
as you go up the tower.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:44.247
The result of this
is that you can actually see people

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:45.616
from your balcony.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.773
The balconies are misregistered.

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.941
You can lean over your balcony
and say, "Hey!"

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:52.166
just like you would across the backyard.

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.846
To make the balconies more comfortable

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.147
for a longer period of time
during the year,

00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:59.637
we studied the wind
with digital simulations,

00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.523
so the effect of the balcony shapes
breaks up the wind

00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:03.858
and confuses the wind

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.939
and makes the balconies
more comfortable and less windy.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.879
Now, just by being able
to go outside on your balcony

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.978
or on the third floor roof terrace,

00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:15.087
you can be connected to the outdoors,

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.242
even when you're way above
the ground plane.

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:20.001
So the building acts to create community

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.646
within the building and the city
at the same time.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.836
It's working.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:28.683
And people are starting to meet each other
on the building surface

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:29.863
and we've heard --

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:30.943
(Laughter)

00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:33.735
they've even starting getting
together as couples.

00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:37.203
But besides romantic relationships,

00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:39.467
the building has a positive social effect

00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:41.428
on the community,

00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:44.139
as evidenced by people
starting groups together

00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:46.009
and starting big projects together,

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:50.009
like this organic community garden
on the building's roof terrace.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:54.710
So I've shown how tall buildings
can be social connectors,

00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:56.726
but what about public architecture?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.613
How can we create better
social cohesion in public buildings

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:01.994
and civic spaces,

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:03.451
and why is it important?

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.987
Public architecture
is just not as successful

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.935
if it comes from the top down.

00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:11.411
About 15 years ago in Chicago,

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:14.542
they started to replace
old police stations,

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.736
and they built this identical model
all over the city.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.880
And even though they had good intentions

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:23.402
of treating all neighborhoods equally,

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.846
the communities didn't feel
invested in the process

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.384
or feel a sense of ownership
of these buildings.

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:31.935
It was equality in the sense that
everybody gets the same police station,

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:35.313
but it wasn't equity
in the sense of responding

00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:37.695
to each community's individual needs.

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.560
And equity is the key issue here.

00:07:40.584 --> 00:07:43.984
You know, in my field, there's a debate

00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:46.599
about whether architecture
can even do anything

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:48.808
to improve social relationships.

00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:54.266
But I believe that we need architecture
and every tool in our tool kit

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.228
to improve these relationships.

00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:00.516
In the US, policy reforms
have been recommended

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.344
in order to rebuild trust.

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:03.776
But my team and I wondered

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.839
if design and a more inclusive
design process

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:10.516
could help add something positive
to this policy conversation.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.226
We asked ourselves simply:

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.206
Can design help rebuild trust?

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:19.250
So we reached out to community members
and police officers in North Lawndale;

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:20.833
it's a neighborhood in Chicago

00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:23.673
where the police station
is perceived as a scary fortress

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:25.386
surrounded by a parking lot.

00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:28.692
In North Lawndale,
people are afraid of police

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:30.921
and of going anywhere
near the police station,

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.232
even to report a crime.

00:08:32.663 --> 00:08:35.416
So we organized this brainstorming session

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.098
with both groups participating,

00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:40.302
and we came up with this whole
new idea for the police station.

00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.866
It's called "Polis Station."

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.610
"Polis" is a Greek word that means
a place with a sense of community.

00:08:48.348 --> 00:08:49.968
It's based on the idea

00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:53.929
that if you can increase opportunities
for positive social interactions

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:56.246
between police and community members,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.465
you can rebuild that relationship

00:08:58.489 --> 00:09:01.203
and activate the neighborhood
at the same time.

00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:05.108
Instead of the police station
as a scary fortress,

00:09:05.132 --> 00:09:09.589
you get highly active spaces
on the public side of the station --

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:11.123
places that spark conversation,

00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:13.707
like a barbershop, a coffee shop

00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:15.304
or sports courts as well.

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:17.507
Both cops and kids said they love sports.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.550
These insights came directly
from the community members

00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:23.906
and the police officers themselves,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.689
and as designers, our role
was just to connect the dots

00:09:27.713 --> 00:09:29.335
and suggest the first step.

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.287
So with the help
of the city and the parks,

00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.597
we were able to raise funds
and design and build a half-court,

00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:38.961
right on the police station parking lot.

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.426
It's a start.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.318
But is it rebuilding trust?

00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:46.250
The people in North Lawndale say
the kids are using the courts every day

00:09:46.274 --> 00:09:49.623
and they even organize tournaments
like this one shown here,

00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:52.261
and once in a while an officer joins in.

00:09:54.084 --> 00:09:56.750
But now, they even have basketballs
inside the station

00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:58.039
that kids can borrow.

00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:00.555
And recently they've asked us
to expand the courts

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.522
and build a park on the site.

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.827
And parents report something astonishing.

00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:11.542
Before, there was fear of going
anywhere the station, and now they say

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:15.053
there's a sense that the court is safer
than other courts nearby,

00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:17.351
and they prefer their kids to play here.

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:19.687
So maybe in the future,

00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:21.357
on the public side of the station,

00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:25.086
you might be able to drop in
for a haircut at the barbershop

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.759
or reserve the community room
for a birthday party

00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:29.426
or renew your driver's license

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.548
or get money out of an ATM.

00:10:32.024 --> 00:10:34.715
It can be a place for neighbors
to meet each other

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.426
and to get to know
the officers, and vice versa.

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.545
This is not a utopian fantasy.

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:44.557
It's about how do you design
to rebuild trust,

00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:46.068
trusting relationships?

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:50.620
You know, every city has parks,
libraries, schools

00:10:50.644 --> 00:10:52.038
and other public buildings

00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:56.248
that have the potential
to be reimagined as social connectors.

00:10:56.954 --> 00:11:00.984
But reimagining the buildings
for the future is going to require

00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.116
engaging the people who live there.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:07.687
Engaging the public can be intimidating,
and I've felt that, too.

00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:09.992
But maybe that's because
in architecture school,

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:14.023
we don't really learn how to engage
the public in the act of design.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:17.157
We're taught to defend
our design against criticism.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.662
But I think that can change, too.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.386
So if we can focus the design mind

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.390
on creating positive,
reinforcing relationships

00:11:27.414 --> 00:11:29.394
in architecture and through architecture,

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:33.284
I believe we can do much more
than create individual buildings.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:37.260
We can reduce the stress
and the polarization

00:11:37.284 --> 00:11:38.848
in our urban habitats.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.965
We can create relationships.

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:44.788
We can help steady
this planet we all share.

00:11:45.962 --> 00:11:47.121
See?

00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:49.384
Architects really are
relationship builders.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.770
(Laughter)

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.946
Thank you very much.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.015
(Applause)
