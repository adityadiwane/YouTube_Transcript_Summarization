00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.774
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.995
for why investing in early childhood education

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.694
makes sense as a public investment.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.932
It's a different idea, because usually,

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:28.305
when people talk about early childhood programs,

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.646
they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:34.928
in terms of former participants, in preschool,

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:37.193
they have better K-12 test scores,

00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:39.308
better adult earnings.

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:41.423
Now that's all very important,

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:45.519
but what I want to talk about is what preschool does

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.341
for state economies

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.638
and for promoting state economic development.

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:53.931
And that's actually crucial

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.255
because if we're going to get increased investment

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.598
in early childhood programs,

00:00:59.598 --> 00:01:03.121
we need to interest state governments in this.

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.347
The federal government has a lot on its plate,

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:07.845
and state governments are going to have to step up.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:10.028
So we have to appeal to them,

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.581
the legislators in the state government,

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:14.571
and turn to something they understand,

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:16.869
that they have to promote the economic development

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.556
of their state economy.

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:20.372
Now, by promoting economic development,

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.086
I don't mean anything magical.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:25.549
All I mean is, is that early childhood education

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.452
can bring more and better jobs to a state

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:32.630
and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.580
for the state's residents.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.573
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:40.577
state and local economic development,

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:44.359
they don't generally think first about what they're doing

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.914
about childcare and early childhood programs.

00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:50.817
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.

00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:52.440
I've talked to a lot of directors

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.768
of state economic development agencies about these issues,

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:57.310
a lot of legislators about these issues.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.369
When legislators and others think about economic development,

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.625
what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:06.503
property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,

00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:09.190
you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.796
So for example, states compete very vigorously

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:15.461
to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:17.601
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.799
Now, those programs can make sense

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.801
if they in fact induce new location decisions,

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:24.186
and the way they can make sense is,

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.499
by creating more and better jobs,

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.082
they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.152
So there is a benefit to state residents

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.301
that corresponds to the costs that they're paying

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.574
by paying for these business tax breaks.

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:40.382
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:44.107
can do exactly the same thing,

00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:48.016
create more and better jobs, but in a different way.

00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:50.434
It's a somewhat more indirect way.

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:54.080
These programs can promote more and better jobs by,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.955
you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,

00:02:56.955 --> 00:03:00.773
it develops the skills of your local workforce

00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:04.516
if enough of them stick around, and, in turn,

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.669
that higher-quality local workforce

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.361
will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:13.869
higher earnings per capita in the local community.

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.833
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:21.416
Okay. If you look at the research evidence --

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:26.079
that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.676
affect the educational attainment, wages and skills

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:34.185
of former participants in preschool as adults,

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:36.821
you take those known effects,

00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:39.509
you take how many of those folks will be expected

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.210
to stick around the state or local economy and not move out,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.030
and you take research on how much skills

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.201
drive job creation, you will conclude,

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.244
from these three separate lines of research,

00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:56.323
that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,

00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:59.776
the per capita earnings of state residents

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:02.542
go up by two dollars and 78 cents,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.409
so that's a three-to-one return.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.442
Now you can get much higher returns,

00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:11.516
of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:16.230
if you include benefits to former preschool participants

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.414
who move to some other state,

00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:21.425
but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:23.512
because this is salient and important

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.802
to state legislators and state policy makers,

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.946
and it's the states that are going to have to act.

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:31.245
So there is this key benefit that is relevant

00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:34.494
to state policy makers in terms of economic development.

00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:37.912
Now, one objection you often hear,

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:42.809
or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:47.272
why should I pay more taxes

00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:51.550
to invest in other people's children?

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.044
What's in it for me?

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.323
And the trouble with that objection,

00:04:56.323 --> 00:05:00.325
it reflects a total misunderstanding

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:03.342
of how much local economies

00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:06.848
involve everyone being interdependent.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.765
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:14.298
there are huge spillovers of skills --

00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:19.618
that when other people's children get more skills,

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:23.387
that actually increases the prosperity of everyone,

00:05:23.387 --> 00:05:26.741
including people whose skills don't change.

00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.145
So for example, numerous research studies have shown

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.724
if you look at what really drives

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:34.188
the growth rate of metropolitan areas,

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:39.858
it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;

00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:43.481
it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:47.016
that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.

00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:50.095
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:53.608
such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,

00:05:53.608 --> 00:05:58.944
Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically

00:05:58.944 --> 00:06:01.253
because they're low-cost.

00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:03.178
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.

00:06:03.178 --> 00:06:05.995
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:11.940
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.095
So when we invest in other people's children,

00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:19.280
and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.801
of a metro area.

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:24.689
As another example, if we look

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.924
at what determines an individual's wages,

00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:32.149
and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.672
we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,

00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:39.103
on that individual's education,

00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:42.096
for example whether or not they have a college degree.

00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:45.434
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,

00:06:45.434 --> 00:06:49.481
we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,

00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:52.385
the effect of your own education,

00:06:52.385 --> 00:06:55.585
the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area

00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:57.557
also affects your wages.

00:06:57.557 --> 00:07:01.761
So specifically, if you hold constant your education,

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.864
you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,

00:07:05.864 --> 00:07:09.824
you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:13.294
without changing your education at all.

00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:16.445
In fact, this effect is so strong

00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:20.258
that when someone gets a college degree,

00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:22.699
the spillover effects of this on the wages

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.592
of others in the metropolitan area

00:07:24.592 --> 00:07:27.694
are actually greater than the direct effects.

00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:31.147
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:34.462
go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.

00:07:34.462 --> 00:07:36.977
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:40.840
of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.256
and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person,

00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:47.688
but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:51.314
you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:54.227
in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.

00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:56.305
That's actually greater than the direct benefits

00:07:56.305 --> 00:07:59.359
of the person choosing to get education.

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:00.718
Now, what's going on here?

00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:04.641
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.115
Well, let's think about it this way.

00:08:06.115 --> 00:08:09.438
I can be the most skilled person in the world,

00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:13.239
but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.208
my employer is going to find it more difficult

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:20.264
to introduce new technology, new production techniques.

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:23.866
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.

00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:27.467
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:31.148
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,

00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:34.656
if the workers at the suppliers to my firm

00:08:34.656 --> 00:08:36.626
do not have good skills,

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:39.023
my firm is going to be less competitive

00:08:39.023 --> 00:08:41.408
competing in national and international markets.

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:44.502
And again, the firm that's less competitive

00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:47.191
will not be able to pay as good wages,

00:08:47.191 --> 00:08:51.324
and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,

00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:54.585
they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:57.805
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley

00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:01.600
has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.019
but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:09.553
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children

00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:11.955
through preschool and other early childhood programs

00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:15.611
that are high-quality, we not only help those children,

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:19.232
we help everyone in the metropolitan area

00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:22.903
gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area

00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:24.925
gain in job growth.

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:27.456
Another objection used sometimes here

00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:29.684
to invest in early childhood programs

00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:33.405
is concern about people moving out.

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:37.640
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.884
in more preschool education

00:09:39.884 --> 00:09:43.694
for children in Columbus, Ohio,

00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:45.953
but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,

00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:48.870
for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.387
and become Wolverines.

00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:53.681
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing

00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:56.122
in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:59.357
these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.

00:09:59.357 --> 00:10:03.349
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.

00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:06.290
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.503
Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.

00:10:10.503 --> 00:10:15.623
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans

00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:18.061
spend most of their working careers

00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:21.831
in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.

00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:25.926
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:29.030
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.828
whether it's depressed or booming,

00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:33.149
it doesn't vary much over time.

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:38.962
So the reality is, if you invest in kids,

00:10:38.962 --> 00:10:41.461
they will stay.

00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:44.499
Or at least, enough of them will stay

00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:47.920
that it will pay off for your state economy.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.844
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence

00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:54.998
that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,

00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:57.854
pay off in higher adult skills.

00:10:57.854 --> 00:10:59.421
There's a lot of research evidence

00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:03.045
that those folks will stick around the state economy,

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:06.362
and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers

00:11:06.362 --> 00:11:08.452
with higher skills in your local economy

00:11:08.452 --> 00:11:12.131
pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,

00:11:12.131 --> 00:11:15.574
and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:18.303
we get about three dollars back

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.478
in benefits for the state economy.

00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:24.090
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.914
and the logic of this is compelling.

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:30.604
So what are the barriers to getting it done?

00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:33.868
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.

00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:38.198
So if you look at what it would cost

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:41.025
if every state government invested

00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:45.230
in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.645
the total annual national cost would be roughly

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:50.950
30 billion dollars.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.375
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:57.120
On the other hand, if you reflect on

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.980
that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.663
we're talking about an amount of money

00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:06.283
that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.

00:12:06.283 --> 00:12:09.261
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:13.266
is something that any state government can afford to do.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:18.015
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.

00:12:18.015 --> 00:12:19.895
And, of course, as I mentioned,

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:22.049
this cost has corresponding benefits.

00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:24.225
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,

00:12:24.225 --> 00:12:26.325
2.78, for the state economy,

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:29.354
in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.

00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:32.378
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars

00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:34.271
to something that might mean something,

00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:37.859
what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:40.976
that would increase earnings by about 10 percent

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:44.175
over their whole career, just doing the preschool,

00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:46.690
not improving K-12 or anything else after that,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.238
not doing anything with college tuition or access,

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:51.934
just directly improving preschool,

00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:54.233
and we would get five percent higher earnings

00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.629
for middle-class kids.

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:57.694
So this is an investment

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.602
that pays off in very concrete terms

00:13:00.602 --> 00:13:05.022
for a broad range of income groups in the state's population

00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:09.532
and produces large and tangible benefits.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:12.086
Now, that's one barrier.

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:15.508
I actually think the more profound barrier

00:13:15.508 --> 00:13:19.938
is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.

00:13:19.938 --> 00:13:22.784
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing

00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:24.539
the quality of our local workforce,

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:27.205
and thereby increasing economic development.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:30.585
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,

00:13:30.585 --> 00:13:32.953
we're not sending these kids out at age five

00:13:32.953 --> 00:13:36.468
to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.

00:13:36.468 --> 00:13:39.880
So we're talking about an investment

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.350
that in terms of impacts on the state economy

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.311
is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,

00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:49.169
and of course America is notorious for being

00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:52.176
a short term-oriented society.

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:53.836
Now one response you can make to this,

00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.361
and I sometimes have done this in talks,

00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:58.438
is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:02.085
in reducing special ed and remedial education costs,

00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:04.391
there are benefits, parents care about preschool,

00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.641
maybe we'll get some migration effects

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:08.959
from parents seeking good preschool,

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.606
and I think those are true,

00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:12.768
but in some sense they're missing the point.

00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:15.339
Ultimately, this is something

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:19.264
we're investing in now for the future.

00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:23.213
And so what I want to leave you with is

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:25.519
what I think is the ultimate question.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:28.353
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately

00:14:28.353 --> 00:14:33.898
not an economic question, it's a moral question:

00:14:33.898 --> 00:14:38.105
Are we willing, as Americans,

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:41.555
are we as a society still capable

00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:46.339
of making the political choice to sacrifice now

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:48.988
by paying more taxes

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:54.193
in order to improve the long-term future

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:57.610
of not only our kids, but our community?

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.057
Are we still capable of that as a country?

00:15:02.057 --> 00:15:04.498
And that's something that each and every citizen

00:15:04.498 --> 00:15:07.041
and voter needs to ask themselves.

00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:09.986
Is that something that you are still invested in,

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:12.720
that you still believe in the notion of investment?

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.119
That is the notion of investment.

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:16.693
You sacrifice now for a return later.

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:20.331
So I think the research evidence

00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:22.969
on the benefits of early childhood programs

00:15:22.969 --> 00:15:26.576
for the local economy is extremely strong.

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:30.858
However, the moral and political choice

00:15:30.858 --> 00:15:35.962
is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.

00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:39.985
Thank you very much. (Applause)
