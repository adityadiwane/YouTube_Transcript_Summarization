00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.451
Today, I am going to talk about anger.

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:23.130
When I was 11,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.462
seeing some of my friends 
leaving the school

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:30.684
because their parents 
could not afford textbooks

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:33.186
made me angry.

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:38.068
When I was 27,

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:43.280
hearing the plight
of a desperate slave father

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.292
whose daughter was 
about to be sold to a brothel

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:50.683
made me angry.

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:54.763
At the age of 50,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:59.586
lying on the street,
in a pool of blood,

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:02.532
along with my own son,

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:04.999
made me angry.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.484
Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.486
Our parents, teachers, priests --

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:21.371
everyone taught us how to control 
and suppress our anger.

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.146
But I ask why?

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:32.513
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?

00:01:32.513 --> 00:01:34.109
Why can't we use our anger

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.615
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.176
That I tried to do.

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:47.847
Friends,

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:55.370
most of the brightest ideas
came to my mind out of anger.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:02:05.514
Like when I was 35 and sat 
in a locked-up, tiny prison.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:09.067
The whole night, I was angry.

00:02:09.957 --> 00:02:13.017
But it has given birth to a new idea.

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:16.176
But I will come to that later on.

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:23.041
Let me begin with the story
of how I got a name for myself.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:29.622
I had been a big admirer 
of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:36.321
Gandhi fought and lead 
India's freedom movement.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.299
But more importantly,

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.034
he taught us how to treat 
the most vulnerable sections,

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:50.305
the most deprived people, 
with dignity and respect.

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:56.562
And so, when India was celebrating

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:59.829
Mahatma Gandhi's 
birth centenary in 1969 --

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.117
at that time I was 15 --

00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:04.474
an idea came to my mind.

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:09.244
Why can't we celebrate it differently?

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:14.672
I knew, as perhaps
many of you might know,

00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:22.665
that in India, a large number of people
are born in the lowest segment of caste.

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.324
And they are treated as untouchables.

00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:28.656
These are the people --

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:33.066
forget about allowing them 
to go to the temples,

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:40.250
they cannot even go into the houses 
and shops of high-caste people.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.564
So I was very impressed with 
the leaders of my town

00:03:45.564 --> 00:03:50.102
who were speaking very highly against
the caste system and untouchability

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:52.274
and talking of Gandhian ideals.

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:56.944
So inspired by that, I thought,
let us set an example

00:03:56.944 --> 00:04:03.389
by inviting these people to eat food
cooked and served

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.619
by the untouchable community.

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:11.551
I went to some low-caste,
so-called untouchable, people,

00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.807
tried to convince them,
but it was unthinkable for them.

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:21.760
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.
It never happened."

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.784
I said, "Look at these leaders,

00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:27.221
they are so great, 
they are against untouchability.

00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:29.911
They will come. If nobody comes, 
we can set an example."

00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:38.751
These people thought that I was too naive.

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:42.651
Finally, they were convinced.

00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:48.352
My friends and I took our bicycles
and invited political leaders.

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:53.126
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:57.722
to see that each one of them 
agreed to come.

00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:02.083
I thought, "Great idea.
We can set an example.

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:05.711
We can bring about change in the society."

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.004
The day has come.

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:15.467
All these untouchables,
three women and two men,

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.816
they agreed to come.

00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:25.075
I could recall that they had used 
the best of their clothes.

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:28.740
They brought new utensils.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.339
They had taken baths 
hundreds of times

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.300
because it was unthinkable
for them to do.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.944
It was the moment of change.

00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:41.702
They gathered. Food was cooked.

00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:45.000
It was 7 o'clock.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.876
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:52.857
because it's not very uncommon 
that the leaders become late,

00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:54.539
for an hour or so.

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:01.922
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
and went to these leaders' homes,

00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:04.278
just to remind them.

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:10.945
One of the leader's wives told me,

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:15.960
"Sorry, he is having some headache,
perhaps he cannot come."

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.037
I went to another leader

00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:22.097
and his wife told me, 
"Okay, you go, he will definitely join."

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:27.469
So I thought that the dinner
will take place,

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.952
though not at that large a scale.

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:39.319
I went back to the venue, which was
a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.053
It was 10 o'clock.

00:06:43.483 --> 00:06:46.822
None of the leaders showed up.

00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:50.835
That made me angry.

00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:58.679
I was standing, leaning against
Mahatma Gandhi's statue.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:06.310
I was emotionally drained,
rather exhausted.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.375
Then I sat down where 
the food was lying.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:19.785
I kept my emotions on hold.

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:24.279
But then, when I took the first bite,

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.210
I broke down in tears.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.149
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:38.047
And it was the healing, motherly touch 
of an untouchable woman.

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:42.278
And she told me,
"Kailash, why are you crying?

00:07:43.598 --> 00:07:46.011
You have done your bit.

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:49.136
You have eaten the food
cooked by untouchables,

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:52.127
which has never happened in our memory."

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:57.789
She said, "You won today."

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:02.759
And my friends, she was right.

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:07.789
I came back home, a little after midnight,

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:12.363
shocked to see that several 
high-caste elderly people

00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:14.517
were sitting in my courtyard.

00:08:14.517 --> 00:08:17.613
I saw my mother and 
elderly women were crying

00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:22.071
and they were pleading 
to these elderly people

00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.005
because they had threatened 
to outcaste my whole family.

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:31.477
And you know, outcasting the family
is the biggest social punishment

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:34.031
one can think of.

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:40.821
Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
and the punishment was purification.

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:45.336
That means I had to go 600 miles
away from my hometown

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:49.267
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:53.691
And after that, I should organize a feast
for priests, 101 priests,

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:57.239
wash their feet and drink that water.

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:01.528
It was total nonsense,

00:09:01.528 --> 00:09:04.417
and I refused to accept that punishment.

00:09:05.267 --> 00:09:07.397
How did they punish me?

00:09:07.397 --> 00:09:13.194
I was barred from entering into my own 
kitchen and my own dining room,

00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:16.246
my utensils were separated.

00:09:16.246 --> 00:09:21.300
But the night when I was angry,
they wanted to outcaste me.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.633
But I decided to outcaste 
the entire caste system.

00:09:27.503 --> 00:09:32.228
(Applause)

00:09:32.988 --> 00:09:38.003
And that was possible because
the beginning would have been

00:09:38.003 --> 00:09:40.119
to change the family name, or surname,

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:43.784
because in India, most of
the family names are caste names.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:46.306
So I decided to drop my name.

00:09:46.306 --> 00:09:52.810
And then, later on, I gave 
a new name to myself: Satyarthi,

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.776
that means, "seeker of truth."

00:09:57.216 --> 00:10:01.248
(Applause)

00:10:01.248 --> 00:10:04.585
And that was the beginning 
of my transformative anger.

00:10:06.095 --> 00:10:08.704
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,

00:10:08.704 --> 00:10:13.530
what was I doing before becoming
a children's rights activist?

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.788
Does anybody know?

00:10:16.898 --> 00:10:18.169
No.

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:24.558
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:29.662
And then I learned how the energy

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:34.146
of burning fire, coal,

00:10:34.146 --> 00:10:38.250
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.442
raging river currents,

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:45.066
fierce winds,

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:50.083
could be converted into the light 
and lives of millions.

00:10:50.963 --> 00:10:55.495
I also learned how the most
uncontrollable form of energy

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:59.970
could be harnessed for good 
and making society better.

00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:11.692
So I'll come back to the story
of when I was caught in the prison:

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:15.919
I was very happy freeing 
a dozen children from slavery,

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.890
handing them over to their parents.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.078
I cannot explain my joy 
when I free a child.

00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:24.428
I was so happy.

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:31.021
But when I was waiting for my train
to come back to my hometown, Delhi,

00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:34.264
I saw that dozens of children 
were arriving;

00:11:34.264 --> 00:11:37.562
they were being trafficked by someone.

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:40.415
I stopped them, those people.

00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:42.517
I complained to the police.

00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:47.071
So the policemen, instead of helping me,

00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:52.773
they threw me in this small, 
tiny shell, like an animal.

00:11:53.573 --> 00:11:55.121
And that was the night of anger

00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:58.972
when one of the brightest 
and biggest ideas was born.

00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:05.100
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 
children, and 50 more will join,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.560
that's not done.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.368
And I believed in the power of consumers,

00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:12.852
and let me tell you that this
was the first time

00:12:12.852 --> 00:12:17.968
when a campaign was launched by me
or anywhere in the world,

00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:22.041
to educate and sensitize the consumers

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:26.501
to create a demand
for child-labor-free rugs.

00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:31.083
In Europe and America, 
we have been successful.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:35.768
And it has resulted 
in a fall in child labor

00:12:35.768 --> 00:12:39.024
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:42.406
(Applause)

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:51.397
Not only that, but this first-ever 
consumer's power, or consumer's campaign

00:12:51.397 --> 00:12:55.505
has grown in other countries
and other industries,

00:12:55.505 --> 00:13:00.931
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, 
maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.

00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:04.823
My anger at the age of 11,

00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:10.176
when I realized how important
education is for every child,

00:13:10.176 --> 00:13:17.821
I got an idea to collect used books
and help the poorest children.

00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:21.270
I created a book bank at the age of 11.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.813
But I did not stop.

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:26.046
Later on, I cofounded

00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:30.580
the world's single largest civil society
campaign for education

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.571
that is the Global Campaign for Education.

00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:38.866
That has helped in changing 
the whole thinking towards education

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:41.257
from the charity mode
to the human rights mode,

00:13:41.257 --> 00:13:46.026
and that has concretely helped 
the reduction of out-of-school children

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:49.614
by half in the last 15 years.

00:13:49.614 --> 00:13:53.693
(Applause)

00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:58.867
My anger at the age of 27,

00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:04.235
to free that girl who was about
to be sold to a brothel,

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:09.018
has given me an idea

00:14:09.018 --> 00:14:13.271
to go for a new strategy
of raid and rescue,

00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:16.188
freeing children from slavery.

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:22.614
And I am so lucky and proud to say
that it is not one or 10 or 20,

00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:28.957
but my colleagues and I have been able
to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves

00:14:28.962 --> 00:14:32.093
and hand them over
back to their families and mothers.

00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:35.452
(Applause)

00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:39.979
I knew that we needed global policies.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:43.011
We organized the worldwide marches
against child labor

00:14:43.011 --> 00:14:49.073
and that has also resulted in 
a new international convention

00:14:49.073 --> 00:14:53.172
to protect the children
who are in the worst forms.

00:14:54.262 --> 00:14:58.351
And the concrete result was that
the number of child laborers globally

00:14:58.351 --> 00:15:03.891
has gone down by one third 
in the last 15 years.

00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:08.311
(Applause)

00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:11.721
So, in each case,

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:15.510
it began from anger,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.159
turned into an idea,

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:21.565
and action.

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:24.441
So anger, what next?

00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:26.920
Idea, and --

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.278
Audience: Action

00:15:28.278 --> 00:15:32.835
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
Which I tried to do.

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:36.751
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,

00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:39.552
and the law of nature is that energy

00:15:39.552 --> 00:15:44.795
can never be created and never 
be vanished, can never be destroyed.

00:15:44.795 --> 00:15:51.685
So why can't the energy of anger
be translated and harnessed

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:56.221
to create a better and beautiful world,
a more just and equitable world?

00:15:56.861 --> 00:15:59.341
Anger is within each one of you,

00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:05.241
and I will share a secret
for a few seconds:

00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:12.795
that if we are confined in 
the narrow shells of egos,

00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:17.225
and the circles of selfishness,

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:24.709
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:28.595
But if we are able to break the circles,

00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:34.481
then the same anger could turn 
into a great power.

00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:38.828
We can break the circles 
by using our inherent compassion

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:42.678
and connect with the world through 
compassion to make this world better.

00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:46.351
That same anger could be
transformed into it.

00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:50.936
So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
again, as a Nobel Laureate,

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:54.711
I am urging you to become angry.

00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:58.983
I am urging you to become angry.

00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:04.299
And the angriest among us

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:11.510
is the one who can transform his anger 
into idea and action.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.275
Thank you so much.

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:18.245
(Applause)

00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:30.924
Chris Anderson: For many years, 
you've been an inspiration to others.

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:34.109
Who or what inspires you and why?

00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:36.341
KS: Good question.

00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:40.335
Chris, let me tell you, 
and that is the truth,

00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:44.849
each time when I free a child,

00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:49.028
the child who has lost all his hope
that he will ever come back to his mother,

00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:53.335
the first smile of freedom,

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:55.890
and the mother who has lost all hope

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:02.501
that the son or daughter 
can ever come back and sit in her lap,

00:18:02.501 --> 00:18:04.656
they become so emotional

00:18:04.656 --> 00:18:09.809
and the first tear of joy 
rolls down on her cheek,

00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:13.154
I see the glimpse of God in it --
this is my biggest inspiration.

00:18:13.154 --> 00:18:18.032
And I am so lucky that not once,
as I said before, but thousands of times,

00:18:18.032 --> 00:18:21.628
I have been able to witness my God
in the faces of those children

00:18:21.628 --> 00:18:23.640
and they are my biggest inspirations.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.652
Thank you.

00:18:25.652 --> 00:18:27.665
(Applause)
