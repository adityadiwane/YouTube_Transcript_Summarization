00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:15.384
Last year, I got a chance to watch
the new "Star Wars" movie,

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:16.563
which was fantastic,

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:18.024
but one thing kept bugging me.

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:19.980
I don't know if you noticed this or not.

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.084
In this entirely technically
advanced world,

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:24.270
I did not see a single AED anywhere,

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:25.702
which was totally shocking --

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.047
almost as shocking
as not knowing what an AED is,

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:29.464
which you guys do know.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:30.639
But for those at home,

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.685
an AED is an automated
external defibrillator.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:36.767
It's the device you use
when your heart goes into cardiac arrest

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.771
to shock it back into a normal rhythm,

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:42.274
or, as one of the guys I was teaching
a class to referred to it as:

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:43.848
"The shocky-hearty-box thing."

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:45.529
(Laughter)

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.064
But I really can't blame the Empire,

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:49.756
since health and safety regulations

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.926
aren't really their first
order of business.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.064
Though, even if we --

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:57.927
I think worse than not having an AED
would be if there was one there,

00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:59.999
but just, no one knew where to find it.

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:03.813
These devices can drastically increase
your chance of survival --

00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:06.447
almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.493
(Laughter)

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:10.695
But I'm pretty sure
that stormtrooper is going to be toast,

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.904
regardless if we have an AED or not,

00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:16.645
since what happens is the chest plate
is going to be quite hard to get off,

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:18.659
and like that tauntaun,

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:22.095
the AED has a very short window of time
at which it's highly effective.

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.507
In this case -- basically, we've got
to use it within the first 10 minutes.

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.633
The Jedi, on the other hand,
have no problems with their outfits.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.389
Those robes open straight up,

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:33.923
you can place the pads
right onto the chest --

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:35.825
so upper-right-hand side of the chest,

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.008
lower left,

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:40.180
wait for the unit to determine
if it's a shockable rhythm

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.722
and get ready to shock.

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:43.271
But, the Jedi do have a problem.

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:44.937
They have a head appendage issue.

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.156
And so I can be totally clear,
thinking I'm ready to go,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.430
but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:52.365
and inadvertently shocking myself.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:53.809
(Laughter)

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:58.371
So before you hit that button,
make sure you are clear

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.266
and everyone else is clear.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.767
Going back to that stormtrooper:

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.189
If I did get that chest plate off in time,

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:09.043
what would you do if you suddenly found
there was a Wookiee under there,

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.575
or possibly two Ewoks?

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.950
(Laughter)

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:14.247
Well, lucky for us,

00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:16.471
in the kit there's actually a razor,

00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:20.050
and we can use that to shave the chest
on the upper right-hand side

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:21.603
and the lower left.

00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:24.317
Wookiees also have another problem.

00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:25.769
They have an accessory issue.

00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:28.349
What we want to do is remove these --

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:31.788
anything between the two pads
we want to remove,

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.999
since it can cause
something called "arcing."

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:35.973
For those who don't know what arcing is,

00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:37.410
do you remember the Emperor,

00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:40.170
when he shoots electricity
out the ends of his fingers --

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:41.207
(Laughter)

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.862
that would be kind of like arcing.

00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:44.037
Another thing that --

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.390
Oh! By the way, he creates that
by wearing wool socks under his robes.

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:48.422
(Laughter)

00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:51.563
We can also get arcing if we have
an extremely wet chest.

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:55.030
The electricity travels across the surface
instead of through the heart.

00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:57.953
We can correct this with the immortal
words of Douglas Adams:

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.747
"Don't panic," which most of us
have done today --

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:03.016
and also always having a towel.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.047
So, good words to go by.

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.830
The metal bikini -- unfortunately,
this is where panic sets in --

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:10.056
like the modern bra,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.949
we have to make sure we remove,

00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:16.844
because this can cause
severe arcing along with burns.

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.221
But unfortunately this opens up an issue

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:22.168
that's almost as controversial
as talking about the prequels.

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:23.288
(Laughter)

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:25.198
The mere mention of the word "nipples,"

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:27.366
and people get into a little
bit of a tizzy.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.841
By the way, that is not a nipple,
that's a cupcake.

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.288
(Laughter)

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.185
Chances are, if you do have to use this,

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.147
this is going to be on someone you know.

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:38.871
And remember, everyone has nipples,

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.063
except for Jabba.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.352
(Laughter)

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:43.564
But he does love cupcakes.

00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:44.739
Speaking about Jabba,

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.279
if we do have to use an AED on him,

00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:49.145
remember pad placement is the same,

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.950
even though he doesn't have nipples.

00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:54.097
So it's going to be
upper right-hand side, lower left.

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:57.293
If we were going through, we're shocking,
getting ready to go --

00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:58.664
after we've done the shock,

00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:01.734
one of the things we need to do
is remember to do compression.

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:05.390
The preferred method
is 30 compressions and two breaths

00:04:05.414 --> 00:04:07.927
in the center of the chest,
between the nipples,

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:09.780
pressing down at least two inches,

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.748
no more than two and a half,

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.795
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.494
no more than 120.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.602
Unfortunately, due to the size
of Jabba's mouth

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.391
and also what he puts in said mouth,

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:26.848
we may not want to actually
do the mouth-to-mouth part.

00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:29.353
So instead, we can do
compression-only CPR.

00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:31.817
The way of remembering
the compression-only part

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.660
is we can actually use the Imperial March.

00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:36.601
I would sing it for you --

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:38.066
(Laughter)

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.947
Unfortunately, that would be more
something an interrogation droid would do.

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.193
Yoda.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.872
Small little guy, like a baby.

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.331
What we do is basically
treat him like a baby,

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.879
in the sense that we're going to place
one pad in the center of the chest

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:53.054
and one in the back.

00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:54.746
If we place them both in the front,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.340
they can be too close
and cause severe arcing,

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.849
so we want to avoid that.

00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:01.000
Hopefully, this helped to clarify

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:03.326
and put some light
on some of the darker issues

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.570
of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,

00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:07.058
or any universe in total.

00:05:07.082 --> 00:05:08.523
I'll leave you with one point.

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:11.339
Remember, if you do find yourself
dealing with a Wookiee,

00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:13.011
do not shave the entire Wookiee.

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:14.501
This takes way too much time,

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:16.013
and it only pisses them off.

00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:17.045
(Laughter)

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.233
Thank you very much.

00:05:18.257 --> 00:05:20.786
(Applause)
