00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:15.700
I want to tell you a story about a girl.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.447
But I can't tell you her real name.

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:20.748
So let's just call her Hadiza.

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:22.870
Hadiza is 20.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:24.610
She's shy,

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:27.868
but she has a beautiful smile
that lights up her face.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.709
But she's in constant pain.

00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:35.937
And she will likely be on medication
for the rest of her life.

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.371
Do you want to know why?

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:42.641
Hadiza is a Chibok girl,

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:45.898
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.546
by Boko Haram terrorists.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.799
She managed to escape, though,

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:54.020
by jumping off the truck
that was carrying the girls.

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:57.337
But when she landed,
she broke both her legs,

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.781
and she had to crawl on her tummy
to hide in the bushes.

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:04.883
She told me she was terrified
that Boko Haram would come back for her.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:10.151
She was one of 57 girls who would escape
by jumping off trucks that day.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.716
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.112
around the world.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.406
People like Michelle Obama,
Malala and others

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.522
lent their voices in protest,

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.807
and at about the same time --
I was living in London at the time --

00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:27.474
I was sent from London to Abuja
to cover the World Economic Forum

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:29.920
that Nigeria was hosting
for the first time.

00:01:30.475 --> 00:01:34.539
But when we arrived, it was clear
that there was only one story in town.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.574
We put the government under pressure.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.160
We asked tough questions
about what they were doing

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.675
to bring these girls back.

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:43.923
Understandably,

00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:46.754
they weren't too happy
with our line of questioning,

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:50.527
and let's just say we received
our fair share of "alternative facts."

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.232
(Laughter)

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.454
Influential Nigerians
were telling us at the time

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:58.475
that we were naÃ¯ve,

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.703
we didn't understand
the political situation in Nigeria.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.815
But they also told us

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.447
that the story of the Chibok girls

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:08.656
was a hoax.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:12.785
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.099
and there are still people
in Nigeria today

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:17.886
who believe that the Chibok girls
were never kidnapped.

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:21.314
Yet I was talking to people like these --

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.926
devastated parents,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.004
who told us that on the day
Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:32.602
they ran into the Sambisa Forest
after the trucks carrying their daughters.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:36.354
They were armed with machetes,
but they were forced to turn back

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:38.227
because Boko Haram had guns.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:42.828
For two years, inevitably,
the news agenda moved on,

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:44.582
and for two years,

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:47.765
we didn't hear much
about the Chibok girls.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.658
Everyone presumed they were dead.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:52.040
But in April last year,

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:54.269
I was able to obtain this video.

00:02:54.856 --> 00:02:56.596
This is a still from the video

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.734
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:03.287
and through a source,
I obtained this video.

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.466
But before I could publish it,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.515
I had to travel
to the northeast of Nigeria

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.606
to talk to the parents, to verify it.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:14.514
I didn't have to wait
too long for confirmation.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.780
One of the mothers,
when she watched the video, told me

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:21.504
that if she could have reached
into the laptop

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:25.547
and pulled our her child from the laptop,

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.977
she would have done so.

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:31.245
For those of you who are parents,
like myself, in the audience,

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.097
you can only imagine the anguish

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.580
that that mother felt.

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:43.975
This video would go on to kick-start
negotiation talks with Boko Haram.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.967
And a Nigerian senator told me
that because of this video

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:49.984
they entered into those talks,

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.514
because they had long presumed
that the Chibok girls were dead.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.161
Twenty-one girls were freed
in October last year.

00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:02.753
Sadly, nearly 200 of them
still remain missing.

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:07.708
I must confess that I have not been
a dispassionate observer

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:08.918
covering this story.

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:12.750
I am furious when I think
about the wasted opportunities

00:04:14.052 --> 00:04:15.241
to rescue these girls.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:19.165
I am furious when I think about
what the parents have told me,

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.963
that if these were daughters
of the rich and the powerful,

00:04:21.987 --> 00:04:24.148
they would have been found much earlier.

00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.109
And I am furious

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.061
that the hoax narrative,

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.963
I firmly believe,

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:34.099
caused a delay;

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:37.112
it was part of the reason
for the delay in their return.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.015
This illustrates to me
the deadly danger of fake news.

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.631
So what can we do about it?

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:47.620
There are some very smart people,

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:50.103
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:55.192
who are trying to use technology
to stop the spread of fake news.

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:59.967
But beyond that, I think
everybody here -- you and I --

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.178
we have a role to play in that.

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.495
We are the ones who share the content.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:07.030
We are the ones who share
the stories online.

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:09.241
In this day and age, we're all publishers,

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:12.846
and we have responsibility.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.180
In my job as a journalist,

00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:17.232
I check, I verify.

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:20.537
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.316
Why is this person telling me this story?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.839
What do they have to gain
by sharing this information?

00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:29.671
Do they have a hidden agenda?

00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:35.993
I really believe that we must all start
to ask tougher questions

00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:38.327
of information that we discover online.

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:47.224
Research shows that some of us
don't even read beyond headlines

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.351
before we share stories.

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:50.914
Who here has done that?

00:05:51.764 --> 00:05:53.099
I know I have.

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:55.614
But what if

00:05:57.115 --> 00:06:01.324
we stopped taking information
that we discover at face value?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.643
What if we stop to think
about the consequence

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.116
of the information that we pass on

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.351
and its potential to incite
violence or hatred?

00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:16.950
What if we stop to think
about the real-life consequences

00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:18.822
of the information that we share?

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:21.725
Thank you very much for listening.

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.243
(Applause)
