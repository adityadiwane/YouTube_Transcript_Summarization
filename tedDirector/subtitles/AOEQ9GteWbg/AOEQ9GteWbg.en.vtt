00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:18.929
So, this book that I have in my hand

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.863
is a directory of everybody who had an email address

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:26.382
in 1982. (Laughter)

00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:30.067
Actually, it's deceptively large.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.504
There's actually only about 20 people on each page,

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:35.394
because we have the name, address

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:38.487
and telephone number of every single person.

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:40.670
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.228
because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:48.129
Obviously a very small community.

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.560
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.160
I knew them both.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.916
We didn't all know each other,

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:58.029
but we all kind of trusted each other,

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:01.827
and that basic feeling of trust

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.414
permeated the whole network,

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.771
and there was a real sense that

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.777
we could depend on each other to do things.

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:13.352
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:14.977
let me tell you what it was like

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:19.082
to register a domain name in the early days.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:21.712
Now, it just so happened that I got to register

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:24.172
the third domain name on the Internet.

00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:25.820
So I could have anything I wanted

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.265
other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:33.679
So I picked think.com, but then I thought,

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.665
you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.874
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:44.158
And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:49.853
(Laughter)

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:53.482
That attitude of only taking what you need

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:57.526
was really what everybody had on the network in those days,

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:00.823
and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.543
but it was actually kind of built into the protocols

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:05.487
of the Internet itself.

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:09.346
So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:13.075
and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it,

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:17.204
were fundamentally "from each according to their ability,

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:19.322
to each according to their need."

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:22.335
And so, if you had some extra bandwidth,

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:23.778
you'd deliver a message for someone.

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:26.771
If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.785
You'd kind of depend on people to do that,

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.449
and that was the building block.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.076
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:36.512
was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:38.943
by the Defense Department,

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:42.013
but it obviously worked really well,

00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:45.456
and we all saw what happened with the Internet.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.728
It was incredibly successful.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.025
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.613
that these days you could make a book like this.

00:02:54.613 --> 00:03:00.779
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:01.953
But, of course, you couldn't do it,

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:03.743
because we don't know the names of all the people

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:06.817
with Internet or email addresses,

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.349
and even if we did know their names,

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.782
I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.078
address and telephone number published to everyone.

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:18.780
So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.951
and so we dealt with that by making

00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:24.850
walled communities,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.587
secure subnetworks, VPNs,

00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:31.183
little things that aren't really the Internet

00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:33.154
but are made out of the same building blocks,

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:35.394
but we're still basically building it out of those

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:39.661
same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.

00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:42.383
And that means that it's vulnerable

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.779
to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.640
or certain kinds of deliberate attacks,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.745
but even the mistakes can be bad.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:52.694
So, for instance,

00:03:52.694 --> 00:03:54.647
in all of Asia recently,

00:03:54.647 --> 00:03:58.080
it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.360
because Pakistan made some mistakes

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.095
in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:07.189
They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.093
because of the way that the protocols work.

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:13.317
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,

00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:15.908
you may remember a couple of years ago,

00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:18.721
all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:21.613
because a single routing card in Salt Lake City

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.975
had a bug in it.

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:26.248
Now, you don't really think

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:29.274
that our airplane system depends on the Internet,

00:04:29.274 --> 00:04:30.280
and in some sense it doesn't.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.896
I'll come back to that later.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.146
But the fact is that people couldn't take off

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:36.421
because something was going wrong on the Internet,

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.996
and the router card was down.

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:42.775
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.

00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:45.914
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:47.440
All of a sudden,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.772
a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,

00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:54.903
including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,

00:04:54.903 --> 00:04:57.671
started getting re-routed through China.

00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.393
So for a few hours, it all passed through China.

00:05:00.393 --> 00:05:04.967
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:08.824
and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:10.859
but certainly somebody could make

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:14.132
a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,

00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:17.490
and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.411
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:25.809
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.901
or Western civilization these days,

00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:30.090
they're not going to do it with tanks.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.503
That will not succeed.

00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:34.506
What they'll probably do is something

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:37.797
very much like the attack that happened

00:05:37.797 --> 00:05:40.504
on the Iranian nuclear facility.

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:42.778
Nobody has claimed credit for that.

00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:46.285
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.862
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:51.449
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.396
but it was possible for somebody to smuggle

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:55.928
a USB drive in there, or something like that,

00:05:55.928 --> 00:05:59.324
and software got in there that causes the centrifuges,

00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:02.317
in that case, to actually destroy themselves.

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.983
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery

00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:09.405
or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.

00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:12.671
And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.862
about worries about cyberattacks

00:06:14.862 --> 00:06:17.472
and defenses against those.

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:19.452
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.735
defending the computers on the Internet,

00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:24.121
and there's been surprisingly little attention

00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:28.486
to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.

00:06:28.486 --> 00:06:30.349
And I think we probably do need to pay

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.437
some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.

00:06:33.437 --> 00:06:36.364
So actually, in the early days,

00:06:36.364 --> 00:06:38.088
back when it was the ARPANET,

00:06:38.088 --> 00:06:41.677
there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:44.962
because one single message processor

00:06:44.962 --> 00:06:47.438
actually got a bug in it.

00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:49.710
And the way the Internet works is

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.277
the routers are basically exchanging information

00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:55.867
about how they can get messages to places,

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:59.765
and this one processor, because of a broken card,

00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:01.774
decided it could actually get a message

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:04.462
to some place in negative time.

00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:08.445
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.

00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:11.595
So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere

00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:13.471
was to send it to this guy,

00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:17.018
who would send it back in time and get it there super early,

00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:19.874
so every message in the Internet

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:23.116
started getting switched through this one node,

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:24.632
and of course that clogged everything up.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:26.787
Everything started breaking.

00:07:26.787 --> 00:07:28.827
The interesting thing was, though,

00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:30.667
that the sysadmins were able to fix it,

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:35.449
but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:36.847
Now, of course you couldn't do that today.

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:39.241
I mean, everything off, it's like

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.473
the service call you get from the cable company,

00:07:41.473 --> 00:07:45.234
except for the whole world.

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:47.293
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:49.915
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:52.884
use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on

00:07:52.884 --> 00:07:54.953
that go through the Internet right now,

00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:58.235
and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it

00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.027
for more and more different things,

00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:02.965
like when you take off from LAX,

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:04.846
you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.

00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:08.962
When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.

00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.087
What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:12.954
are beginning to use the Internet.

00:08:12.954 --> 00:08:16.004
Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet,

00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:18.540
but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.445
for administrative functions,

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:23.508
and so if you take something like the cell phone system,

00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:27.828
which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,

00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:30.787
Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it

00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:34.591
in terms of some of the control and administrative functions,

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:36.921
and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:39.185
because they work so well, they're cheap,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.285
they're repeated, and so on.

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:43.057
So all of our systems, more and more,

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:44.837
are starting to use the same technology

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:46.904
and starting to depend on this technology.

00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:49.329
And so even a modern rocket ship these days

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:52.055
actually uses Internet protocol to talk

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:53.871
from one end of the rocket ship to the other.

00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:57.057
That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.

00:08:57.057 --> 00:09:00.174
So we've built this system

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:03.284
where we understand all the parts of it,

00:09:03.284 --> 00:09:06.982
but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,

00:09:06.982 --> 00:09:09.421
and it's gotten a very, very different scale

00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.592
than it was designed for.

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:14.268
And in fact, nobody really exactly understands

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:16.531
all the things it's being used for right now.

00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.034
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:22.515
like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts

00:09:22.515 --> 00:09:25.121
but nobody really exactly understands

00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:28.348
how it operates and all the little details of it

00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:31.067
and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:34.200
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.895
and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,

00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:39.356
you should treat it with the same skepticism

00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:43.771
that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.038
or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.686
They have an informed opinion,

00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:51.227
but it's changing so quickly that even the experts

00:09:51.227 --> 00:09:53.045
don't know exactly what's going on.

00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:55.737
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet,

00:09:55.737 --> 00:09:57.403
it's just somebody's guess.

00:09:57.403 --> 00:09:59.601
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now

00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:02.342
because it's different than it was an hour ago.

00:10:02.342 --> 00:10:05.143
It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.

00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:06.657
And the problem with it is,

00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:09.998
I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster

00:10:09.998 --> 00:10:12.793
like the disaster we had in the financial system,

00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:18.137
where we take a system that's basically built on trust,

00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:20.758
was basically built for a smaller-scale system,

00:10:20.758 --> 00:10:23.667
and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:25.663
of how it was meant to operate.

00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:28.931
And so right now, I think it's literally true

00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:32.436
that we don't know what the consequences

00:10:32.436 --> 00:10:34.870
of an effective denial-of-service attack

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.643
on the Internet would be,

00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:38.517
and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,

00:10:38.517 --> 00:10:39.925
and worse next year, and so on.

00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:42.474
But so what we need is a plan B.

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:44.106
There is no plan B right now.

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:47.609
There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept

00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:49.555
to be independent of the Internet,

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:52.621
made out of completely different sets of building blocks.

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:55.634
So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:58.368
have to have the performance of the Internet,

00:10:58.368 --> 00:10:59.885
but the police department has to be able

00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:02.408
to call up the fire department even without the Internet,

00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:04.973
or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.

00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:09.587
This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.

00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:12.335
It's actually relatively simple to do, technically,

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:16.137
because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,

00:11:16.137 --> 00:11:18.096
existing wireless infrastructure.

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.861
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:23.345
But people won't decide to do it

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:25.724
until they recognize the need for it,

00:11:25.724 --> 00:11:27.222
and that's the problem that we have right now.

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:30.005
So there's been plenty of people,

00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:33.049
plenty of us have been quietly arguing

00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:35.967
that we should have this independent system for years,

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:38.976
but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B

00:11:38.976 --> 00:11:42.650
when plan A seems to be working so well.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.079
So I think that, if people understand

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.133
how much we're starting to depend on the Internet,

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:51.110
and how vulnerable it is,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.216
we could get focused on

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:56.240
just wanting this other system to exist,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.317
and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,

00:11:59.317 --> 00:12:02.327
I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.

00:12:02.327 --> 00:12:03.750
It's not that hard a problem.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.985
It could definitely be done by people in this room.

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:11.344
And so I think that this is actually,

00:12:11.344 --> 00:12:14.523
of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,

00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:17.201
this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.

00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.968
So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.

00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:22.579
Thank you very much.

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:26.433
