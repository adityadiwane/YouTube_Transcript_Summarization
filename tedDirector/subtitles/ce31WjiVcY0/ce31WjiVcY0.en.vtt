00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.716
You've heard of your I.Q.,
your general intelligence,

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.392
but what's your Psy-Q?

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.629
How much do you know
about what makes you tick,

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:22.374
and how good are you
at predicting other people's behavior

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:23.880
or even your own?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.159
And how much of what you think you know
about psychology is wrong?

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.947
Let's find out by counting down
the top 10 myths of psychology.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.343
You've probably heard it said
that when it comes to their psychology,

00:00:34.343 --> 00:00:37.225
it's almost as if men are from Mars
and women are from Venus.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.264
But how different
are men and women really?

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:41.518
To find out, let's start
by looking at something

00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:43.495
on which men and women really do differ

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:46.943
and plotting some psychological
gender differences on the same scale.

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:49.116
One thing men and women
do really differ on

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.913
is how far they can throw a ball.

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:52.803
So if we look at the data for men here,

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.274
we see what is called
a normal distribution curve.

00:00:55.274 --> 00:00:58.482
A few men can throw a ball really far,
and a few men not far at all,

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.252
but most a kind of average distance.

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.416
And women share
the same distribution as well,

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.465
but actually there's
quite a big difference.

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.913
In fact, the average man
can throw a ball further

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.620
than about 98 percent of all women.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.647
So now let's look at what
some psychological gender differences

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:14.504
look like on the same standardized scale.

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:16.090
Any psychologist will tell you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.635
that men are better
at spatial awareness than women --

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.373
so things like map-reading, 
for example -- and it's true,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.863
but let's have a look
at the size of this difference.

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:27.250
It's tiny; the lines are so close
together they almost overlap.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.244
In fact, the average woman is better
than 33 percent of all men,

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:33.125
and of course, if that was 50 percent,

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.181
then the two genders
would be exactly equal.

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:38.839
It's worth bearing in mind that this
difference and the next one I'll show you

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.664
are pretty much the biggest
psychological gender differences

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:43.101
ever discovered in psychology.

00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:44.212
So here's the next one.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:46.650
Any psychologist will tell you
that women are better

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.315
with language and grammar than men.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.904
So here's performance
on the standardized grammar test.

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.861
There go the women. There go the men.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.560
Again, yes, women are better on average,
but the lines are so close

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.047
that 33 percent of men
are better than the average woman,

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:01.720
and again, if it was 50 percent,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.462
that would represent
complete gender equality.

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:06.583
So it's not really
a case of Mars and Venus.

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:09.250
It's more a case of, if anything,
Mars and Snickers:

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.612
basically the same, but one's maybe 
slightly nuttier than the other.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.638
I won't say which.

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:17.503
Now we've got you warmed up.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.539
Let's psychoanalyze you using
the famous Rorschach inkblot test.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.122
So you can probably see two, I dunno,
two bears or two people or something.

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:25.875
But what do you think they're doing?

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.059
Put your hand up if you think
they're saying hello.

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.870
Not many people. Okay.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.337
Put your hands up if you think
they are high-fiving.

00:02:33.337 --> 00:02:35.307
Okay. What if you think they're fighting?

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:36.562
Only a few people there.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:39.639
Okay, so if you think they're
saying hello or high-fiving,

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.630
then that means you're a friendly person.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.220
If you think they're fighting,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.536
you're a bit more of a 
nasty, aggressive person.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:47.476
Are you a lover or a fighter, basically.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:48.763
What about this one?

00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:52.385
This isn't really a voting one, so on 
three everyone shout out what you see.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:55.549
One, two, three.
(Audience shouting)

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.241
I heard hamster. Who said hamster?

00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.778
That was very worrying.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.291
A guy there said hamster.

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:03.599
Well, you should see
some kind of two-legged animal here,

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.983
and then the mirror image of them there.

00:03:05.983 --> 00:03:09.414
If you didn't, then this means
that you have difficulty

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:13.504
processing complex situations
where there's a lot going on.

00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:15.729
Except, of course,
it doesn't mean that at all.

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.400
Rorschach inkblot tests
have basically no validity

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.675
when it comes to diagnosing
people's personality

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:23.136
and are not used
by modern-day psychologists.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.555
In fact, one recent study found
that when you do try

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:29.614
to diagnose people's personalities
using Rorschach inkblot tests,

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:31.356
schizophrenia was diagnosed

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:35.349
in about one sixth of apparently
perfectly normal participants.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.182
So if you didn't do that well on this,

00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:40.736
maybe you are not
a very visual type of person.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:43.105
So let's do another
quick quiz to find out.

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:46.883
When making a cake, do you prefer to --
so hands up for each one again --

00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:49.652
do you prefer to use
a recipe book with pictures?

00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:51.672
Yeah, a few people.

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.412
Have a friend talk you through?

00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:57.075
Or have a go, making it up
as you go along?

00:03:57.075 --> 00:03:58.567
Quite a few people there.

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:00.287
Okay, so if you said A,

00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:02.459
then this means that you
are a visual learner

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.987
and you learn best when information
is presented in a visual style.

00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:08.569
If you said B, it means
you're an auditory learner,

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.294
that you learn best when information
is presented to you in an auditory format.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.229
And if you said C, it means
that you're a kinesthetic learner,

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.630
that you learn best when you get stuck in
and do things with your hands.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.788
Except, of course,
as you've probably guessed,

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:23.607
that it doesn't, because
the whole thing is a complete myth.

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:27.465
Learning styles are made up and are 
not supported by scientific evidence.

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:31.021
So we know this because in
tightly controlled experimental studies,

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.142
when learners are given material to learn

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:35.762
either in their preferred style
or an opposite style,

00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:39.338
it makes no difference at all to the
amount of information that they retain.

00:04:39.338 --> 00:04:41.404
And if you think about it
for just a second,

00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:43.482
it's just obvious
that this has to be true.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:46.054
It's obvious that
the best presentation format

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:49.352
depends not on you,
but on what you're trying to learn.

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:51.479
Could you learn to drive a car,
for example,

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.897
just by listening to someone
telling you what to do

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:55.525
with no kinesthetic experience?

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:57.341
Could you solve simultaneous equations

00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.487
by talking them through in your head
and without writing them down?

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:02.588
Could you revise 
for your architecture exams

00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:05.261
using interpretive dance
if you're a kinesthetic learner?

00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.202
No. What you need to do 
is match the material to be learned

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:11.977
to the presentation format, not you.

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:14.126
I know many of you are A-level students

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:16.418
that will have recently gotten
your GCSE results.

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:18.976
And if you didn't quite get
what you were hoping for,

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.323
then you can't really blame
your learning style,

00:05:21.323 --> 00:05:24.950
but one thing that you might want
to think about blaming is your genes.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.635
So what this is all about is a
recent study at University College London

00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:31.189
found that 58 percent of the variation

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.440
between different students
and their GCSE results

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.097
was down to genetic factors.

00:05:36.097 --> 00:05:39.233
That sounds like a very precise figure,
so how can we tell?

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:42.738
Well, when we want to unpack
the relative contributions

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.842
of genes and the environment,

00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:47.071
what we can do is do a twin study.

00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.647
So identical twins share
100 percent of their environment

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:52.551
and 100 percent of their genes,

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:55.773
whereas non-identical twins
share 100 percent of their environment,

00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:59.509
but just like any brother and sister,
share only 50 percent of their genes.

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.707
So by comparing how similar
GCSE results are in identical twins

00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:06.018
versus non-identical twins,

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:07.364
and doing some clever math,

00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:11.265
we can an idea of how much variation
and performance is due to the environment

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:13.401
and how much is due to genes.

00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.178
And it turns out that it's
about 58 percent due to genes.

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:20.941
So this isn't to undermine the hard work
that you and your teachers here put in.

00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:24.072
If you didn't quite get the GCSE results
that you were hoping for,

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:28.578
then you can always try blaming
your parents, or at least their genes.

00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:30.606
One thing that you shouldn't blame

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:33.068
is being a left-brained
or right-brained learner,

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:34.879
because again, this is a myth.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.636
So the myth here is that
the left brain is logical,

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.435
it's good with equations like this,

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:43.534
and the right brain is more creative,
so the right brain is better at music.

00:06:43.534 --> 00:06:46.465
But again, this is a myth
because nearly everything that you do

00:06:46.465 --> 00:06:49.275
involves nearly all parts
of your brain talking together,

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:52.595
even just the most mundane thing
like having a normal conversation.

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:55.938
However, perhaps one reason
why this myth has survived

00:06:55.938 --> 00:06:58.180
is that there is
a slight grain of truth to it.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.790
So a related version of the myth

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.073
is that left-handed people are
more creative than right-handed people,

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:06.527
which kind of makes sense because
your brain controls the opposite hands,

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:07.887
so left-handed people,

00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:10.313
the right side of the brain
is slightly more active

00:07:10.313 --> 00:07:12.118
than the left-hand side of the brain,

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:14.606
and the idea is the right-hand side
is more creative.

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.003
Now, it isn't true per se

00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:19.204
that left-handed people are more creative
than right-handed people.

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.619
What is true that ambidextrous people,

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.312
or people who use both hands
for different tasks,

00:07:24.312 --> 00:07:28.074
are more creative thinkers
than one-handed people,

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:29.807
because being ambidextrous involves

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.536
having both sides of the brain
talk to each other a lot,

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:36.298
which seems to be involved
in creating flexible thinking.

00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:38.113
The myth of the creative left-hander

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:40.171
arises from the fact
that being ambidextrous

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:43.298
is more common amongst 
left-handers than right-handers,

00:07:43.298 --> 00:07:46.347
so a grain of truth in the idea
of the creative left-hander,

00:07:46.347 --> 00:07:47.694
but not much.

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:50.131
A related myth that you've
probably heard of

00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:52.504
is that we only use
10 percent of our brains.

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.030
This is, again, a complete myth.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.749
Nearly everything that we do,
even the most mundane thing,

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.932
uses nearly all of our brains.

00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:02.693
That said, it is of course true

00:08:02.693 --> 00:08:07.273
that most of us don't use our brainpower
quite as well as we could.

00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:10.239
So what could we do
to boost our brainpower?

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.377
Maybe we could listen
to a nice bit of Mozart.

00:08:12.377 --> 00:08:15.095
Have you heard of the idea
of the Mozart effect?

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:18.052
So the idea is that listening 
to Mozart makes you smarter

00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:20.221
and improves your 
performance on I.Q. tests.

00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:22.326
Now again, what's interesting
about this myth

00:08:22.326 --> 00:08:25.767
is that although it's basically a myth,
there is a grain of truth to it.

00:08:25.767 --> 00:08:27.541
So the original study found that

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.322
participants who were played
Mozart music for a few minutes

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:33.621
did better on a subsequent I.Q. test

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:37.034
than participants who simply
sat in silence.

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:40.758
But a follow-up study recruited
some people who liked Mozart music

00:08:40.758 --> 00:08:42.539
and then another group of people

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.207
who were fans of 
the horror stories of Stephen King.

00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:48.771
And they played the people
the music or the stories.

00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:51.279
The people who preferred
Mozart music to the stories

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.010
got a bigger I.Q. boost
from the Mozart than the stories,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.848
but the people who preferred
the stories to the Mozart music

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:59.955
got a bigger I.Q. boost
from listening to the Stephen King stories

00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:01.170
than the Mozart music.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.933
So the truth is that listening
to something that you enjoy

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:07.184
perks you up a bit
and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost

00:09:07.184 --> 00:09:09.111
on a narrow range of tasks.

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.479
There's no suggestion that
listening to Mozart,

00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:13.104
or indeed Stephen King stories,

00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:16.526
is going to make you any smarter
in the long run.

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:19.466
Another version of the Mozart myth

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:24.324
is that listening to Mozart can make you
not only cleverer but healthier, too.

00:09:24.324 --> 00:09:26.392
Unfortunately, this doesn't
seem to be true

00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:29.451
of someone who listened
to the music of Mozart almost every day,

00:09:29.451 --> 00:09:31.169
Mozart himself,

00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:34.149
who suffered from gonorrhea,
smallpox, arthritis,

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:38.663
and, what most people think eventually
killed him in the end, syphilis.

00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:42.035
This suggests that Mozart
should have bit more careful, perhaps,

00:09:42.035 --> 00:09:44.613
when choosing his sexual partners.

00:09:44.613 --> 00:09:46.772
But how do we choose a partner?

00:09:46.772 --> 00:09:51.798
So a myth that I have to say
is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists

00:09:51.798 --> 00:09:55.421
is that our preferences in a romantic 
partner are a product of our culture,

00:09:55.421 --> 00:09:57.352
that they're very culturally specific.

00:09:57.352 --> 00:09:59.496
But in fact, the data don't back this up.

00:09:59.496 --> 00:10:03.541
A famous study surveyed people from
[37] different cultures across the globe,

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:05.117
from Americans to Zulus,

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:07.483
on what they look for in a partner.

00:10:07.483 --> 00:10:09.852
And in every single culture
across the globe,

00:10:09.852 --> 00:10:13.567
men placed more value
on physical attractiveness in a partner

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:14.867
than did women,

00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:16.608
and in every single culture, too,

00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:21.222
women placed more importance than did men
on ambition and high earning power.

00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:22.605
In every culture, too,

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:25.130
men preferred women
who were younger than themselves,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.939
an average of, I think it was 2.66 years,

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.588
and in every culture, too,

00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:32.188
women preferred men
who were older than them,

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:34.998
so an average of 3.42 years,

00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:38.713
which is why we've got here
"Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."

00:10:38.713 --> 00:10:41.290
So moving on from trying
to score with a partner

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.212
to trying to score in basketball
or football or whatever your sport is.

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:49.353
The myth here is that sportsmen go through
hot-hand streaks, Americans call them,

00:10:49.353 --> 00:10:51.553
or purple patches,
we sometimes say in England,

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:54.393
where they just can't miss,
like this guy here.

00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:58.077
But in fact, what happens is that
if you analyze the pattern

00:10:58.077 --> 00:10:59.865
of hits and misses statistically,

00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:02.164
it turns out that it's
nearly always at random.

00:11:02.164 --> 00:11:04.579
Your brain creates patterns
from the randomness.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:05.936
If you toss a coin,

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:09.572
a streak of heads or tails is going 
to come out somewhere in the randomness,

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:12.683
and because the brain likes to see
patterns where there are none,

00:11:12.683 --> 00:11:15.284
we look at these streaks
and attribute meanings to them

00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:17.591
and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"

00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:19.901
whereas actually you would
get the same pattern

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:22.546
if you were just getting
hits and misses at random.

00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:26.872
So an exception to this, however,
is penalty shootouts.

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:29.957
A recent study looking
at penalty shootouts in football

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.977
shows that players who represent countries

00:11:31.977 --> 00:11:34.601
with a very bad record
in penalty shootouts,

00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:36.784
like, for example, England,

00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:40.545
tend to be quicker to take their shots
than countries with a better record,

00:11:40.545 --> 00:11:43.865
and presumably as a result,
they're more likely to miss.

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:45.560
Which raises the question

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.949
of if there's any way that we
could improve people's performance.

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:50.947
And one thing you might think about doing

00:11:50.947 --> 00:11:54.366
is punishing people for their misses
and seeing if that improves them.

00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:57.998
This idea, the effect that punishment
can improve performance,

00:11:57.998 --> 00:12:00.204
is what participants
thought they were testing

00:12:00.204 --> 00:12:02.736
in Milgram's famous learning
and punishment experiment

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:05.744
that you've probably heard about
if you're a psychology student.

00:12:05.744 --> 00:12:08.566
The story goes that participants
were prepared to give

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:11.867
what they believed to be fatal
electric shocks to a fellow participant

00:12:11.867 --> 00:12:13.888
when they got a question wrong,

00:12:13.888 --> 00:12:16.697
just because someone
in a white coat told them to.

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:19.112
But this story is a myth
for three reasons.

00:12:19.112 --> 00:12:24.016
Firstly and most crucially, the lab coat
wasn't white, it was in fact grey.

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:28.423
Secondly, the participants
were told before the study

00:12:28.423 --> 00:12:30.930
and reminded any time
they raised a concern,

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.763
that although the shocks were painful,
they were not fatal

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:36.505
and indeed caused
no permanent damage whatsoever.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:38.825
And thirdly, participants
didn't give the shocks

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.473
just because someone
in the coat told them to.

00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:43.515
When they were interviewed
after the study,

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:46.023
all the participants said
that they firmly believed

00:12:46.023 --> 00:12:49.807
that the learning and punishment study
served a worthy scientific purpose

00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:52.245
which would have
enduring gains for science

00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:58.114
as opposed to the momentary nonfatal
discomfort caused to the participants.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:01.603
Okay, so I've been talking
for about 12 minutes now,

00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:04.289
and you've probably been 
sitting there listening to me,

00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:06.509
analyzing my speech patterns 
and body language

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:10.116
and trying to work out if you should
take any notice of what I'm saying,

00:13:10.116 --> 00:13:12.577
whether I'm telling the truth
or whether I'm lying,

00:13:12.577 --> 00:13:14.759
but if so you've
probably completely failed,

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.104
because although we all think
we can catch a liar

00:13:17.104 --> 00:13:19.197
from their body language
and speech patterns,

00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:21.870
hundreds of psychological tests
over the years have shown

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.561
that all of us, including
police officers and detectives,

00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:28.061
are basically at chance when it comes
to detecting lies from body language

00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:29.642
and verbal patterns.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.686
Interestingly, there is one exception:

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.938
TV appeals for missing relatives.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.923
It's quite easy to predict
when the relatives are missing

00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:40.254
and when the appealers have in fact
murdered the relatives themselves.

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:43.769
So hoax appealers are more likely
to shake their heads, to look away,

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:45.483
and to make errors in their speech,

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:47.498
whereas genuine appealers are more likely

00:13:47.498 --> 00:13:49.843
to express hope that the person
will return safely

00:13:49.843 --> 00:13:51.584
and to avoid brutal language.

00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:56.187
So, for example, they might say
"taken from us" rather than "killed."

00:13:56.187 --> 00:13:58.844
Speaking of which,
it's about time I killed this talk,

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:02.052
but before I do, I just want 
to give you in 30 seconds

00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:05.423
the overarching myth of psychology.

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:09.720
So the myth is that psychology is just
a collection of interesting theories,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.241
all of which say something useful
and all of which have something to offer.

00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:15.740
What I hope to have shown you
in the past few minutes

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.325
is that this isn't true.

00:14:17.325 --> 00:14:20.584
What we need to do is assess
psychological theories

00:14:20.584 --> 00:14:22.468
by seeing what predictions they make,

00:14:22.468 --> 00:14:25.289
whether that is that listening to Mozart
makes you smarter,

00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:30.056
that you learn better when information is
presented in your preferred learning style

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:33.521
or whatever it is, all of these
are testable empirical predictions,

00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:35.306
and the only way we can make progress

00:14:35.306 --> 00:14:37.426
is to test these predictions
against the data

00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:39.755
in tightly controlled
experimental studies.

00:14:39.755 --> 00:14:42.889
And it's only by doing so
that we can hope to discover

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:45.513
which of these theories
are well supported,

00:14:45.513 --> 00:14:48.903
and which, like all the ones
I've told you about today, are myths.

00:14:48.903 --> 00:14:50.412
Thank you.

00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:53.872
(Applause)
