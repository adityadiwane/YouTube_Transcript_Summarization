00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:17.553
What does it mean to spend our time well?

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.982
I spend a lot of my time

00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:25.616
thinking about how to spend my time.

00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:29.201
Probably too much --
I probably obsess over it.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:30.670
My friends think I do.

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:35.181
But I feel like I kind of have to,
because these days,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:39.086
it feels like little bits of my time
kind of slip away from me,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.628
and when that happens, it feels like
parts of my life are slipping away.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.237
Specifically,

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.110
it feels like little bits
of my time get slipped away

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:50.738
to various things like this,

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.729
like technology -- I check things.

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:54.804
I'll give you an example.

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:57.577
If this email shows up --

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.286
how many of you have gotten
an email like this, right?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.608
I've been tagged in a photo.

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:05.487
When this appears,

00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:08.922
I can't help but click on it right now.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:11.487
Right? Because, like,
what if it's a bad photo?

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.216
So I have to click it right now.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:16.029
But I'm not just going
to click "See photo,"

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:18.951
what I'm actually going to do
is spend the next 20 minutes.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.152
(Laughter)

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:24.213
But the worst part is that I know
this is what's going to happen,

00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:27.682
and even knowing
that's what's going to happen

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.522
doesn't stop me
from doing it again the next time.

00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:34.633
Or I find myself in a situation like this,

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.671
where I check my email
and I pull down to refresh,

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.515
But the thing is that 60 seconds later,

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.670
I'll pull down to refresh again.

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.947
Why am I doing this?

00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:53.779
This doesn't make any sense.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.508
But I'll give you a hint
why this is happening.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:04.865
What do you think makes
more money in the United States

00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:11.221
than movies, game parks
and baseball combined?

00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:14.983
Slot machines.

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.892
How can slot machines make all this money

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.583
when we play with such small
amounts of money?

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:27.680
We play with coins.

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:28.979
How is this possible?

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:32.082
Well, the thing is ...

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.575
my phone is a slot machine.

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.797
Every time I check my phone,

00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:42.138
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.354
what am I going to get?

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.085
What am I going to get?

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.950
Every time I check my email,

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.426
I'm playing the slot machine,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.061
saying, "What am I going to get?"

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.806
Every time I scroll a news feed,

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:55.276
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.882
what am I going to get next?

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.497
And the thing is that,

00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:02.613
again, knowing exactly
how this works -- and I'm a designer,

00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:04.914
I know exactly how
the psychology of this works,

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:06.793
I know exactly what's going on --

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:09.059
but it doesn't leave me with any choice,

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:11.134
I still just get sucked into it.

00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:13.983
So what are we going to do?

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:18.012
Because it leaves us
with this all-or-nothing relationship

00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:19.516
with technology, right?

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:22.016
You're either on,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.885
and you're connected
and distracted all the time,

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.759
or you're off,

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.037
but then you're wondering,

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.686
am I missing something important?

00:03:30.352 --> 00:03:32.606
In other words, you're either distracted

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.504
or you have fear of missing out.

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.520
Right?

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:42.924
So we need to restore choice.

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:46.462
We want to have
a relationship with technology

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:50.692
that gives us back choice
about how we spend time with it,

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.773
and we're going to need
help from designers,

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:57.467
because knowing this stuff doesn't help.

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.543
We're going to need design help.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:01.494
So what would that look like?

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.463
So let's take an example that we all face:

00:04:05.487 --> 00:04:07.533
chat -- text messaging.

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:09.666
So let's say there's two people.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.846
Nancy's on the left
and she's working on a document,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.077
and John's on the right.

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.306
And John suddenly remembers,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.933
"I need to ask Nancy
for that document before I forget."

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:23.958
So when he sends her that message,

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:26.068
it blows away her attention.

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:30.844
That's what we're doing all the time,
bulldozing each other's attention,

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:32.282
left and right.

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.072
And there's serious cost to this,

00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:37.165
because every time
we interrupt each other,

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.976
it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.840
to refocus our attention.

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:47.212
We actually cycle through
two different projects

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.945
before we come back
to the original thing we were doing.

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:55.147
This is Gloria Mark's research
combined with Microsoft research,

00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:56.529
that showed this.

00:04:56.553 --> 00:05:00.508
And her research also shows
that it actually trains bad habits.

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.977
The more interruptions we get externally,

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:07.762
it's conditioning and training us
to interrupt ourselves.

00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:11.883
We actually self-interrupt
every three-and-a-half minutes.

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:14.327
This is crazy.

00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.652
So how do we fix this?

00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:18.926
Because Nancy and John are in this
all-or-nothing relationship.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.451
Nancy might want to disconnect,

00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:21.828
but then she'd be worried:

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.903
What if I'm missing something important?

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.259
Design can fix this problem.

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.344
Let's say you have
Nancy again on the left,

00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:30.540
John on the right.

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:33.255
And John remembers,
"I need to send Nancy that document."

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.508
Except this time,

00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:36.469
Nancy can mark that she's focused.

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:38.461
Let's say she drags a slider and says,

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:40.408
"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:41.867
so -- bam -- she's focused.

00:05:42.771 --> 00:05:45.391
Now when John wants to message her,

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:47.542
he can get the thought off of his mind --

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:49.639
because he has a need,
he has this thought,

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:52.090
and he needs to dump it out
before he forgets.

00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:54.266
Except this time,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.594
it holds the messages
so that Nancy can still focus,

00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:01.161
but John can get the thought
off of his mind.

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:06.074
But this only works
if one last thing is true,

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:10.584
which is that Nancy needs to know
that if something is truly important,

00:06:11.564 --> 00:06:13.242
John can still interrupt.

00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.271
But instead of having constant
accidental or mindless interruptions,

00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:22.977
we're now only creating
conscious interruptions,

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:26.506
So we're doing two things here.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.632
We're creating a new choice
for both Nancy and John,

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:33.242
But there's a second, subtle thing
we're doing here, too.

00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:37.151
And it's that we're changing
the question we're answering.

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:40.910
Instead of the goal of chat being:

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:45.253
"Let's design it so it's easy
to send a message" --

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:46.707
that's the goal of chat,

00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.426
it should be really easy to send
a message to someone --

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:52.888
we change the goal to something
deeper and a human value,

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:57.116
which is: "Let's create the highest
possible quality communication

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.623
in a relationship between two people.

00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:02.027
So we upgraded the goal.

00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:06.643
Now, do designers
actually care about this?

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:11.696
Do we want to have conversations
about what these deeper human goals are?

00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:14.297
Well, I'll tell you one story.

00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.391
A little over a year ago,

00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:20.495
I got to help organize a meeting

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:25.391
between some of technology's leading
designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.

00:07:26.297 --> 00:07:31.134
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international
spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.

00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.909
And it was the most amazing meeting.

00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:34.953
You have to imagine -- picture a room --

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:38.830
on one side of the room,
you have a bunch of tech geeks;

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:40.350
on the other side of the room,

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:45.355
you have a bunch of long brown robes,
shaved heads, Buddhist monks.

00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:49.673
And the questions were about
the deepest human values,

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:52.015
like what does the future
of technology look like

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.254
when you're designing
for the deepest questions

00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:55.761
and the deepest human values?

00:07:56.445 --> 00:08:00.135
And our conversation centered
on listening more deeply

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.087
to what those values might be.

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.636
He joked in our conversation

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.608
that what if, instead of a spell check,

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.582
you had a compassion check,

00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:13.969
meaning, you might highlight a word
that might be accidentally abrasive --

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.907
perceived as abrasive by someone else.

00:08:16.844 --> 00:08:20.815
So does this kind of conversation
happen in the real world,

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.961
not just in these design meetings?

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:25.092
Well, the answer is yes,

00:08:25.116 --> 00:08:27.413
and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.

00:08:28.413 --> 00:08:30.866
If you didn't know,
Couchsurfing is a website

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.775
that matches people
who are looking for a place to stay

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.670
with a free couch, from someone
who's trying to offer it.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.728
So, great service --

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.416
what would their design goal be?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.187
What are you designing
for if you work at Couchsurfing?

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.735
Well, you would think
it's to match guests with hosts.

00:08:49.589 --> 00:08:50.739
Right?

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.018
That's a pretty good goal.

00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:54.961
But that would kind of be like
our goal with messaging before,

00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:57.350
where we're just trying
to deliver a message.

00:08:57.374 --> 00:08:59.516
So what's the deeper, human goal?

00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:02.120
Well, they set their goal

00:09:02.144 --> 00:09:07.798
as the need to create lasting,
positive experiences and relationships

00:09:07.822 --> 00:09:09.981
between people who've never met before.

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.926
And the most amazing thing
about this was in 2007,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.591
they introduced a way to measure this,

00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:18.066
which is incredible.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.397
I'll tell you how it works.

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:20.968
For every design goal you have,

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:23.060
you have to have
a corresponding measurement

00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:24.633
to know how you're doing --

00:09:24.657 --> 00:09:25.992
a way of measuring success.

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:27.312
So what they do is,

00:09:27.336 --> 00:09:29.779
let's say you take two people who meet up,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.765
and they take the number of days
those two people spent together,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.480
and then they estimate how many
hours were in those days --

00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:43.953
how many hours did
those two people spend together?

00:09:43.977 --> 00:09:46.112
And then after they spend
that time together,

00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:47.326
they ask both of them:

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.308
How positive was your experience?

00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:52.381
Did you have a good experience
with this person that you met?

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:56.322
And they subtract
from those positive hours

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.663
the amount of time
people spent on the website,

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:03.139
because that's a cost to people's lives.

00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:05.426
Why should we value that as success?

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:07.522
And what you were left with

00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:12.287
is something they refer to as "net
orchestrated conviviality,"

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.993
or, really, just a net
"Good Times" created.

00:10:15.017 --> 00:10:20.049
The net hours that would have never
existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.759
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be
to come to work every day

00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:26.276
and measure your success

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.329
in the actual net new contribution
of hours in people's lives

00:10:31.353 --> 00:10:33.954
that are positive,
that would have never existed

00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:36.788
if you didn't do what you were
about to do at work today?

00:10:37.692 --> 00:10:42.672
Can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way?

00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:46.319
Can you imagine a social network that --

00:10:46.343 --> 00:10:47.926
let's say you care about cooking,

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.981
and it measured its success
in terms of cooking nights organized

00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:53.970
and the cooking articles
that you were glad you read,

00:10:53.994 --> 00:10:56.971
and subtracted from that the articles
you weren't glad you read

00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:59.558
or the time you spent scrolling
that you didn't like?

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:03.505
Imagine a professional social network

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:07.444
that, instead of measuring its success
in terms of connections created

00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:09.057
or messages sent,

00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:13.393
instead measured its success in terms
of the job offers that people got

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.246
that they were excited to get.

00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:19.919
And subtracted the amount of time
people spent on the website.

00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:23.678
Or imagine dating services,

00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:25.440
like maybe Tinder or something,

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:28.942
where instead of measuring the number
of swipes left and right people did,

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:31.050
which is how they measure success today,

00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:37.219
instead measured the deep, romantic,
fulfilling connections people created.

00:11:38.613 --> 00:11:40.672
Whatever that was for them, by the way.

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:47.114
But can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way,

00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:49.390
that was helping you spend your time well?

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.038
Now to do this you also need a new system,

00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:54.740
because you're probably thinking,

00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:56.319
today's Internet economy --

00:11:56.343 --> 00:11:57.776
today's economy in general --

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.070
is measured in time spent.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.141
The more users you have,

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:02.543
the more usage you have,

00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:03.885
the more time people spend,

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:05.567
that's how we measure success.

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:08.351
But we've solved this problem before.

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:11.901
We solved it with organic,

00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:14.859
when we said we need
to value things a different way.

00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:17.819
We said this is a different kind of food.

00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:21.116
So we can't compare it
just based on price;

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.980
this is a different category of food.

00:12:23.004 --> 00:12:25.737
We solved it with Leed Certification,

00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:29.208
where we said this
is a different kind of building

00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:33.379
that stood for different values
of environmental sustainability.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.548
What if we had something
like that for technology?

00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:44.969
What if we had something
whose entire purpose and goal

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:49.266
was to help create net new positive
contributions to human life?

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.326
And what if we could
value it a different way,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.848
so it would actually work?

00:12:56.634 --> 00:13:00.565
Imagine you gave this different
premium shelf space on app stores.

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:02.924
Imagine you had web browsers
that helped route you

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.422
to these kinds of design products.

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:11.973
Can you imagine how exciting it would be
to live and create that world?

00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.932
We can create this world today.

00:13:16.978 --> 00:13:19.750
Company leaders, all you have to do --

00:13:19.774 --> 00:13:22.662
only you can prioritize a new metric,

00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:27.549
which is your metric for net positive
contribution to human life.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.624
And have an honest
conversation about that.

00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:31.809
Maybe you're not
doing so well to start with,

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:33.524
but let's start that conversation.

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:40.730
Designers, you can redefine success;
you can redefine design.

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:44.687
Arguably, you have more power
than many people in your organization

00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.634
to create the choices
that all of us live by.

00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.712
Maybe like in medicine,

00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:51.594
where we have a Hippocratic oath

00:13:51.618 --> 00:13:55.740
to recognize the responsibility
and this higher value

00:13:55.764 --> 00:13:57.331
that we have to treat patients.

00:13:57.355 --> 00:13:59.395
What if designers had something like that,

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.251
in terms of this new kind of design?

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:04.673
And users, for all of us --

00:14:04.697 --> 00:14:08.200
we can demand technology
that works this way.

00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:10.843
Now it may seem hard,

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:15.264
but McDonald's didn't have salads
until the consumer demand was there.

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:20.722
Walmart didn't have organic food
until the consumer demand was there.

00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:25.491
We have to demand
this new kind of technology.

00:14:26.194 --> 00:14:27.475
And we can do that.

00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:29.604
And doing that

00:14:29.628 --> 00:14:33.145
would amount to shifting
from a world that's driven and run

00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:35.739
entirely on time spent,

00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:41.186
to world that's driven by time well spent.

00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:45.656
I want to live in this world,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.768
and I want this conversation to happen.

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:50.436
Let's start that conversation now.

00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:52.858
Thank you.

00:14:52.882 --> 00:14:54.777
(Applause)
