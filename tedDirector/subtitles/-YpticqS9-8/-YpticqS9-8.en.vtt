00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and talk about a different Africa.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the Africa of disasters.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
While it is true that those things are going on,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is the Africa of opportunity.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
their own futures and their own destinies.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I want to start by telling you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a story about that change in Africa.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that went into some dormant accounts

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that belonged to him and his family.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
between the London Metropolitan Police

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and ran from London back to Nigeria where,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
according to our constitution, those in office

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
as governors, president -- as in many countries --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and the governments are trying hard to fight this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So when you hear about corruption,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that you can't operate in any African country

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and is being won. In others, like mine,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The results are showing:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
show that in many instances the trend is downwards

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And let me say just one more thing

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
before I leave this area of governance.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
All the time when they talk about it

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
you immediately think about Africa.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
if the other people who had taken money, estimated at

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
what is that? Is that not corruption?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
about what is happening on the other side of the globe --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
on asset recovery, trying to do what we can

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to get the monies that have been taken abroad --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
it may be far more for some of these countries

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
than all the aid that is being put together.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(Applause)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We are grateful, but we know that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And this is what we started to do

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I want to tell you that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Laughter)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
(Laughter)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
What we started to do was to realize

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And with the support of a leader

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we put forward a comprehensive reform program,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
which we developed ourselves.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We put together a program that would, one: get the state

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The state should not be in the business

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of producing goods and services

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because it's inefficient and incompetent.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Applause)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Can you believe that prior to this reform --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You had to do everything to get your phone.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
When President Obasanjo supported and launched

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
(Laughter)

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The smartest one, first to come in,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
was the MTN company of South Africa.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So the market is there.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Nigerians themselves began to develop

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
some wireless telecommunications companies,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and three or four others have come in.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But there's a huge market out there,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So privatization is one of the things we've done.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Because nobody's going to help you and support you

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
if you're not managing your own finances well.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that de-linked our budget from the oil price.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
at a price slightly lower than the oil price

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and save whatever was above that price.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But what it immediately did was that the volatility

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that had been present in terms of our economic development --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
When they crashed, we crashed.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
due to proper management of our finances.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
have a predictability of prices in the economy.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
to about 6.5 percent now.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
what was remarkable is that much of this growth came

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
once you get the macro-economy straightened out,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that without the proper legislation to make that possible,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that is comparable with some of the best in the world.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
no shopping malls as you know them here.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
This was an investment opportunity for someone

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that excited the imagination of people.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So, huge things in construction, real estate,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
mortgage markets. Financial services:

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that they increase their capital -- share capital.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And that's what many people know East Africa for:

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But managing the tourism market in a way

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that can really benefit the people is very important.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that there's a new wave on the continent.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
more than two-thirds of African countries have had

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
multi-party democratic elections.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but the trend is very clear.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the average rate of growth on the continent has moved

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So it's clear that things are changing.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Conflicts are down on the continent;

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
we are down to three or four conflicts --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
if something is going on in one part of the continent,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
it looks like the entire continent is affected.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But you should know that this continent is not --

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
is a continent of many countries, not one country.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And if we are down to three or four conflicts,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in stable, growing, exciting economies

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
where there's plenty of opportunity.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And I want to just make one point about this investment.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
The best way to help Africans today

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
is to help them to stand on their own feet.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and make sure that their children go to school,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
on the continent are the women.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
(Applause)

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And this is a video that has actually won an award

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
as the best documentary of the year.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Understand that the woman who made it

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
making children's clothes --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Mixing African materials, such as we have,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
with materials from elsewhere.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
(Laughter)

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
For 10,000 pieces.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I could go on giving examples:

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
because nobody believes outside of our countries

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
will miss it forever.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
that their fellow men and women are employed,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and that the children in those households get educated

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
because their parents are earning adequate income.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
for you to get involved in something that will do good

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
(Applause)
