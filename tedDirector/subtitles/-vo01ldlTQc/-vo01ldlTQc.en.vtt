00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about reimagining food.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I've been interested in food for a long time.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I taught myself to cook

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
with a bunch of big books like this.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I went to chef school in France.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And there is a way

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
the world both envisions food,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
the way the world writes about food and learns about food.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And it's largely what you would find in these books.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And it's a wonderful thing.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
But there's some things that have been going on

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
since this idea of food was established.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
In the last 20 years,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
people have realized that science

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
has a tremendous amount to do with food.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
In fact, understanding why cooking works

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
requires knowing the science of cooking --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
But that's not in any of those books.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
There's also a tremendous number of techniques

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that chefs have developed,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
None of the techniques that these people have developed

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
over the course of the last 20 years

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
is in any of those books.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
None of them are taught in cooking schools.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And finally,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
there's the old way of viewing food

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
is the old way.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
I set out to say, is there a way

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
we can communicate science and technique and wonder?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Is there a way we can show people food

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
in a way they have not seen it before?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
This is a picture called a cutaway.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
This is actually the first picture I took in the book.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The idea here is to explain what happens

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
when you steam broccoli.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And this magic view allows you to see

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
all of what's happening

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
while the broccoli steams.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Then each of the different little pieces around it

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
explain some fact.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
And the hope was two-fold.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
into stuff that was a little more technical,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
than they otherwise would have.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Because with that beautiful photo,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
maybe I can also package this little box here

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that talks about how steaming and boiling

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
actually take different amounts of time.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Steaming ought to be faster.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and this explains that.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Well, that first cutaway picture worked,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
so we said, "Okay, let's do some more."

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So here's another one.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
This shaped wok doesn't work very well;

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
this caught fire three times.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
But we had a philosophy,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
(Laughter)

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And one of our canning cutaways.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And each of these text blocks

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
explains a key thing that's going on.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
In this case, boiling water canning

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
is for canning things that are already pretty acidic.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
You don't have to heat them up as hot

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
as you would something you do pressure canning

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So this is great for pickled vegetables,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
which is what we're canning here.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Here's our hamburger cutaway.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
One of our philosophies in the book

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
is that no dish

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
is really intrinsically any better than any other dish.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So you can lavish

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
all the same care, all the same technique,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
on a hamburger

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
as you would on some much more fancy dish.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
it gets to be a little bit involved.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
The New York Times ran a piece

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
after my book was delayed

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Just Got Longer."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
it does take about 30 hours.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Most of the time is kind of sitting there.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
The point of this cutaway

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and to explain the physics of hamburgers

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and the chemistry of hamburgers,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
in particular, those flames underneath the burger.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So it's the fat that drips down and flares up

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that causes the characteristic taste.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Most people assume we use Photoshop.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And the answer is: no, not really;

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
we use a machine shop.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
is to actually cut them in half.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
(Laughter)

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
The manufacturer said,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
I said, "It would have to show up free."

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And so it showed up, we used it a little while,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
we cut it in half.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
We would glue a piece of Pyrex

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
or heat-resistant glass in front.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
The great thing is, when you cut something in half,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
you have another half.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
So you photograph that in exactly the same position,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and then you can substitute in --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and then they take the wires away digitally

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
so you're flying through the air.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
In most cases, though, there was no glass.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
we kept having to put them back up.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
The wok shot caught fire three times.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
What happens when you have your wok cut in half

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
is the oil goes down into the fire

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and whoosh!

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
But hey, they grow back.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
In addition to cutaways,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
we also explain physics.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It's a partial differential equation.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
We have the only cookbook in the world

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
that has partial differential equations in it.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But to make them palatable,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
and photographed it like this.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Everybody knows that your various appliances

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
have wattage, right?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It's a little couple paragraphs

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
and where he got his inspiration.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
to understand why they were burning so damn much peat

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
to distill the whiskey.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
We also did a lot of calculation.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
to write this cookbook.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Here's a calculation

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
that shows how the intensity of a barbecue,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
or other radiant heat source, goes

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
as you move away from it.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
So as you move vertically away from this surface,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
the heat falls off.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
As you move side to side, it moves off.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
That horn-shaped region

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
is what we call the sweet spot.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
So that's the place where you really want to cook.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
which as far as I know, again,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
the first cookbook to ever do this.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
You know, there's two ways

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
you can make a product.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
You can do lots of market research

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and do focus groups

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and figure out what people really want,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
or you can just kind of go for it

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and make the book you want and hope other people like it.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
If you really want great hamburger,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And it's really simple, as you can see here.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and you just take it off in little passes,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
build it up, slice it vertically.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Here's the final hamburger.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
This is the 30-hour hamburger.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
We make every aspect of this burger.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
We also have things about how to make the bun.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
The popcorn is illustrating

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
a key thing in physics.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
We have a very high-speed camera,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
which we had lots of fun with on the book.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
The key physics principle here

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
is when water boils to steam

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
it expands by a factor of 1,600.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
So it's a great illustration of that.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
We have a chapter on gels.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
I thought, well, let's put in a recipe

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
for a ballistics gelatin.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Well, if you have a high-speed camera,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
pretty soon somebody does this.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
(Gasps)

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Now the amazing thing here

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
it falls back down as a nice block.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Anyway, here's the book.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
Here it is.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
2,438 pages.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
And they're nice big pages too.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:47.260
(Applause)

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
A friend of mine complained

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
so there's a sixth volume

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
that has washable, waterproof paper.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.260
(Applause)
