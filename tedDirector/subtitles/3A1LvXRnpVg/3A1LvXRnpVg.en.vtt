00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:17.635
I love my food.

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.441
And I love information.

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.756
My children usually tell me

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:27.218
that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:29.302
(Laughter)

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:31.552
But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.760
is to take you through how those passions developed,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.120
the point in my life when the two passions merged,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.085
the journey of learning that took place from that point.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.881
And one idea I want to leave you with today

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.487
is what would would happen differently in your life

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:52.129
if you saw information the way you saw food?

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.300
I was born in Calcutta --

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.135
a family where my father and his father before him

00:00:58.135 --> 00:00:59.862
were journalists,

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:02.885
and they wrote magazines in the English language.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.093
That was the family business.

00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:06.843
And as a result of that,

00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:09.802
I grew up with books everywhere around the house.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.247
And I mean books everywhere around the house.

00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:15.718
And that's actually a shop in Calcutta,

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:19.220
but it's a place where we like our books.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.522
In fact, I've got 38,000 of them now

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:25.000
and no Kindle in sight.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.415
But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.937
with people to talk to about those books,

00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:36.008
this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.

00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.518
By the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:42.039
It wasn't the only passion I had.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.173
I was a South Indian

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:46.320
brought up in Bengal.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800
And two of the things about Bengal:

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.312
they like their savory dishes

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:53.124
and they like their sweets.

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:54.895
So by the time I grew up,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.550
again, I had a well-established passion for food.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.706
Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:05.166
and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.483
but these two were the ones that differentiated me.

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:09.843
(Laughter)

00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:12.694
And then life was fine, dandy.

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.352
Everything was okay,

00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:18.231
until I got to about the age of 26,

00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.843
and I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:23.843
Oh, some of you have seen it.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:27.218
And apparently it's being remade right now

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:29.247
and it's going to be coming out next year.

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:32.666
It's the story of this experimental robot

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:35.623
which got electrocuted and found a life.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:39.760
And as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input."

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.264
And I suddenly realized that for a robot

00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:45.733
both information as well as food

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.927
were the same thing.

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:50.552
Energy came to it in some form or shape,

00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:52.689
data came to it in some form or shape.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.135
And I began to think,

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:56.885
I wonder what it would be like

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.329
to start imagining myself

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.710
as if energy and information were the two things I had as input --

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.767
as if food and information were similar in some form or shape.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:11.158
I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.587
and started finding out

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:16.295
that actually human beings as primates

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.910
have far smaller stomachs

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.144
than should be the size for our body weight

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:25.079
and far larger brains.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.373
And as I went to research that even further,

00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:31.968
I got to a point where I discovered something

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:35.362
called the expensive tissue hypothesis.

00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:39.452
That actually for a given body mass of a primate

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:42.015
the metabolic rate was static.

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:45.773
What changed was the balance of the tissues available.

00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:49.393
And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:53.162
are nervous tissue and digestive tissue.

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:57.339
And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.844
that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.

00:04:01.844 --> 00:04:04.802
It's a lady named Leslie Aiello.

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:09.594
And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:13.302
If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:16.449
you had to live with a smaller gut.

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.283
That then set me off completely

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:22.003
to say, Okay, these two are connected.

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:26.189
So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.010
and said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.385
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.135
Does that really explain what we're seeing

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:37.885
with the intellectual property battles nowadays?

00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:41.218
Because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:44.885
wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.510
and those that were in the business of farming information

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.885
wanted to build fences around it,

00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:53.556
create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.

00:04:53.556 --> 00:04:56.520
So there was always going to be a tension within that.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.577
And everything I saw in the cultivation

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:01.135
said there were huge fights amongst the foodies

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.362
between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.

00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:05.677
And this is happening here.

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:08.558
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.885
expect that there were two schools.

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.968
One group of people said you can distill your information,

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:17.343
you can extract value, separate it and serve it up,

00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:19.087
while another group turned around

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:20.824
and said no, no you can ferment it.

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.489
You bring it all together and mash it up

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.578
and the value emerges that way.

00:05:25.578 --> 00:05:28.239
The same is again true with information.

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:31.958
But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.315
Because what I began to see then

00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:37.760
was there were so many different ways people would consume this.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.248
They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.

00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:42.389
Do you cook it? Do you have it served to you?

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.077
Do you go to a restaurant?

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:47.851
The same is true every time as I started thinking about information.

00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:50.364
The analogies were getting crazy --

00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:53.060
that information had sell-by dates,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.010
that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.343
and could really make an effect on the stock market,

00:05:59.343 --> 00:06:01.746
on corporate values, etc.

00:06:01.746 --> 00:06:04.142
And by this time I was hooked.

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:07.137
And this is about 23 years into this process.

00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:09.427
And I began to start thinking of myself

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:12.898
as we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,

00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:16.385
docu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.845
Are we going to reach the stage

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:22.403
where information has a percentage for fact associated with it?

00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:25.840
We start labeling information for the fact percentage?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.468
Are we going to start looking at what happens

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:32.047
when your information source is turned off, as a famine?

00:06:32.047 --> 00:06:34.614
Which brings me to the final element of this.

00:06:34.614 --> 00:06:37.760
Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.927
there is only filter failure.

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:43.552
I put it to you that information,

00:06:43.552 --> 00:06:45.949
if viewed from the point of food,

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.835
is never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.031
Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.

00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.052
And we have to start thinking

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:59.433
about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:01.968
to have the faculties to be able to deal with information,

00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:05.718
to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.552
In fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying,

00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:11.510
What would happen

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.704
if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?

00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:17.068
(Laughter)

00:07:17.068 --> 00:07:19.970
Would there be time to be able to work with it?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.933
So you start really understanding

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:29.287
that you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:32.198
and once you start looking, and from that point on,

00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:35.885
everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,

00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:39.215
the production of information, the preparation of information,

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:42.748
I've looked at from the viewpoint of food.

00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:45.218
It has probably not helped my waistline any

00:07:45.218 --> 00:07:47.706
because I like practicing on both sides.

00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:51.427
But I'd like to leave you with just that question:

00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:54.410
If you began to think of all the information that you consume

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.993
the way you think of food,

00:07:55.993 --> 00:07:57.767
what would you do differently?

00:07:57.767 --> 00:07:59.968
Thank you very much for your time.

00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:01.858
(Applause)
