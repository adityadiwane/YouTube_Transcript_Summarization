00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
On simplicity. What a great way to start.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
First of all, I've been watching this trend

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
where we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity,"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And so in my life, I've discovered that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because your companies will always take away your life,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but they can never take away your vacation -- in theory.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Laughter)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
"Business Takes Simplicity."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And she has this show, "The Simple Life."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, I looked for a different show to watch.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
They'll play it over, and over, and over.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So it was traumatizing, actually.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And when you drive, these signs are very important.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But then I thought, "Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I mean that simplicity sky.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We're human beings: we love complex things.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm at this place called the Media Lab.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
(Laughter)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Last year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in addition to my previous titles.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Another "Associate Director of Research."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And this also happened, so I have five daughters now.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
(Laughter)

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But looking way back, when I was a child --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's very hard work to make tofu.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We were a great model. So, I loved going to school.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
School was great, and maybe going to school

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Thank you.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and I discovered design later on in my life.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And she's very important in my life,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
She passed away in 1994,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Some of you guys know Paul Rand,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The great graphic designer Paul Rand

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He basically said, "I've designed everything."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
When you have mentors -- and yesterday,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
because you can remember them in their pure form.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the mentors calm us down.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, I've always been Googling this word, "human,"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
to find out how many hits I get.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
because computers are against humans a bit,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, if you sort of compare that, like this,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you'll see that computer versus human --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I've been tracking this for the last year --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
computer versus human over the last year has changed.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Very good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So if you compare complexities to simplicity,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
it's also catching up in a way, too.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Lots of complex stuff.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So, I hid in a time dimension.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I built things in a time-graphics dimension.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you're cooler for some reason.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
This is why they have fireworks in the summer.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
A very extreme culture.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
because I have so many leaves in my yard.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And so I made a lot of these types of things.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I feel kind of bad about that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
She has this show right now at MoMA,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
If you're in New York, please go and see that.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and people say, "Oh, I know your work.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You're the guy that makes eye candy."

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"Eye candy" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
(Laughter)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
something more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Computer programs are essentially trees,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Whenever you make art with a computer program,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
you're always on the tree, and the paradox is that

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So, this is sort of a complication I've found.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You can't type very much on this.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
But I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So I have a crash test.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(Laughter)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
just to sort of understand what these things are.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I was concerned with contemporary art

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and so I wanted to think about something happy.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So I focused on food as my area --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
these sort of clementine peel things.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
actually, in different forms.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
so I made this amber waves image.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
so I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And with these Cheetos, I began to think,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
"What can I make with these Cheetos?"

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I was looking for some kind of form,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(Laughter)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
People ask me how they make the antenna.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Sometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
My hair's clean -- it's okay.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
End of story.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
(Laughter)

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But I realized that life could be very boring,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The car is so big, the camera is so small,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It doesn't make any sense.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Laughter)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word "simplicity,"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
In the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and also that's why it's on the Web for free.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
People hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Because I want to simplify them for you.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
a big cookie or a small cookie,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
When you want less, it's because it's about work.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
with more enjoyment and less pain.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I think this is sort of simple more versus less.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Basically, it always depends.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
because you're trying to simplify your life.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Like everything you see, every time you wake up.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
From everything from a weird hotel lobby,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to Saran wrap placed over your window,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
because life is finite.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Also, if you look at your physical strength.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and your vision goes after that.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
(Laughter)

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Your social responsibility is very interesting.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
that's very good, too.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But if any of you people ask,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
What's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
