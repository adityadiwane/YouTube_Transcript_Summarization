00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:20.465
By day, I'm a venture capitalist.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.036
On weekends, I love rockets.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.809
I love photography, I love rockets.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.991
I'm going to talk
about a hobby that can scale

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:28.123
and show you photos
I've taken over the years

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:31.252
with kids like these, that hopefully
will grow up to love rocketry

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:33.774
and eventually become
a Richard Branson or Diamandis.

00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:36.807
My son designed a rocket
that became stable, a golf ball rocket.

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.084
I thought it was quite
an interesting experiment

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:40.850
in the principles of rocket science.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.600
And it flies straight as an arrow.

00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:43.977
Baking soda and vinegar.

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.311
Night shots are beautiful,

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.862
piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.085
2-stage rockets
with video cameras on them,

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.887
onboard computers logging their flights,
rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.154
I use RockSim to simulate
flights before they go

00:00:57.178 --> 00:00:58.853
to see if they'll break supersonic,

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:01.698
then fly them with onboard computers
to verify performance.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.399
To launch the big stuff,
you go to the middle of nowhere:

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:06.758
Black Rock Desert,
where dangerous things happen.

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:08.521
The boys and the rockets get bigger.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:11.156
They use motors
used on cruise-missile boosters.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.909
They rumble the belly and leave
even photographers in awe,

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.084
watching the spectacle.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.894
These rockets use
experimental motors like nitrous oxide.

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.919
They use solid propellant most frequently.

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.282
It's a strange kind of love.

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:24.514
RocketMavericks.com with my photos,
if you want to learn about this,

00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:25.874
participate, be a spectator.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.875
We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.773
This one was great, went to 100,000 feet
-- but didn't quite.

00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:34.074
Actually, it went 11 feet into solid clay
and became a bunker-buster.

00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:35.522
It had to be dug out.

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:39.298
Rockets often spiral out of control
if you put too much propellant in them.

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:40.481
Here was a drag race.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.745
At night you can see
what happened in a second;

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.541
in daytime, we call them land sharks.

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:47.852
Sometimes they just explode
before your eyes or come down supersonic.

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:48.885
(Laughter)

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.386
To take this shot, I did what I often do,
which is go way beyond the pads,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.010
where none of the spectators are.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.614
And if we can run the video,
I'll show you what it took

00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:57.985
to get this DreamWorks shot.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.666
(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.576
Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computer
failed, they're yelling "Deploy!"

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.751
(Video) Man: Oh, shit.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.404
SJ: This is when they realize
everything's gone haywire.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.049
(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:11.224
SJ: I'll just be quiet.

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:12.399
(Video) Woman: No!

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.423
Come on, come on, come on.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.092
SJ: And that's me over there,
taking photos the whole way.

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.472
Things often go wrong.

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:26.769
Some people watch this
because of a NASCAR-like fascination

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:28.428
with things bumping and grinding.

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:31.169
Burning the parachute as it fell.
That was last weekend.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.923
This guy went up, went supersonic,
ripped the fin can off.

00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:35.098
The art sale in the sky.

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.701
A burning metal hunk coming back.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.543
These things dropped
down from above all through the weekend

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.357
of rocket launch after rocket launch.

00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:43.275
It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.175
I try to capture the mishaps;
it's a challenge in photography

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.793
when these things take place
in a fraction of a second.

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:50.348
Why do it? For things like this:

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:52.519
Gene from Alabama drives out there

00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:55.615
with this rocket he's built
with X-ray sensors, video cameras,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.930
festooned with electronics.

00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:58.675
He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.379
leaving the atmosphere,
seeing a thin blue line of space.

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:04.795
It is this breathtaking image --
success, of course -- that motivates us

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.606
and motivates kids to follow
and understand rocket science,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.734
understand the importance
of physics and math

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:12.093
and, in many ways,
to have that awe at exploration

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.651
of the frontiers of the unknown.

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:14.826
Thank you.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.098
(Applause)
