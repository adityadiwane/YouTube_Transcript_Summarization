00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
As an artist,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
connection is very important to me.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Through my work I'm trying to articulate

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
that humans are not separate from nature

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and that everything is interconnected.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
where I saw my first icebergs.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I was in awe.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
The icebergs around me

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
were almost 200 feet out of the water,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and I could only help but wonder

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that this was one snowflake

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
on top of another snowflake,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
year after year.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Icebergs are born

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
when they calve off of glaciers

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
or break off of ice shelves.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
They have a distinct way

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
of interacting with their environment

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and their experiences.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Some refuse to give up

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and hold on to the bitter end,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
while others can't take it anymore

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that they're isolated,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
that they're separate and alone,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
But the reality is far from it.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
As an iceberg melts,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
I am breathing in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
its ancient atmosphere.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
As the iceberg melts,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.260
it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that nourishes many forms of life.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I approach photographing these icebergs

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
knowing that in these individual moments

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
they exist in that way

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and will never exist that way again.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
It is not a death when they melt;

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
it is not an end,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
but a continuation

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
of their path through the cycle of life.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
a couple thousand years old.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And some of the ice

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is over 100,000 years old.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
The last pictures I'd like to show you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
are of an iceberg that I photographed

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
It's a very rare occasion

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
that you get to actually witness

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
an iceberg rolling.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
So here it is.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
You can see on the left side a small boat.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That's about a 15-foot boat.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And I'd like you to pay attention

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to the shape of the iceberg

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
and where it is at the waterline.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
You can see here, it begins to roll,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
It's about 120 feet above the water,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
or 40 meters.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And this video is real time.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.260
(Music)

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And just like that,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Thank you.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.260
(Applause)
