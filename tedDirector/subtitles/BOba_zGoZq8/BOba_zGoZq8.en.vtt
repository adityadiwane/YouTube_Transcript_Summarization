00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.160
And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
And then I was an entertainer, I guess.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
and I never wound up going into college.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
(Laughter)

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
It's really cool.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
at least from my small aperture of the world.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
And then you go to these toy companies

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
and there's some guy across the table,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
You know, you think it's so cool, but they --

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
This is the name of my company, Giving Toys.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
So I used to work at Mattel, actually.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.160
And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and then got the license to make the maker.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
So this is a hamburger maker that

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
I beat up the pasta maker to make that.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
This, now that's the McNugget maker,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
she's about 300 pounds now.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
No, she's not, she's beautiful.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
This is how they looked when they came out at the end.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160
This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
That paid the rent for about a month.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
This is a walking Barbie -- I said, "Oh, this is it!"

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
And they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
They're pretty cool.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
It does pretty good.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
It's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160
This is a clay maker.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
and said, "Look, I can animate this."

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
They said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
And then, I made a Lego animator.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I thought, this would be so great!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
That's the answer. They know everything about it.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
Then I started doing animatronics.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
I loved dinosaurs.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
I used to be in the film business, kind of,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
and anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160
That's David Letterman.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
You can see how old this stuff is.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
That's my youngest cousin.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.160
This is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
My career basically peaked here.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.160
This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And I'm really not very good at it.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
But the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
This is a -- you can see the little window there.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.160
You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160
You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Way ahead of my time here.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:45.160
(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Narrator: I love toys!

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
that was the first batch of products.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Most of them did not go.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And every now and then, we do something like a,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.160
But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
And I started working on this project

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Throughout this whole thing, making toys,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
There's some kind of a blend that happens

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
that allows, you know, to find innovation.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
that means something, to me anyway.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
that's where I think innovation happens.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
But it's not how you actually get leverage.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
But moving on.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
So by way of showing you this, you can kind of

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
get an understanding of what it is to,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.160
hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
that has an emotional connection with the user.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160
So this is my family.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.160
and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
All right, there's that robot again.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
I came out of the movie business, as I said,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
and I said, let's make these animatronic robots.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Let's make these things.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
And so I've always had a big interest in this.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160
This one actually didn't go anywhere,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160
but I got my feet wet doing this.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160
There's another one.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Oh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
working on the Microsoft Barney.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.160
And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
full of this stuff and see if they sell.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.160
What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And so, I have all these design books,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160
like I'm sure many of you have.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160
And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
I have kind of the art and science.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
I have the why over here, and the how over there.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Because they're not just "bing" ideas;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
you have to really dig deep in these things.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
So there's some real pseudo-code over here,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160
And then we said, well, you're going to feed him,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160
And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160
to make the eyes move, and the ears move,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160
and the body to move, and the mouth to move.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160
And, you know, I want to make it blink

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
and do all that at the same time.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
Well, I came up with this kind of linear

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
Then I started to get a little more realistic

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160
and I have to start drawing the stuff.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
And there's my "note to self" at the top:

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160
"lots of engineering."

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
So that turned out to be a little more than true.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
and the little worm drive and all that stuff.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
And then I've got to start building it,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160
so this is the real thing.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160
I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And that's my little workshop.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
And there's the first little cam that drove Furby.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And there's Furby on the half shell.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160
(Laughter)

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
So right now, you see, I love little robots.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
So she comes to the rescue.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160
This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
my muse and my partner for eternity here.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160
And she does drawings, right?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
She's an actual, you know, artist.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160
And she starts doing all these different drawings

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
and does color patterns and coloring books.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
He didn't test so well, but I like him.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
And then she started doing these other images.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.160
And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
There's my favorite, Demon Furby.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
That was a good one.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
little poufy body, a little imaginary character.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
ripped it apart and made this.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
And since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
with dolls or something, they disappear from my desk

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
and they get hidden in the house.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160
I have three girls and they just, they --

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
(Laughter)

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.160
So, a little tether coming off,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
It's just a little server control and I made a little video going:

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
you know, and then I'd reach my hand.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
He'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
said, "Yeah, we want to do this.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
and we're going to hire you guys to do this."

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
And so Dave and I got working.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160
I don't know how to do.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160
And I started working with Solid Works

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
and a whole other group to do that.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160
And we started --

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
this was way back before there was really much SLA going on,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160
not a lot of rapid prototyping.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
We certainly didn't have the money to do this.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
so I had to call a friend of a friend

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.160
who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160
And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160
We snuck in on the weekend.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
And so we just had a disc of the files.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
And on the weekend we ran the parts for that.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
So this is how they come out close to the end.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
And then they looked like little Garfields there.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
Eight months later -- you may remember this,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
this was a -- total, total, total chaos.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
And I just a little bit on each one.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160
So full circle -- why do I do this?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff?

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.160
And it's, of course, for your kids.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160
And she still actually has those.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
up in Boise, on a river, you know. So

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
and then I started another company called Toy Innovation

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.160
and we did some projects with Mattel with

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160
actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
and we did Miracle Moves Baby,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And then I started another company.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160
We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
won "Best Innovations" at CES,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160
I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
and then people started to want to do it.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
And they said they'd spend all this time.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
So I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160
The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
as much as we can with today's technology.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
And it's not really -- but as close as we can do.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
And we're going to try to really pull this off,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
So I picked a Camarasaurus,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160
That's a juvenile.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160
And so we actually went in.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
There's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
And the picture from the book, so when I --

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
Very, very obsessive.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
but the geometry's correct.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
And then I went in, and measured all the geometry

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
because I figured, hey, biomimicry.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
So there's the motor.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Here's an example of what we did with the skull.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
There's the mechanism that would go in there,

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160
kind of a Geneva drive.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
There's some Solid Works versions of it.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.160
There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
it has kind of a cuteness already.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
And the thing about blending science and art

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
and then you go back and do the shape,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160
and then you go back and forth.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.160
They had to fit within the envelope.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
All the neck and the tail are cable,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
so it moves smoothly and organically.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
And then, of course, you're not done yet.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
You have to get the look for the skin.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160
of the character.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
Now, this is not -- we're character designers, right?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
And we're still trying to keep with the real character.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
Now you start doing the sculpture for this.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.160
And you can see we got a guy from --

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160
to do the sculpting for us,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160
down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
And then, four years and 10 million dollars later,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
we have a little Pleo.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
John, do you want to bring him up?

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
that's done most of the work with our 40-person company.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
(Applause)

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
So, thank you, John, thank you,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
and get back to work, all right, man?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160
All right --

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.160
(Laughter)

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160
-- no, it's very painful, so --

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
(Laughter)

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160
-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
So when you first get them, they're babies.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
And you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.160
and they kind of learn through their behavior.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160
So this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160
So this guy's listening to my voice here.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
But they have 40 sensors all over their body.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
They have seven processors, they have 14 motors,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
they have --

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160
but you don't care, do you?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.160
They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
There's something big and loud over here.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Hey.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
(Laughter)

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160
Yeah, they're like kids, you know.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.160
I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.160
Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
(Laughter)

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160
There you go.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:23.160
That's what the investors think, that it's just --

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160
(Laughter)

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
-- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
And we're hoping that -- you know,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160
our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160
in order to be more human.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
And we think we can help that out by having

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
little creatures that you can love.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
They do change over time.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.160
And we have a -- I have a little something here.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.160
Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.160
We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
We did include some things that are hopefully useful.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160
Excuse me, Pleo.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
so it's completely open architecture.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160
So anyone can plug him -- (Applause) -- thank you.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
This is John over here.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a --

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160
(Laughter) --

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.160
you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.160
We -- actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.160
We have one animator who's taken it and

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160
he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
and they're going, "Whassup," you know?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
(Laughter)

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.160
You -- so it's -- yes, he likes that.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160
So they're a handful. We hope you get one.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
I don't know what I'm missing to say,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160
but as a last thing, I'd like to say is that

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.160
if we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.160
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.160
And so I just -- I hope we all dream well.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Thank you.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:19.160
(Applause)
