00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:18.219
In 2011, during the final six months
of Kim Jong-Il's life,

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.199
I lived undercover in North Korea.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.259
I was born and raised
in South Korea, their enemy.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.751
I live in America, their other enemy.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.067
Since 2002, I had visited
North Korea a few times.

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:41.785
And I had come to realize
that to write about it with any meaning,

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.617
or to understand the place
beyond the regime's propaganda,

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:51.352
the only option was total immersion.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.360
So I posed as a teacher and a missionary

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.148
at an all-male university in Pyongyang.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.001
The Pyongyang University
of Science and Technology

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:15.934
was founded by Evangelical Christians
who cooperate with the regime

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.428
to educate the sons
of the North Korean elite,

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:25.100
without proselytizing,
which is a capital crime there.

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:33.897
The students were 270 young men,
expected to be the future leaders

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:38.964
of the most isolated and brutal
dictatorship in existence.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.951
When I arrived, they became my students.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.618
2011 was a special year,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:55.883
marking the 100th anniversary of the birth
of North Korea's original Great Leader,

00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:57.366
Kim Il-Sung.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.361
To celebrate the occasion, the regime
shut down all universities,

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.195
and sent students off to the fields

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.353
to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal

00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:14.019
as the world's most powerful
and prosperous nation.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.855
My students were the only ones
spared from that fate.

00:02:21.502 --> 00:02:25.165
North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:28.470
Everything there
is about the Great Leader.

00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:33.804
Every book, every newspaper article,
every song, every TV program --

00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:35.480
there is just one subject.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.911
The flowers are named after him,

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:40.807
the mountains are carved with his slogans.

00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:45.188
Every citizen wears the badge
of the Great Leader at all times.

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.043
Even their calendar system begins
with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:56.259
The school was a heavily guarded
prison, posing as a campus.

00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:02.373
Teachers could only leave on group outings
accompanied by an official minder.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.333
Even then, our trips were limited
to sanctioned national monuments

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:11.164
celebrating the Great Leader.

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:16.250
The students were not allowed
to leave the campus,

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:18.912
or communicate with their parents.

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:24.886
Their days were meticulously mapped out,
and any free time they had

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.302
was devoted to honoring
their Great Leader.

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:34.428
Lesson plans had to meet the approval
of North Korean staff,

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:38.657
every class was recorded and reported on,
every room was bugged,

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.379
and every conversation, overheard.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:48.413
Every blank space was covered with the 
portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:51.048
like everywhere else in North Korea.

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:55.945
We were never allowed
to discuss the outside world.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.979
As students of science and technology,
many of them were computer majors

00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:03.612
but they did not know
the existence of the Internet.

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:08.413
They had never heard
of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:13.533
Facebook, Twitter -- none of those things
would have meant a thing.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:17.048
And I could not tell them.

00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.211
I went there looking for truth.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:25.781
But where do you even start
when an entire nation's ideology,

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:27.798
my students' day-to-day realities,

00:04:27.823 --> 00:04:31.774
and even my own position
at the universities,

00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:34.649
were all built on lies?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.080
I started with a game.

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.582
We played "Truth and Lie."

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.332
A volunteer would write a sentence
on the chalkboard,

00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:48.107
and the other students had to guess

00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.134
whether it was a truth or a lie.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:55.361
Once a student wrote, "I visited
China last year on vacation,"

00:04:55.385 --> 00:04:57.993
and everyone shouted, "Lie!"

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.293
They all knew this wasn't possible.

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:05.273
Virtually no North Korean is allowed
to leave the country.

00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:09.618
Even traveling within their own country
requires a travel pass.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.846
I had hoped that this game would reveal
some truth about my students,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.933
because they lie so often and so easily,

00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:25.370
whether about the mythical
accomplishments of their Great Leader,

00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:29.432
or the strange claim that they cloned
a rabbit as fifth graders.

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:36.399
The difference between truth and lies
seemed at times hazy to them.

00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:40.514
It took me a while to understand
the different types of lies;

00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:43.514
they lie to shield their system
from the world,

00:05:43.538 --> 00:05:47.393
or they were taught lies,
and were just regurgitating them.

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:50.035
Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:56.425
But if all they have ever known were lies,

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.949
how could we expect them to be otherwise?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.889
Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.

00:06:04.408 --> 00:06:06.649
But that turned out to be
nearly impossible.

00:06:07.225 --> 00:06:11.044
Essays are about coming up with
one's own thesis,

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:14.973
and making an evidence-based
argument to prove it.

00:06:16.044 --> 00:06:19.961
These students, however, were
simply told what to think,

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:21.135
and they obeyed.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.163
In their world, critical thinking
was not allowed.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.511
I also gave them the weekly assignment
of writing a personal letter,

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:32.685
to anybody.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.484
It took a long time, but eventually
some of them began to write

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.183
to their mothers, their friends,
their girlfriends.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.471
Although those were just homework,

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:49.051
and would never reach
their intended recipients,

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:53.145
my students slowly began to reveal
their true feelings in them.

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:58.522
They wrote that they were fed
up with the sameness of everything.

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:01.379
They were worried about their future.

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:06.711
In those letters, they rarely ever
mentioned their Great Leader.

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:13.822
I was spending all of my time
with these young men.

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:19.044
We all ate meals together,
played basketball together.

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:24.084
I often called them gentlemen,
which made them giggle.

00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:26.821
They blushed at the mention of girls.

00:07:28.332 --> 00:07:30.300
And I came to adore them.

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:34.340
And watching them open up
even in the tiniest of ways,

00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:36.434
was deeply moving.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:39.881
But something also felt wrong.

00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:43.822
During those months
of living in their world,

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:48.665
I often wondered if the truth would,
in fact, improve their lives.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.850
I wanted so much to tell them the truth,

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:58.294
of their country and of the outside world,

00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:02.309
where Arab youth were turning
their rotten regime inside out,

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.128
using the power of social media,

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:08.850
where everyone except them was
connected through the world wide web,

00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:11.715
which wasn't worldwide after all.

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:17.000
But for them, the truth was dangerous.

00:08:18.955 --> 00:08:23.854
By encouraging them to run after it,
I was putting them at risk --

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.235
of persecution,

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:27.610
of heartbreak.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:33.413
When you're not allowed to express
anything in the open,

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:36.318
you become good at reading
what is unspoken.

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:42.760
In one of their personal letters to me,
a student wrote that he understood

00:08:42.784 --> 00:08:45.626
why I always called them gentlemen.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.433
It was because I was wishing them
to be gentle in life, he said.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.544
On my last day in December of 2011,

00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:00.318
the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.990
their world shattered.

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:07.380
I had to leave without a proper goodbye.

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:11.205
But I think they knew
how sad I was for them.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.245
Once, toward the end of my stay,
a student said to me,

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:21.743
"Professor, we never think of you
as being different from us.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:27.874
Our circumstances are different,
but you're the same as us.

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:32.016
We want you to know that we truly
think of you as being the same."

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:41.806
Today, if I could respond
to my students with a letter of my own,

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.306
which is of course impossible,

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.929
I would tell them this:

00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:52.525
"My dear gentlemen,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.524
It's been a bit over three years
since I last saw you.

00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:59.795
And now, you must be 22 --
maybe even as old as 23.

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:04.165
At our final class, I asked you
if there was anything you wanted.

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:09.241
The only wish you expressed,
the only thing you ever asked of me

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:12.683
in all those months we spent together,

00:10:12.707 --> 00:10:14.633
was for me to speak to you in Korean.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.310
Just once.

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.560
I was there to teach you English;

00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:21.101
you knew it wasn't allowed.

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:27.875
But I understood then, you wanted
to share that bond of our mother tongue.

00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:33.282
I called you my gentlemen,

00:10:33.306 --> 00:10:37.727
but I don't know if being gentle
in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:38.933
is a good thing.

00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:42.044
I don't want you to lead a revolution --

00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:44.072
let some other young person do it.

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:48.581
The rest of the world might casually
encourage or even expect

00:10:48.605 --> 00:10:50.955
some sort of North Korean Spring,

00:10:50.979 --> 00:10:53.501
but I don't want you to do anything risky,

00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:57.369
because I know in your world,
someone is always watching.

00:10:59.027 --> 00:11:01.511
I don't want to imagine
what might happen to you.

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:07.167
If my attempts to reach you have
inspired something new in you,

00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:08.741
I would rather you forget me.

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:13.985
Become soldiers of your Great Leader,
and live long, safe lives.

00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:21.060
You once asked me if I thought
your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,

00:11:21.084 --> 00:11:23.776
and I could not answer truthfully then.

00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:26.990
But I know why you asked.

00:11:27.493 --> 00:11:32.024
I know that it was important for you
to hear that I, your teacher,

00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:35.909
the one who has seen the world
that you are forbidden from,

00:11:35.933 --> 00:11:39.260
declare your city as the most beautiful.

00:11:41.793 --> 00:11:46.948
I know hearing that would make
your lives there a bit more bearable,

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:50.339
but no, I don't find
your capital beautiful.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.529
Not because it's monotone and concrete,

00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:55.416
but because of what it symbolizes:

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.273
a monster that feeds off
the rest of the country,

00:12:00.297 --> 00:12:03.170
where citizens are soldiers and slaves.

00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.342
All I see there is darkness.

00:12:09.932 --> 00:12:12.380
But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:18.660
And I hope instead that you,
my lovely young gentlemen,

00:12:18.684 --> 00:12:21.178
will one day help make it beautiful.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.158
Thank you.

00:12:24.183 --> 00:12:29.348
(Applause)
