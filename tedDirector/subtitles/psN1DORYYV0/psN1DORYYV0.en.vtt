00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:17.277
I'm going to tell you a little bit
about my TEDxHouston Talk.

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.214
I woke up the morning
after I gave that talk

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:25.562
with the worst vulnerability
hangover of my life.

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:30.441
And I actually didn't leave my house
for about three days.

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.319
The first time I left
was to meet a friend for lunch.

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:38.209
And when I walked in,
she was already at the table.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.726
I sat down, and she said,
"God, you look like hell."

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.516
I said, "Thanks. I feel really --

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.128
I'm not functioning."

00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:48.326
And she said, "What's going on?"

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.943
And I said, "I just told 500 people

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:56.976
that I became a researcher
to avoid vulnerability.

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:02.042
And that when being vulnerable
emerged from my data,

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.645
as absolutely essential
to whole-hearted living,

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:09.976
I told these 500 people
that I had a breakdown.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.478
I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.976
At what point did I think
that was a good idea?"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.121
(Laughter)

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.303
And she said, "I saw
your talk live-streamed.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:22.619
It was not really you.

00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:25.025
It was a little different
than what you usually do.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.092
But it was great."

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:28.377
And I said,

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:29.976
"This can't happen.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.741
YouTube, they're putting
this thing on YouTube.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.373
And we're going to be talking
about 600, 700 people."

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:40.722
(Laughter)

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:43.873
And she said,
"Well, I think it's too late."

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:46.177
And I said, "Let me ask you something."

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.653
And she said, "Yeah."

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.970
I said, "Do you remember
when we were in college,

00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:52.035
really wild and kind of dumb?"

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:53.065
She said, "Yeah."

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:55.715
I said, "Remember when
we'd leave a really bad message

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.715
on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?

00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:01.745
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
and then erase the tape?"

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.166
(Laughter)

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.896
And she goes, "Uh... no."

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.130
(Laughter)

00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:11.780
Of course, the only thing
I could say at that point was,

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:13.188
"Yeah, me neither.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.825
Yeah -- me neither."

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.166
And I'm thinking to myself,

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:21.976
"BrenÃ©, what are you doing?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.225
Why did you bring this up?

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.850
Have you lost your mind?

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:28.159
Your sisters would be perfect for this."

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:29.588
(Laughter)

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.742
So I looked back up and she said,

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:37.520
"Are you really going to try
to break in and steal the video

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:39.120
before they put it on YouTube?"

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:40.632
(Laughter)

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:43.616
And I said, "I'm just thinking
about it a little bit."

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.402
(Laughter)

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:49.979
She said, "You're like the worst
vulnerability role model ever."

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.976
(Laughter)

00:02:52.937 --> 00:02:54.905
Then I looked at her and I said something

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.857
that at the time felt a little dramatic,

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.293
but ended up being
more prophetic than dramatic.

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:04.738
"If 500 turns into 1,000

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.222
or 2,000,

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:07.976
my life is over."

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.832
(Laughter)

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.317
I had no contingency plan
for four million.

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:16.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:20.271
And my life did end when that happened.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:23.976
And maybe the hardest part
about my life ending

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.947
is that I learned something
hard about myself,

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.415
and that was that,

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.976
as much as I would be frustrated

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.524
about not being able to get
my work out to the world,

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.976
there was a part of me
that was working very hard

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.536
to engineer staying small,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.386
staying right under the radar.

00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.894
But I want to talk
about what I've learned.

00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:50.721
There's two things
that I've learned in the last year.

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:52.465
The first is:

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:57.747
vulnerability is not weakness.

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:03.481
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:06.005
Let me ask you honestly --

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.837
and I'll give you this warning,

00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:09.147
I'm trained as a therapist,

00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:11.976
so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.445
so if you could just raise your hand
that would be awesome --

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:16.976
how many of you honestly,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.834
when you're thinking about doing
or saying something vulnerable

00:04:20.858 --> 00:04:23.287
think, "God, vulnerability is weakness."

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:26.359
How many of you think of vulnerability
and weakness synonymously?

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.581
The majority of people.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.751
Now let me ask you this question:

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:33.350
This past week at TED,

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:35.976
how many of you,
when you saw vulnerability up here,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.708
thought it was pure courage?

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:42.628
Vulnerability is not weakness.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.210
I define vulnerability as emotional risk,

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:50.512
exposure, uncertainty.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.242
It fuels our daily lives.

00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:55.159
And I've come to the belief --

00:04:55.183 --> 00:04:57.428
this is my 12th year
doing this research --

00:04:57.452 --> 00:05:03.954
that vulnerability is our most accurate
measurement of courage --

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:08.437
to be vulnerable,
to let ourselves be seen,

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:09.532
to be honest.

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:14.318
One of the weird things that's happened
is, after the TED explosion,

00:05:14.342 --> 00:05:17.975
I got a lot of offers to speak
all over the country --

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.361
everyone from schools and parent meetings

00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:22.337
to Fortune 500 companies.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.417
And so many of the calls went like this,

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:27.191
"Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk.

00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.076
We'd like you to come in and speak.

00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:30.976
We'd appreciate it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.332
if you wouldn't mention
vulnerability or shame."

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:37.970
(Laughter)

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:40.843
What would you like for me to talk about?

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.493
There's three big answers.

00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:46.643
This is mostly, to be honest with you,
from the business sector:

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:50.045
innovation, creativity and change.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:52.490
(Laughter)

00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:56.434
So let me go on the record and say,

00:05:56.458 --> 00:06:01.628
vulnerability is the birthplace
of innovation, creativity and change.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:07.191
(Applause)

00:06:09.855 --> 00:06:14.045
To create is to make something
that has never existed before.

00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:17.976
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.976
Adaptability to change
is all about vulnerability.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.555
The second thing,

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:28.385
in addition to really
finally understanding

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.812
the relationship between
vulnerability and courage,

00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:32.701
the second thing I learned, is this:

00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:36.000
We have to talk about shame.

00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:40.793
And I'm going to be
really honest with you.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.341
When I became a "vulnerability researcher"

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:47.100
and that became the focus
because of the TED talk --

00:06:47.124 --> 00:06:48.521
and I'm not kidding.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.108
I'll give you an example.

00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:54.045
About three months ago,
I was in a sporting goods store

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.498
buying goggles and shin guards

00:06:55.522 --> 00:06:59.097
and all the things that parents buy
at the sporting goods store.

00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:01.970
About from a hundred feet away,
this is what I hear:

00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:04.625
"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.505
(Laughter)

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:11.546
(Laughter ends)

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.645
I'm a fifth-generation Texan.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.224
Our family motto is "Lock and load."

00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:20.883
I am not a natural
vulnerability researcher.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.976
So I'm like,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.954
just keep walking, she's on my six.

00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:28.398
(Laughter)

00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:31.557
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:35.231
I turn around, I go, "Hi."

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.885
She's right here and she said,

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.695
"You're the shame researcher
who had the breakdown."

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:44.533
(Laughter)

00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:49.279
At this point, parents are, like,
pulling their children close.

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:50.403
(Laughter)

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.771
"Look away."

00:07:54.612 --> 00:07:56.968
And I'm so worn out
at this point in my life,

00:07:56.992 --> 00:07:58.703
I look at her and I actually say,

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:01.361
"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:02.976
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.321
(Applause)

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:08.202
And she looks back and does this,

00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:09.250
"I know."

00:08:09.274 --> 00:08:10.275
(Laughter)

00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.090
And she said,

00:08:12.114 --> 00:08:14.465
"We watched your TED talk in my book club.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:18.465
Then we read your book
and we renamed ourselves

00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:20.466
'The Breakdown Babes.'"

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.729
(Laughter)

00:08:21.753 --> 00:08:23.765
And she said, "Our tagline is:

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:26.976
'We're falling apart
and it feels fantastic.'"

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.829
(Laughter)

00:08:30.853 --> 00:08:34.266
You can only imagine what it's like
for me in a faculty meeting.

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:35.925
(Sighs)

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:40.335
So when I became Vulnerability TED,

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:41.708
like an action figure --

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:46.914
Like Ninja Barbie,
but I'm Vulnerability TED --

00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:49.617
I thought, I'm going to leave
that shame stuff behind,

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:52.585
because I spent six years studying shame

00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:55.450
before I started writing
and talking about vulnerability.

00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:58.542
And I thought, thank God,
because shame is this horrible topic,

00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.132
no one wants to talk about it.

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:02.634
It's the best way to shut
people down on an airplane.

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:04.597
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."

00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:06.844
(Laughter)

00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:07.976
And I see you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.976
(Laughter)

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:18.254
But in surviving this last year,

00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:20.929
I was reminded of a cardinal rule --

00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:22.976
not a research rule,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.225
but a moral imperative
from my upbringing --

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:30.424
"you've got to dance
with the one who brung ya".

00:09:31.329 --> 00:09:33.803
And I did not learn about vulnerability

00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:36.894
and courage and creativity and innovation

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:39.720
from studying vulnerability.

00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:42.506
I learned about these things
from studying shame.

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:46.693
And so I want to walk you in to shame.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.975
Jungian analysts call shame
the swampland of the soul.

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:55.076
And we're going to walk in.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.976
And the purpose is not to walk in

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.306
and construct a home and live there.

00:10:00.124 --> 00:10:03.824
It is to put on some galoshes --

00:10:03.848 --> 00:10:06.427
and walk through and find our way around.

00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:10.181
Here's why.

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:17.593
We heard the most compelling call ever
to have a conversation in this country,

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.229
and I think globally, around race, right?

00:10:22.184 --> 00:10:23.672
Yes? We heard that.

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:24.696
Yes?

00:10:25.347 --> 00:10:28.767
Cannot have that conversation
without shame.

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:32.257
Because you cannot talk about race
without talking about privilege.

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.424
And when people start
talking about privilege,

00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:35.847
they get paralyzed by shame.

00:10:36.812 --> 00:10:40.962
We heard a brilliant simple solution
to not killing people in surgery,

00:10:40.986 --> 00:10:42.280
which is, have a checklist.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.982
You can't fix that problem
without addressing shame,

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:48.976
because when they teach
those folks how to suture,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.356
they also teach them
how to stitch their self-worth

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.753
to being all-powerful.

00:10:54.507 --> 00:10:57.189
And all-powerful folks
don't need checklists.

00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:01.958
And I had to write down
the name of this TED Fellow

00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:03.505
so I didn't mess it up here.

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:06.021
Myshkin Ingawale,

00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:07.783
I hope I did right by you.

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:10.895
(Applause)

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:12.851
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:16.241
And he got up and he explained
how he was driven to create

00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:18.439
some technology to help test for anemia,

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:20.686
because people were dying unnecessarily.

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:22.905
And he said, "I saw this need.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:24.596
So you know what I did? I made it."

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.175
And everybody just burst into applause,
and they were like "Yes!"

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:29.894
And he said, "And it didn't work.

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:31.047
(Laughter)

00:11:31.071 --> 00:11:34.802
And then I made it 32 more times,

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:35.976
and then it worked."

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:39.009
You know what the big secret about TED is?

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:40.606
I can't wait to tell people this.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.324
I guess I'm doing it right now.

00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:44.452
(Laughter)

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.499
This is like the failure conference.

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:47.777
(Laughter)

00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:48.946
No, it is.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.729
(Applause)

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.579
You know why this place is amazing?

00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:57.722
Because very few people here
are afraid to fail.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:02.903
And no one who gets on the stage,
so far that I've seen, has not failed.

00:12:02.927 --> 00:12:05.744
I've failed miserably, many times.

00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:08.355
I don't think the world understands that,

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:09.821
because of shame.

00:12:10.718 --> 00:12:13.077
There's a great quote
that saved me this past year

00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:14.494
by Theodore Roosevelt.

00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:17.580
A lot of people refer to it
as the "Man in the Arena" quote.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:19.976
And it goes like this:

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.057
"It is not the critic who counts.

00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.406
It is not the man who sits and points out

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.909
how the doer of deeds
could have done things better

00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:29.924
and how he falls and stumbles.

00:12:29.948 --> 00:12:33.015
The credit goes to the man in the arena

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:37.230
whose face is marred
with dust and blood and sweat.

00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:41.276
But when he's in the arena,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.466
at best, he wins,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.350
and at worst, he loses,

00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:47.619
but when he fails, when he loses,

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.373
he does so daring greatly."

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.849
And that's what this conference,
to me, is about.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:57.436
Life is about daring greatly,
about being in the arena.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.509
When you walk up to that arena
and you put your hand on the door,

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:03.184
and you think, "I'm going in
and I'm going to try this,"

00:13:03.208 --> 00:13:04.583
shame is the gremlin

00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:06.829
who says, "Uh, uh.

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:08.101
You're not good enough.

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.472
You never finished that MBA.
Your wife left you.

00:13:11.948 --> 00:13:13.996
I know your dad really
wasn't in Luxembourg,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.326
he was in Sing Sing.

00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:20.094
I know those things
that happened to you growing up.

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:22.447
I know you don't think

00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:25.328
that you're pretty, smart,
talented or powerful enough.

00:13:25.352 --> 00:13:28.757
I know your dad never paid attention,
even when you made CFO."

00:13:29.884 --> 00:13:31.273
Shame is that thing.

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:35.837
And if we can quiet it down and walk in

00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.671
and say, "I'm going to do this,"

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:42.976
we look up and the critic
that we see pointing and laughing,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.350
99 percent of the time is who?

00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:47.694
Us.

00:13:49.302 --> 00:13:50.976
Shame drives two big tapes --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.243
"never good enough" --

00:13:53.846 --> 00:13:55.949
and, if you can talk it out of that one,

00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:57.675
"who do you think you are?"

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.123
The thing to understand
about shame is, it's not guilt.

00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:04.958
Shame is a focus on self,
guilt is a focus on behavior.

00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:06.663
Shame is "I am bad."

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:08.479
Guilt is "I did something bad."

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:10.976
How many of you,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.235
if you did something
that was hurtful to me,

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:16.100
would be willing to say,
"I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"

00:14:16.124 --> 00:14:18.220
How many of you would be
willing to say that?

00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:20.976
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

00:14:21.387 --> 00:14:24.546
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.

00:14:25.387 --> 00:14:27.950
There's a huge difference
between shame and guilt.

00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:29.546
And here's what you need to know.

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.410
Shame is highly, highly correlated

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:35.661
with addiction, depression,
violence, aggression,

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:38.335
bullying, suicide, eating disorders.

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:41.580
And here's what you even
need to know more.

00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:44.846
Guilt, inversely correlated
with those things.

00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:50.059
The ability to hold something
we've done or failed to do

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:53.471
up against who we want to be
is incredibly adaptive.

00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:55.861
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.547
The other thing you need
to know about shame

00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:04.190
is it's absolutely organized by gender.

00:15:05.214 --> 00:15:08.036
If shame washes over me
and washes over Chris,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.648
it's going to feel the same.

00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:12.976
Everyone sitting in here knows
the warm wash of shame.

00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:16.601
We're pretty sure that the only people
who don't experience shame

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:19.443
are people who have no capacity
for connection or empathy.

00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:22.030
Which means, yes, I have a little shame;

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.546
no, I'm a sociopath.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.000
So I would opt for, yes,
you have a little shame.

00:15:29.574 --> 00:15:31.589
Shame feels the same for men and women,

00:15:31.613 --> 00:15:33.074
but it's organized by gender.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:36.176
For women,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.505
the best example I can give you
is Enjoli, the commercial.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.196
"I can put the wash on the line,
pack the lunches, hand out the kisses

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.299
and be at work at five to nine.

00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:50.349
I can bring home the bacon,
fry it up in the pan

00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:52.298
and never let you forget you're a man."

00:15:53.483 --> 00:15:55.971
For women, shame is, do it all,

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:57.087
do it perfectly

00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.042
and never let them see you sweat.

00:16:00.504 --> 00:16:02.976
I don't know how much perfume
that commercial sold,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.656
but I guarantee you,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.667
it moved a lot of antidepressants
and anti-anxiety meds.

00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:10.855
(Laughter)

00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:14.352
Shame, for women, is this web

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:18.244
of unobtainable, conflicting,
competing expectations

00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:19.912
about who we're supposed to be.

00:16:21.506 --> 00:16:23.071
And it's a straight-jacket.

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:24.976
For men,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.425
shame is not a bunch of competing,
conflicting expectations.

00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:30.134
Shame is one,

00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:31.771
do not be perceived as what?

00:16:33.213 --> 00:16:34.245
Weak.

00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:38.418
I did not interview men
for the first four years of my study.

00:16:38.442 --> 00:16:41.700
It wasn't until a man looked at me
after a book signing, and said,

00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:43.252
"I love what say about shame,

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:45.229
I'm curious why you didn't mention men."

00:16:45.253 --> 00:16:47.234
And I said, "I don't study men."

00:16:47.258 --> 00:16:48.976
And he said, "That's convenient."

00:16:50.313 --> 00:16:53.280
(Laughter)

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:54.447
And I said, "Why?"

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.302
And he said, "Because
you say to reach out,

00:16:57.326 --> 00:16:59.693
tell our story,

00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:00.876
be vulnerable.

00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:05.976
But you see those books you just signed
for my wife and my three daughters?"

00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:08.146
I said, "Yeah."

00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:11.281
"They'd rather me die
on top of my white horse

00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:12.698
than watch me fall down.

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.976
When we reach out and be vulnerable,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.707
we get the shit beat out of us.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.608
And don't tell me

00:17:21.632 --> 00:17:24.249
it's from the guys
and the coaches and the dads.

00:17:26.033 --> 00:17:29.124
Because the women in my life
are harder on me than anyone else."

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.002
So I started interviewing men
and asking questions.

00:17:33.864 --> 00:17:35.645
And what I learned is this:

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:38.947
You show me a woman
who can actually sit with a man

00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:41.007
in real vulnerability and fear,

00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.634
I'll show you a woman
who's done incredible work.

00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:46.849
You show me a man who can sit with a woman

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:48.656
who's just had it,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.132
she can't do it all anymore,

00:17:52.156 --> 00:17:54.005
and his first response is not,

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:55.976
"I unloaded the dishwasher!"

00:17:56.497 --> 00:17:57.512
(Laughter)

00:17:57.536 --> 00:17:59.497
But he really listens --

00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:00.976
because that's all we need --

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.143
I'll show you a guy
who's done a lot of work.

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.792
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:11.106
And to get out from underneath it --

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.773
to find our way back to each other,

00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.678
we have to understand how it affects us

00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:20.405
and how it affects
the way we're parenting,

00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:23.286
the way we're working,
the way we're looking at each other.

00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:27.875
Very quickly, some research
by Mahalik at Boston College.

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:31.600
He asked, what do women need to do
to conform to female norms?

00:18:31.624 --> 00:18:33.730
The top answers in this country:

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.976
nice, thin, modest

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.242
and use all available
resources for appearance.

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:41.059
(Laughter)

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.396
When he asked about men,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.848
what do men in this country need to do
to conform with male norms,

00:18:46.872 --> 00:18:48.429
the answers were:

00:18:48.453 --> 00:18:50.469
always show emotional control,

00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:52.047
work is first,

00:18:52.071 --> 00:18:54.327
pursue status and violence.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.853
If we're going to find
our way back to each other,

00:18:57.877 --> 00:18:59.976
we have to understand and know empathy,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.976
because empathy's the antidote to shame.

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.912
If you put shame in a Petri dish,

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:07.245
it needs three things
to grow exponentially:

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:08.976
secrecy, silence and judgment.

00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:12.915
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish
and douse it with empathy,

00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:14.319
it can't survive.

00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:17.651
The two most powerful words
when we're in struggle:

00:19:17.675 --> 00:19:18.699
me too.

00:19:19.707 --> 00:19:21.842
And so I'll leave you with this thought.

00:19:23.008 --> 00:19:27.390
If we're going to find our way
back to each other,

00:19:27.414 --> 00:19:30.184
vulnerability is going to be that path.

00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:33.914
And I know it's seductive
to stand outside the arena,

00:19:33.938 --> 00:19:35.799
because I think I did it my whole life,

00:19:35.823 --> 00:19:37.076
and think to myself,

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.563
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass

00:19:39.587 --> 00:19:42.023
when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.

00:19:44.102 --> 00:19:45.412
And that is seductive.

00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:48.155
But the truth is, that never happens.

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:51.017
And even if you got
as perfect as you could

00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:53.629
and as bulletproof as you
could possibly muster

00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:54.748
when you got in there,

00:19:54.772 --> 00:19:56.272
that's not what we want to see.

00:19:58.743 --> 00:20:00.307
We want you to go in.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.036
We want to be with you
and across from you.

00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:06.808
And we just want,

00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:09.208
for ourselves and the people we care about

00:20:09.232 --> 00:20:11.058
and the people we work with,

00:20:11.082 --> 00:20:12.439
to dare greatly.

00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:14.976
So thank you all very much.
I really appreciate it.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.295
(Applause)
