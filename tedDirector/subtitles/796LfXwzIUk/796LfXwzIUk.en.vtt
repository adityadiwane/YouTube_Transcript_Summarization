00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to talk to you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about power in this 21st century.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
And basically, what I'd like to tell you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
is that power is changing,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and there are two types of changes

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I want to discuss.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
One is power transition,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
which is change of power amongst states.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
And there the simple version of the message

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is it's moving from West to East.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
The other is power diffusion,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
the way power is moving

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
from all states West or East

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
to non-state actors.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Those two things

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
are the huge shifts of power

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in our century.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
And I want to tell you about them each separately

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and then how they interact

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and why, in the end, there may be some good news.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
When we talk about power transition,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
we often talk about the rise of Asia.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
It really should be called

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
the recovery or return of Asia.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
If we looked at the world

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
in 1800,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
you'd find that more than half of the world's people

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
lived in Asia

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and they made more than half the world's product.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Now fast forward to 1900:

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but they're now making

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
only a fifth of the world's product.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
What happened? The Industrial Revolution,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which meant that all of a sudden,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Europe and America

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
became the dominant center of the world.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
What we're going to see in the 21st century

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
is Asia gradually returning

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
to being more than half of the world's population

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and more than half of the world's product.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
That's important and it's an important shift.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
But let me tell you a little bit about

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
the other shift that I'm talking about,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
which is power diffusion.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
To understand power diffusion

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
put this in your mind:

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
computing and communications costs

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
have fallen a thousandfold

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
between 1970

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and the beginning of this century.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Now that's a big abstract number.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
But to make it more real,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
if the price of an automobile

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
had fallen as rapidly

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
as the price of computing power,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
you could buy a car today

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
for five dollars.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Now when the price of any technology

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
declines that dramatically,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the barriers to entry go down.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Anybody can play in the game.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
So in 1970,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
if you wanted to communicate

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
from Oxford to Johannesburg

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
to New Delhi

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to Brasilia

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and anywhere simultaneously,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
you could do it.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
The technology was there.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
But to be able to do it,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
you had to be very rich --

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
a government, a multinational corporation,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
maybe the Catholic Church --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
but you had to be pretty wealthy.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Now, anybody has that capacity,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
which previously was restricted by price

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
just to a few actors.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and if you have Skype, it's free.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
So capabilities

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
that were once restricted

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
are now available to everyone.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And what that means

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
is not that the age of the State is over.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
The State still matters.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But the stage is crowded.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Some of that's good:

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Oxfam,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
a great non-governmental actor.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Some of it's bad:

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
But think of what it does

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
We think in terms of war

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and interstate war.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And you can think back to 1941

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
when the government of Japan

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It's worth noticing

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that a non-state actor

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
attacking the United States in 2001

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
killed more Americans

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
than the government of Japan did in 1941.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
You might think of that

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
as the privatization of war.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So we're seeing a great change

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in terms of diffusion of power.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
Now the problem is

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
So let me step back

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and ask: what's power?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Power is simple the ability

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
to affect others

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
to get the outcomes you want,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and you can do it in three ways.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
You can do it with threats

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
of coercion, "sticks,"

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
you can do it with payments,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
"carrots,"

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
or you can do it by getting others

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
to want what you want.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And that ability to get others to want what you want,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to get the outcomes you want

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
without coercion or payment,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
is what I call soft power.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And that soft power has been much neglected

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and much misunderstood,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and yet it's tremendously important.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Indeed, if you can learn

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to use more soft power,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
you can save a lot

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
on carrots and sticks.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Traditionally, the way people thought about power

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
was primarily in terms of military power.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
For example, the great Oxford historian

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
defined a great power

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
as a country able to prevail in war.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But we need a new narrative

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
if we're to understand power in the 21st century.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
It's not just prevailing at war,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
though war still persists.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
It's not whose army wins;

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
it's also whose story wins.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and whose narrative is going to be effective.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Now let me go back

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
to the question

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
of power transition

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
between states

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and what's happening there.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
the narratives that we use now

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
tend to be the rise and fall

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of the great powers.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And the current narrative is all about

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
the rise of China

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and the decline of the United States.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
many people said this was

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the beginning of the end of American power.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
The tectonic plates

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
of world politics were shifting.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
pronounced in 2008

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
this was the beginning of the end

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
of United States power.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
But in fact,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
this metaphor of decline

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is often very misleading.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
If you look at history, in recent history,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
you'll see the cycles of belief

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
in American decline

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
In 1958,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
after the Soviets put up Sputnik,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
it was "That's the end of America."

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
In 1973, with the oil embargo

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and the closing of the gold window,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
that was the end of America.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
In the 1980s,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
between the rust belt economy of the midwest

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
to the Silicon Valley economy of California,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
that was the end of America.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
But in fact, what we've seen

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
is none of those were true.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
in the early 2000s,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
thinking America could do anything,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
which led us into some disastrous

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
foreign policy adventures,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
and now we're back to decline again.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
The moral of this story

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
tell us a lot more about psychology

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
than they do about reality.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
If we try to focus on the reality,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
then what we need to focus on

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
is what's really happening

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
in terms of China and the United States.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
Goldman Sachs has projected

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
that China, the Chinese economy,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
will surpass that of the U.S.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
by 2027.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
So we've got, what,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
17 more years to go or so

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
before China's bigger.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Now someday,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
with a billion point three people getting richer,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
they are going to be bigger than the United States.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
But be very careful about these projections

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
such as the Goldman Sachs projection

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
as though that gives you an accurate picture

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of power transition in this century.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
First of all, it's a linear projection.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
You know, everything says,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
here it goes -- straight line.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
History is not linear.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
The second thing is

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
that the Chinese economy

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
which it may it,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
that will be a measure of total economic size,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but not of per capita income --

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
won't tell you about the composition of the economy.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
China still has large areas

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
of underdevelopment

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
and per capita income is a better measure

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
of the sophistication of the economy.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
until somewhere in the latter part,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
after 2050, of this century.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
The other point that's worth noticing

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
is how one-dimensional

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
this projection is.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
You know, it looks at economic power

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
measured by GDP.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Doesn't tell you much about military power,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
doesn't tell you very much about soft power.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
It's all very one-dimensional.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
or return of Asia

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
as I called it a little bit earlier,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
If you're sitting in Japan,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
or in New Delhi,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
or in Hanoi,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
your view of the rise of China

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Indeed, one of the advantages

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that the Americans will have

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
in terms of power in Asia

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
is all those countries

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
want an American insurance policy

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
against the rise of China.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
It's as though Mexico and Canada

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
were hostile neighbors to the United States,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
which they're not.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
So these simple projections

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
of the Goldman Sachs type

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
are not telling us what we need to know

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.260
about power transition.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
But you might ask, well so what in any case?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Why does it matter? Who cares?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Is this just a game

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
that diplomats and academics play?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
The answer is it matters quite a lot.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Because, if you believe in decline

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and you get the answers wrong on this,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
the facts, not the myths,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
you may have policies which are very dangerous.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
Let me give you an example from history.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
The Peloponnesian War

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
was the great conflict

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
in which the Greek city state system

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
tore itself apart

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
two and a half millennia ago.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
What caused it?

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
said it was the rise in the power of Athens

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and the fear it created in Sparta.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Notice both halves of that explanation.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Many people argue

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
that the 21st century

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
is going to repeat the 20th century,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
in which World War One,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
the great conflagration

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in which the European state system

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
tore itself apart

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and destroyed its centrality in the world,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
that that was caused by

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
the rise in the power of Germany

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and the fear it created in Britain.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
So there are people who are telling us

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
this is going to be reproduced today,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
that what we're going to see

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
is the same thing now in this century.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
No, I think that's wrong.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
It's bad history.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
in industrial strength by 1900.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And as I said earlier,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
China has not passed the United States.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
But also, if you have this belief

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
and it creates a sense of fear,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
it leads to overreaction.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And the greatest danger we have

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
of managing this power transition

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
of the shift toward the East is fear.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
from a different context,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
We don't have to fear the rise of China

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
or the return of Asia.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And if we have policies

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
in which we take it

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
in that larger historical perspective,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
we're going to be able

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
to manage this process.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Let me say a word now

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
about the distribution of power

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
and how it relates to power diffusion

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and then pull these two types together.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
it's distributed much like

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
a three-dimensional chess game.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
Top board:

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
military power among states.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
The United States is the only superpower,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
and it's likely to remain that way

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
for two or three decades.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
economic power among states.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Power is multi-polar.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
There are balancers --

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
the U.S., Europe,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
China, Japan

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
can balance each other.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
The bottom board of this three-dimensional,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
the board of transnational relations,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
things that cross borders outside the control of governments,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
things like climate change, drug trade,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
financial flows,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
pandemics,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
all these things that cross borders

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
outside the control of governments,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
there nobody's in charge.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
It makes no sense to call this unipolar

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
or multi-polar.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Power is chaotically distributed.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And the only way you can solve these problems --

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
and this is where many greatest challenges

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
are coming in this century --

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
is through cooperation,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
through working together,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
which means that soft power becomes more important,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
that ability to organize networks

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
to deal with these kinds of problems

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and to be able to get cooperation.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Another way of putting it

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
is that as we think of power in the 21st century,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
we want to get away from the idea

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
that power's always zero sum --

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
my gain is your loss and vice versa.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Power can also be positive sum,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
where your gain can be my gain.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
If China develops greater energy security

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and greater capacity

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
that's good for us

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
as well as good for China

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
as well as good for everybody else.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
So empowering China

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
to deal with its own problems of carbon

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
is good for everybody,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
It's one in which we can all gain.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
So as we think about power

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
in this century,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
we want to get away from this view

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
that it's all I win, you lose.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Wars persist. Power persists.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
Military power is important.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
Keeping balances is important.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
All this still persists.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Hard power is there,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
and it will remain.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
But unless you learn how to mix

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
hard power with soft power

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
into strategies that I call smart power,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
that we're facing.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
is how do we work together

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
to produce global public goods,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
things from which all of us can benefit?

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
How do we define our national interests

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
so that it's not just zero sum,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
but positive sum.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
In that sense, if we define our interests,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
for example, for the United States

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.260
keeping an open trading system,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
those were good for Britain,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
they were good for others as well.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
How do we produce global public goods,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
which are good for us,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
but good for everyone at the same time?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And that's going to be the good news dimension

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
of what we need to think about

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
as we think of power in the 21st century.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
There are ways to define our interests

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
we can organize with others in networks

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
to produce, not only public goods,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
but ways that will enhance our soft power.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
So if one looks at the statements

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that have been made about this,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
described the foreign policy

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
of the Obama administration,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
was going to be smart power,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
as she put it, "using all the tools

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
in our foreign policy tool box."

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
And if we're going to deal

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
with these two great power shifts that I've described,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
the power shift represented by transition among states,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
the power shift represented

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
by diffusion of power away from all states,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
in which we combine hard and soft power

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
into strategies of smart power.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
And that's the good news I have. We can do that.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.260
