00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from when I was 12 years old.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
at least I thought it was beautiful.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I wore it whenever I could,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Until one day in ninth grade,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
when I was standing with a number of the football players.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
said in a booming voice that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I was so humiliated and mortified

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
somewhat ceremoniously,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
nor see it ever again.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
running toward me, wearing my sweater.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
scaring the living bejesus out of him --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
written on the collar of this sweater.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that we all have on this Earth.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
does to people we think we will never see and never know.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
of what aid is and can be.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and moved its way into the larger industry,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it destroyed the local retailing industry.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Not to say that it shouldn't have,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but that we have to get better at answering the questions

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that need to be considered when we think about consequences

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and responses.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
where I was doing two things.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but then it was quite new, especially in an economy

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that was moving from barter into trade.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We got a lot of things right.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
as to how they would use this access to credit

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to build their little businesses, earn more income

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
so they could take care of their families better.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The genocide happened in 1994,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
seven years after these women all worked together

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to build this dream.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the good news was that the institution,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the banking institution, lasted.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The bakery was completely wiped out,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but the lessons for me were that accountability counts --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
got to build things with people on the ground,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the incentives matter.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that was happening in the world,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the world is talking about Africa

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in ways I have never seen in my life.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's thrilling.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that is all about execution, all about the how-to.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is to build viable systems on the ground

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
If we do that, we really can make poverty history.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it was that -- that whole philosophy --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that encouraged me to start my current endeavor

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
called "Acumen Fund,"

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which is trying to build some mini-blueprints

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
for how we might do that in water, health and housing

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
so you can see what it is that we're doing.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Because we too often talk about them as these

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and yet most of these people go invisible.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Where we typically work, there's people making between

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
one and three dollars a day.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Who are these people?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
They are farmers and factory workers.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They work in government offices. They're drivers.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They are domestics.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
what their middleclass counterparts pay --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
if you give them that opportunity.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So, two examples.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
most of whom make less than two dollars a day.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
A couple of principles:

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
build small.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with a corrugated iron roof.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
A couple of years later, I meet them.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to build their house.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Something I truly believe.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
huge kudos for bringing to the world

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
300 to 500 million cases are reported.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's estimated that Africa loses

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Five dollars can save a life.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The question, though, is not "Why can't we?"

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
A lot of hurdles.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
so that they could transfer technology from Japan

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Here are just some pictures of the factory.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Today, three years later, the company has employed

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
another thousand women.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's the largest company in Tanzania.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
three million by the end of the year.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So the production side is working.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
On the distribution side, though,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
as a world, we have a lot of work to do.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and then given primarily to people around Africa.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
We're looking at building

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Their women.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And so I want you to meet Jacqueline,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
my namesake, 21 years old.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
to put a down payment on her house.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and told me she is not marrying nor having children

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
until these things are completed.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And so, when I told her about our idea --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and find a way for the women themselves to go out

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and sell these nets to others --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
she quickly started calculating what she herself could make

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and signed up.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and quickly did a prototyping on this,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and we learned a lot about how you sell things.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Not coming in with our own notions,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Children can sleep through the night;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And we've started making curtains,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that you care about your children.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
goods and services to the poor.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to make poverty history.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
people all over the developing world

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
who fit in this category, to do it themselves.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that they want to make their own decisions;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
they want to solve their own problems;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and that by engaging with them,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
not only do we create much more dignity for them,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but for us as well.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And so I urge all of you to think next time

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that we all have -- to make poverty history --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by really becoming part of the process

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and moving away from an us-and-them world,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and realizing that it's about all of us,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Thank you.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
(Applause)
