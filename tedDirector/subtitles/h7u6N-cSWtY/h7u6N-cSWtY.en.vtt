00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
with a hyena.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
AK: The ancestor of the horse.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Okay, we'll do something with it.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
(Laughter)

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Hahahaha.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
because it was part of a production

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
called "Faustus in Africa,"

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
a Handspring Production from 1995,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
This production was directed

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
by South African artist and theater director,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
William Kentridge.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
So it needed a very articulate front paw.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
BJ: One of them is breath,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and it kind of breathes.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.260
AK: Haa haa haaa.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
BJ: Breath is really important for us.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
It's the kind of original movement

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
for any puppet for us onstage.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
AK: Oops.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
BJ: From an actor.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Puppets always have to try to be alive.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's their kind of ur-story onstage,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
that desperation to live.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and it only lives

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because you make it.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
An actor struggles to die onstage,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
but a puppet has to struggle to live.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So we call this

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
a piece of emotional engineering

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
that uses up-to-the-minute

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
17th century technology --

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
(Laughter)

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
to turn nouns

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
into verbs.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
AK: Well actually I prefer to say

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
that it's an object

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
constructed out of wood and cloth

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
with movement built into it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
to persuade you to believe that it has life.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
BJ: Okay so.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
AK: It has ears that move passively

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
when the head goes.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
BJ: And it has these bulkheads

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
made out of plywood,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
covered with fabric --

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
curiously similar, in fact,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to the plywood canoes

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that Adrian's father used to make

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
when he was a boy in their workshop.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And when we met at art school

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and fell in love

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
in 1971,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
I hated puppets.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I really thought they were so beneath me.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And, in fact, it took about 10 years

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to discover

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to learn a renewed, or a new, respect

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
for this art form.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
to form a puppet company.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And 20 years later, miraculously,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
we collaborated with a company from Mali,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.260
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
but it's ultimately the same structure.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
It's got two people inside it on stilts,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
which give them the height,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and somebody in the front

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
AK: The person in the hind legs

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
same mechanism, just a bit bigger.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And he's controlling the ear movement.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
BJ: So this production

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
was seen by Tom Morris

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of the National Theatre in London.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And just around that time,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
his mother had said,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
called 'War Horse'?"

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
The horse is sold to the First World War,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and he joins up to find his horse.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
"Do you think you could make us a horse

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
AK: It had to have a rider,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and it had to participate in cavalry charges.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
(Laughter)

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
A play about early 20th century plowing technology

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and cavalry charges

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
at the National Theatre in London.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
So we began with a test.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.260
who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and our next-door neighbor Katherine,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
riding on a ladder.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
AK: And once we put Katherine

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
through that particular brand of hell,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So we made a model.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
This is a cardboard model,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
a little bit smaller than the hyena.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and the canoe structure is still there.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
But we didn't realize at the time

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that we actually needed a third manipulator,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
because we couldn't manipulate the neck

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
from inside

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and walk the horse at the same time.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
AK: We started work on the prototype

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
after the model was approved,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
and the prototype took a bit longer

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
than we anticipated.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And we had a crate built for it.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It had to be shipped to London.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
BJ: So we got a camera,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
and we posed the puppet

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.260
in various galloping stances.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And we sent it off

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to the National Theatre,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
hoping that they believed

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
that we created something that worked.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
(Laughter)

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
AK: A month later, we were there in London

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
BJ: About 40 people.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
AK: We were terrified.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
We opened the lid, we took the horse out,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Here I have an 18-second clip

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
of the very first walk of the prototype.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
This is in the National Theatre studio,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
the place where they cook new ideas.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
It had by no means got the green light yet.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
invented a beautiful sequence

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
where the baby horse,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
grew up into the big horse.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And so the show was given the green light.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Here is the plan.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Laughter)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
And here is our factory in Cape Town

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
where we make horses.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
The horses are completely handmade.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
There is very little 20th century technology in them.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
and some of the aluminum pieces.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
But because they have to be light and flexible,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
and each one of them is different,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So here are some half-finished horses

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
ready to be worked in London.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And now we would like to introduce you

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
to Joey.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Joey boy, you there?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Joey.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
(Applause)

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:38.260
(Applause)

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Joey.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
Joey, come here.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
No, no, I haven't got it.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
He's got it; it's in his pocket.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
BJ: Joey.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.260
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Move around. Come on.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
I'd just like to describe --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Here, Craig is working the head.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
He has bicycle brake cables

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
going down to the head control in his hand.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
Each one of them

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
operates either an ear, separately,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
or the head, up and down.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
But he also controls the head directly

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
by using his hand.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
The ears are obviously

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
a very important emotional indicator of the horse.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
When they point right back,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
the horse is fearful or angry,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and the ears listen, either side.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Horses' hearing is very important.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
It's almost more important than their eyesight.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Over here,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
Tommy's got what you call the heart position.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
He's working the leg.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
You see the string tendon from the hyena,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
the hyena's front leg,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
automatically pulls the hoop up.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.260
(Laughter)

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Horses are so unpredictable.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260
(Laughter)

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
The way a hoof comes up with a horse

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
immediately gives you the feeling

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
that it's a convincing horse action.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
The hind legs have got the same action.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
BJ: And Mikey also has,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
in his fingers,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
the ability to move the tail

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
from left to right,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and up and down with the other hand.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And together, there's quite a complex possibility

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
of tail expression.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
Adrian thought

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
and make it breathe like that --

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
But we realized

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
that, if that were to be happening,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.260
So he made a channel in here,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
and the chest moves up and down in that channel.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
but it feels like breath.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And it's very, very simple

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
because all that happens

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
AK: Other emotional stuff.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
If I were to touch the horse here

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
on his skin,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
and get the skin to quiver.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
You'll notice, of course,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
that the puppet is made out of cane lines.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
that somehow moves in space.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
But of course, it was the cane is light,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
the cane is flexible, the cane is durable

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
and the cane is moldable.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
The skin itself

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
is made out of a see-through nylon mesh,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
which, if the lighting designer

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
wants the horse to almost disappear,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
she can light the background

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
and the horse becomes ghostlike.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
You see the skeletal structure of it.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Again, that was a practical consideration.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
They have to be able to act

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
along with their fellow actors in the production.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
It's three heads making one character.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
And plant.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.260
(Whinny)

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Thank you.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And now just --

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:37.260
(Applause)

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
All the way from sunny California

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
we have Zem Joaquin

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
who's going to ride the horse for us.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.260
(Applause)

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:48.260
(Applause)

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:54.260
(Music)

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
So we would like to stress

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
that the performance you see in the horse

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
is three guys

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
while they're onstage

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
because they're mic'd.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
the whinnying and the nickering and everything --

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.260
that starts usually with one performer,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
carries on with a second person

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
and ends with a third.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:47.260
(Applause)

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
Zem Joaquin and Basil and me.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260
(Applause)

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:05.260
(Applause)
