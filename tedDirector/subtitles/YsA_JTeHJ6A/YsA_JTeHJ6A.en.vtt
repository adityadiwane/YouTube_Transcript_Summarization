00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.196
So there's this thing called
the law of unintended consequences.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.956
I thought it was just like a saying,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.556
but it actually exists, I guess.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.500
There's, like, academic papers about it.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.196
And I'm a designer.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.076
I don't like unintended consequences.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.676
People hire me because they have
consequences that they really intend,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.556
and what they intend is for me
to help them achieve those consequences.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.596
So I live in fear
of unintended consequences.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.300
And so this is a story about
consequences intended and unintended.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.036
I got called by an organization
called Robin Hood

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.636
to do a favor for them.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.076
Robin Hood is based in New York,
a wonderful philanthropic organization

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.836
that does what it says in the name.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.636
They take from rich people,
give it to poor people.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.556
In this case, what they wanted to benefit
was the New York City school system,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.916
a huge enterprise that educates
more than a million students at a time,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.276
and in buildings that are like this one,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.196
old buildings, big buildings,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.356
drafty buildings, sometimes buildings
that are in disrepair,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.916
certainly buildings
that could use a renovation.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.196
Robin Hood had this ambition
to improve these buildings in some way,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.676
but what they realized was

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.236
to fix the buildings would be
too expensive and impractical.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.636
So instead they tried to figure out
what one room they could go into

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.716
in each of these buildings,
in as many buildings that they could,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.396
and fix that one room

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.236
so that they could improve
the lives of the children inside

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.476
as they were studying.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.916
And what they came up with
was the school library,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.876
and they came up with this idea
called the Library Initiative.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.276
All the students
have to pass through the library.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.636
That's where the books are.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.996
That's where the heart
and soul of the school is.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.436
So let's fix these libraries.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.996
So they did this wonderful thing
where they brought in

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.116
first 10, then 20, then more architects,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.876
each one of whom was assigned a library
to rethink what a library was.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.956
They trained special librarians.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.036
So they started this mighty enterprise

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.076
to reform public schools
by improving these libraries.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.756
Then they called me up and they said,
"Could you make a little contribution?"

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.796
I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.676
And they said, "Well, we want you
to be the graphic designer

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.156
in charge of the whole thing."

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.756
And so I thought, I know what that means.
That means I get to design a logo.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.796
I know how to design that. I design logos.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.476
That's what people come to me for.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.596
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.876
Easy to do, actually,
compared with architecture

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.156
and being a librarian.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.916
Just do a logo, make a contribution,
and then you're out,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.876
and you feel really good about yourself.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.676
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel
good about myself when I do these favors.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.276
So I thought, let's overdeliver.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.236
I'm going to give you three logos,
all based on this one idea.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.596
So you have three options,
pick any of the three.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.916
They're all great, I said.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.156
So the basic idea was
these would be new school libraries

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.716
for New York schools,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.596
and so the idea is that it's a new thing,
a new idea that needs a new name.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.636
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea
that these were musty old libraries,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.276
the kind of places
that everyone is bored with,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.276
you know, not your grandparents' library.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.756
Don't worry about that at all.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.796
This is going to this new, exciting thing,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.076
not a boring library.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.756
So option number one:

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.796
so instead of thinking of it as a library,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.996
think of it as a place where it is like:
do talk, do make loud noises.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.036
Right? So no shushing,
it's like a shush-free zone.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.236
We're going to call it the Reading Room.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.636
That was option number one.
OK, option number two.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.076
Option number two was, wait for it,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.356
OWL.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.716
I'll meet you at OWL.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.036
I'm getting my book from the OWL.
Meet you after school down at OWL.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.396
I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.316
Well, it could be One World Library,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.956
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.476
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians
could figure out other things it could be

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.956
because they know about words.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.196
So other things, right?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.676
And then look at this.
It's like the eye of the owl.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.396
This is irresistible in my opinion.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.876
But there's even another idea.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.116
Option number three.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.756
Option number three
was based actually on language.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.076
It's the idea that "read"
is the past tense of "read,"

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.956
and they're both spelled the same way.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.916
So why don't we call
this place The Red Zone?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.369
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:16.953
Are you Red? Get Red.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.916
I'm well Red.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.156
(Laughter)

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.516
I really loved this idea,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.876
and I somehow was not focused on the idea

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.796
that librarians as a class are sort of
interested in spelling and I don't know.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.755
(Laughter)

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.276
But sometimes cleverness
is more important than spelling,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.716
and I thought this would be
one of those instances.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.756
So usually when I make these presentations

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.556
I say there's just one question
and the question should be,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.956
"How can I thank you, Mike?"

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.596
But in this case,
the question was more like,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.036
"Um, are you kidding?"

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.756
Because, they said,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.156
the premise of all this work

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.316
was that kids were bored
with old libraries, musty old libraries.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.556
They were tired of them.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.916
And instead, they said, these kids
have never really seen a library.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.756
The school libraries in these schools

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.196
are really so dilapidated,
if they're there at all,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.156
that they haven't bored anyone.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.156
They haven't even been there
to bore anyone at all.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.596
So the idea was, just forget
about giving it a new name.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.676
Just call it, one last try, a library.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.916
Right? OK.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.796
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.036
Exclamation point?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.036
Then -- this is because I'm clever --

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.596
move that into the "i,"

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.876
make it red,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.076
and there you have it,
the Library Initiative.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.636
So I thought, mission accomplished,
there's your logo.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.716
So what's interesting about this logo,
an unintended consequence,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.876
was that it turned out that
they didn't really even need my design

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.876
because you could type it any font,
you could write it by hand,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.996
and when they started
sending emails around,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.596
they just would use Shift and 1,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.196
they'd get their own logo
just right out of the thing.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.956
And I thought, well, that's fine.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.756
Feel free to use that logo.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.676
And then I embarked
on the real rollout of this thing --

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.636
working with every one of the architects

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660
to put this logo on the front door
of their own library. Right?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.556
So here's the big rollout.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.836
Basically I'd work
with different architects.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.076
First Robin Hood was my client.
Now these architects were my client.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.339
I'd say, "Here's your logo.
Put it on the door."

00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:13.316
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.356
"Here's your logo.
Put it off to the side."

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.636
"Here's your logo
repeated all over to the top."

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.356
So everything was going swimmingly.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.036
I just was saying,
"Here's your logo. Here's your logo."

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.196
Then I got a call
from one of the architects,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.076
a guy named Richard Lewis,
and he says, "I've got a problem.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.116
You're the graphics guy.
Can you solve it?"

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.356
And I said, OK, sure."

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.956
And he said, "The problem is
that there's a space

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.796
between the shelf and the ceiling."

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.156
So that sounds like
an architectural issue to me,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.276
not a graphic design issue,
so I'm, "Go on."

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.956
And Richard says, "Well,
the top shelf has to be low enough

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.196
for the kid to reach it,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.220
but I'm in a big old building,
and the ceilings are really high,

00:06:47.244 --> 00:06:49.316
so actually I've got
all this space up there

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.036
and I need something like a mural."

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.996
And I'm like, "Whoa,
you know, I'm a logo designer.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.156
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.796
I'm not a muralist."

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.196
And so he said, "But can't you
think of anything?"

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.596
So I said, "OK, what if we just
took pictures of the kids in the school

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.076
and just put them around
the top of the thing,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.436
and maybe that could work."

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.316
And my wife is a photographer,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.276
and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.476
can you come to this school
in east New York, take these pictures?"

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.716
And she did,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.716
and if you go in Richard's library,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.596
which is one of the first that opened,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.716
it has this glorious frieze
of, like, the heroes of the school,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.436
oversized, looking down

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.476
into the little dollhouse
of the real library, right?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.316
And the kids were great,
hand-selected by the principals

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.116
and the librarian.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.396
It just kind of created
this heroic atmosphere in this library,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.916
this very dignified setting below
and the joy of the children above.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.276
So naturally all the other librarians
in the other schools see this

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.236
and they said, well, we want murals too.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.556
And I'm like, OK.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.476
So then I think, well,
it can't be the same mural every time,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.556
so Dorothy did another one,
and then she did another one,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.196
but then we needed more help,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.076
so I called an illustrator I knew
named Lynn Pauley,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.036
and Lynn did these beautiful
paintings of the kids.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.396
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin
at a place called Automatic Design.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.220
He did these amazing collages.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.116
We had Rafael Esquer

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.996
do these great silhouettes.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.196
He would work with the kids,
asking for words,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.796
and then based on those prompts,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.516
come up with this little,
delirious kind of constellation

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.596
of silhouettes
of things that are in books.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.196
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.316
and had them talk
about their favorite books

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.596
and he put their testimony
as a frieze up there.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.876
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.196
and they did this amazing
manga-style statement,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.676
"Everyone who is honest is interesting,"

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.556
that goes all the way around.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.956
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.356
did a whole series of things

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.396
where he embedded books
into the faces and characters

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.556
and images and places
that you find in the books.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.619
And then even Maira Kalman

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.475
did this amazing cryptic installation
of objects and words

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:55.676
that kind of go all around
and will fascinate students

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.276
for as long as it's up there.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.956
So this was really satisfying,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.876
and basically my role here was reading
a series of dimensions to these artists,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.156
and I would say,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.876
"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.116
Let me know if you have
any problem with that."

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.356
And they would go and install these.
It just was the greatest thing.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.676
But the greatest thing, actually, was --

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.916
Every once in a while,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.156
I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail
made of construction paper,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.476
and it would say, "You are invited
to the opening of our new library."

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.876
So you'd go to the library,
say, you'd go to PS10,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.116
and you'd go inside.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.916
There'd be balloons,
there'd be a student ambassador,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.076
there'd be speeches that were read,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.996
poetry that was written
specifically for the opening,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.956
dignitaries would present people
with certificates,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.596
and the whole thing
was just a delirious, fun party.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.236
So I loved going to these things.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.236
I would stand there dressed like this,
obviously not belonging,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.927
and someone would say,
"What are you doing here, mister?"

00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:52.116
And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team
that designed this place."

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.045
And they'd said, "You do these shelves?"

00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:56.476
And I said, "No."
"You took the pictures up above."

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.716
"No."

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.956
"Well, what did you do?"

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.436
"You know when you came in?
The sign over the door?"

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.876
"The sign that says library?"

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.916
(Laughter)

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.156
"Yeah, I did that!"

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.300
And then they'd sort of go,
"OK. Nice work if you can get it."

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.116
So it was so satisfying
going to these little openings

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.876
despite the fact that I was
kind of largely ignored or humiliated,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.076
but it was actually fun
going to the openings,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.796
so I decided that I wanted
to get the people in my office

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.276
who had worked on these projects,
get the illustrators and photographers,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.996
and I said, why don't we rent a van

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.396
and drive around
the five boroughs of New York

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.436
and see how many we could hit at one time.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.316
And eventually there were
going to be 60 of these libraries,

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.116
so we probably got to see
maybe half a dozen in one long day.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.076
And the best thing of all
was meeting these librarians

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.676
who kind of were running these,
took possession of these places

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.276
like their private stage
upon which they were invited

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.236
to mesmerize their students
and bring the books to life,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.796
and it was just
this really exciting experience

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.636
for all of us to actually
see these things in action.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.196
So we spent a long day doing this

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.036
and we were in the very last library.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.876
It was still winter,
because it got dark early,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.116
and the librarian says,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.836
"I'm about to close down.
So really nice having you here.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.996
Hey, wait a second, do you want to see
how I turn off the lights?"

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.316
I'm like, "OK."

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.836
And she said, "I have
this special way that I do it."

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.116
And then she showed me.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.596
What she did was she turned out
every light one by one by one by one,

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.676
and the last light she left on

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.596
was the light that illuminated
the kids' faces,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.476
and she said, "That's the last light
I turn off every night,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.076
because I like to remind myself
why I come to work."

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.956
So when I started this whole thing,

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.171
remember, it was just
about designing that logo

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.196
and being clever, come up with a new name?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.796
The unintended consequence here,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.636
which I would like to take credit for

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.876
and like to think I can think through
the experience to that extent,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.116
but I can't.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.116
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,
as far as I could reach with my own hands.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.716
Instead, way off in the distance

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.996
was a librarian

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.956
who was going to find
the chain of consequences

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.396
that we had set in motion,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.916
a source of inspiration

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.316
so that she in this case
could do her work really well.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.716
40,000 kids a year
are affected by these libraries.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.196
They've been happening
for more than 10 years now,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.756
so those librarians have kind of turned on
a generation of children to books

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.276
and so it's been a thrill to find out

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.036
that sometimes unintended consequences
are the best consequences.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.276
Thank you very much.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.180
(Applause)
