00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:19.068
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:20.673
and how to make a movement.

00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:23.111
So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish,

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:24.379
in under three minutes

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:26.236
and dissect some lessons from it.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.618
First, of course you know,

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:31.060
a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed.

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.521
What he's doing is so easy to follow.

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:36.909
Here's his first follower
with a crucial role;

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.236
he's going to show everyone
else how to follow.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.815
Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal.

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.784
Now it's not about the leader anymore;

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:45.236
it's about them, plural.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:47.813
Now, there he is calling to his friends.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:49.837
Now, if you notice that the first follower

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.236
is actually an underestimated form
of leadership in itself.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.236
It takes guts to stand out like that.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:00.236
The first follower is what transforms
a lone nut into a leader.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.236
(Laughter)

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.481
(Applause)

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:07.236
And here comes a second follower.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.658
Now it's not a lone nut,
it's not two nuts --

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:12.236
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.236
So a movement must be public.

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:17.836
It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.756
because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.832
Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after,

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.236
three more people.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.680
Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point.

00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:30.481
Now we've got a movement.

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:31.505
(Laughter)

00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:34.236
So, notice that, as more people join in,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.824
it's less risky.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:38.079
So those that were sitting
on the fence before

00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:39.613
now have no reason not to.

00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:42.977
They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed,

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.810
but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.566
(Laughter)

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.105
So, over the next minute,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.891
you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:56.176
because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.177
And that's how you make a movement.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.177
But let's recap some lessons from this.

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.236
So first, if you are the type,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.236
like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.236
remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.710
so it's clearly
about the movement, not you.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:13.796
(Laughter)

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.336
Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.236
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.781
did you catch it? --

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.236
is that leadership is over-glorified.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.037
Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first,

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.570
and he'll get all the credit,

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:28.384
but it was really the first follower

00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:31.236
that transformed the lone nut
into a leader.

00:02:31.748 --> 00:02:33.999
So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders,

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:35.615
that would be really ineffective.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.043
If you really care
about starting a movement,

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.236
have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.874
And when you find a lone nut
doing something great,

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:47.236
have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.599
And what a perfect place
to do that, at TED.

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.236
Thanks.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.862
(Applause)
