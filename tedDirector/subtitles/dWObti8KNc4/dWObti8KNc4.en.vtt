00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.060
One of the first patients
I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.150
a beautiful month-old baby

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.830
who was admitted with signs
of a severe respiratory infection.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.110
Until then, I had never seen
a patient worsen so fast.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.810
In just two days
she was connected to a respirator

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.550
and on the third day she died.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.300
Sol had whooping cough.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.010
After discussing the case in the room
and after a quite distressing catharsis,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.509
I remember my chief resident said to me,

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:47.850
"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.050
And now comes the hardest part:

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.460
We have to go talk to her parents."

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.120
At that time, a thousand questions
came to mind,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.450
from, "How could a one-month-old
baby be so unfortunate?"

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.070
to, "Could we have done
something about it?"

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.680
Before vaccines existed,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.550
many infectious diseases
killed millions of people per year.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.630
During the 1918 flu pandemic

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.780
50 million people died.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.060
That's greater than Argentina's
current population.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.110
Perhaps, the older ones among you
remember the polio epidemic

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.030
that occurred in Argentina in 1956.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.560
At that time, there was no vaccine
available against polio.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.090
People didn't know what to do.
They were going crazy.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.370
They would go painting trees
with caustic lime.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.940
They'd put little bags of camphor

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.460
in their children's underwear,
as if that could do something.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.600
During the polio epidemic,
thousands of people died.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.770
And thousands of people were left
with very significant neurological damage.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.290
I know this because I read about it,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.080
because thanks to vaccines,
my generation was lucky

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.890
to not live through an epidemic
as terrible as this.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.680
Vaccines are one of the great successes
of the 20th century's public health.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.230
After potable water,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.840
they are the interventions
that have most reduced mortality,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.970
even more than antibiotics.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.560
Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases
such as smallpox from the planet

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.200
and succeeded in significantly
reducing mortality

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.450
due to other diseases such as measles,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.780
whooping cough, polio and many more.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.200
All these diseases are considered
vaccine-preventable diseases.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.670
What does this mean?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.690
That they are potentially preventable,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.660
but in order to be so,
something must be done.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.760
You need to get vaccinated.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.970
I imagine that most,
if not all of us here today,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.210
received a vaccine
at some point in our life.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.960
Now, I'm not so sure that many of us know

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.290
which vaccines or boosters
we should receive after adolescence.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.790
Have you ever wondered
who we are protecting

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.640
when we vaccinate?

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.700
What do I mean by that?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.670
Is there any other effect
beyond protecting ourselves?

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170
Let me show you something.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.220
Imagine for a moment

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.230
that we are in a city

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.480
that has never had a case
of a particular disease,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.180
such as the measles.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.290
This would mean that no one in the city
has ever had contact with the disease.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.880
No one has natural defenses against,
nor been vaccinated against measles.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.420
If one day, a person sick with the measles
appears in this city

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.510
the disease won't find much resistance

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.440
and will begin spreading
from person to person,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.500
and in no time it will disseminate
throughout the community.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.530
After a certain time

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.900
a big part of the population will be ill.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.910
This happened when there were no vaccines.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.110
Now, imagine the complete opposite case.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.830
We are in a city

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.650
where more than 90 percent
of the population

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.100
has defenses against
the measles, which means

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.839
that they either had the disease,
survived, and developed natural defenses;

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.540
or that they had been
immunized against measles.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.810
If one day,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.740
a person sick with the measles
appears in this city,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.610
the disease will find much more resistance

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.100
and won't be transmitted
that much from person to person.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.330
The spread will probably remain contained

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.680
and a measles outbreak won't happen.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.760
I would like you
to pay attention to something.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.490
People who are vaccinated

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.290
are not only protecting themselves,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.900
but by blocking the dissemination
of the disease

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.540
within the community,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.220
they are indirectly protecting
the people in this community

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.390
who are not vaccinated.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.660
They create a kind of protective shield

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.760
which prevents them from
coming in contact with the disease,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.380
so that these people are protected.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.870
This indirect protection

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.370
that the unvaccinated people
within a community receive

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.380
simply by being surrounded
by vaccinated people,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.010
is called herd immunity.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.590
Many people in the community

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.090
depend almost exclusively
on this herd immunity

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.750
to be protected against disease.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.720
The unvaccinated people you see
in infographics are not just hypothetical.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.600
Those people are our nieces
and nephews, our children,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.970
who may be too young
to receive their first shots.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.410
They are our parents, our siblings,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.840
our acquaintances,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.710
who may have a disease,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.360
or take medication
that lowers their defenses.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.080
There are also people who are
allergic to a particular vaccine.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.750
They could even be among us,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.610
any of us who got vaccinated,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.410
but the vaccine didn't produce
the expected effect,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.600
because not all vaccines
are always 100 percent effective.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.800
All these people depend
almost exclusively on herd immunity

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.360
to be protected against diseases.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.200
To achieve this effect of herd immunity,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.870
it is necessary that a large percentage
of the population be vaccinated.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.570
This percentage is called the threshold.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.330
The threshold depends on many variables:

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.740
It depends on the germ's characteristics,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.040
and those of the immune response
that the vaccine generates.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.430
But they all have something in common.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.640
If the percentage of the population
in a vaccinated community

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.050
is below this threshold number,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.110
the disease will begin
to spread more freely

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.780
and may generate an outbreak
of this disease within the community.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.860
Even diseases which were 
at some point controlled may reappear.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.740
This is not just a theory.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.100
This has happened,
and is still happening.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.750
In 1998, a British researcher
published an article

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.530
in one of the most important
medical journals,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.150
saying that the MMR vaccine,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.880
which is given for measles,
mumps and rubella,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.750
was associated with autism.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.450
This generated an immediate impact.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.660
People began to stop getting vaccinated,
and stopped vaccinating their children.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.300
And what happened?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.980
The number of people vaccinated,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.960
in many communities around the world,
fell below this threshold.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.520
And there were outbreaks of measles
in many cities in the world --

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.960
in the U.S., in Europe.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.120
Many people got sick.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.900
People died of measles.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.350
What happened?

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.470
This article also generated a huge stir
within the medical community.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.690
Dozens of researchers began to assess
if this was actually true.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.420
Not only could no one find

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.669
a causal association between MMR
and autism at the population level,

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:50.570
but it was also found that this article
had incorrect claims.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.370
Even more, it was fraudulent.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.510
It was fraudulent.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.550
In fact, the journal publicly retracted
the article in 2010.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.780
One of the main concerns and excuses
for not getting vaccinated

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.970
are the adverse effects.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:17.410
Vaccines, like other drugs,
can have potential adverse effects.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.480
Most are mild and temporary.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.470
But the benefits are always greater
than possible complications.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.300
When we are ill,
we want to heal fast.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.420
Many of us who are here

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.090
take antibiotics
when we have an infection,

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.270
we take anti-hypertensives
when we have high blood pressure,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.450
we take cardiac medications.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.700
Why? Because we are sick
and we want to heal fast.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.720
And we don't question it much.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.150
Why is it so difficult
to think of preventing diseases,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.100
by taking care of ourselves
when we are healthy?

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.290
We take care of ourselves a lot
when affected by an illness,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.250
or in situations of imminent danger.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.810
I imagine most of us here,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.540
remember the influenza-A pandemic

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.930
which broke out in 2009
in Argentina and worldwide.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.520
When the first cases
began to come to light,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.360
we, here in Argentina,
were entering the winter season.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.120
We knew absolutely nothing.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.530
Everything was a mess.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.900
People wore masks on the street,
ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.250
People would line up
in pharmacies to get a vaccine,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.810
without even knowing
if it was the right vaccine

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.350
that would protect them
against this new virus.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.650
We knew absolutely nothing.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.480
At that time, in addition to doing
my fellowship at the Infant Foundation,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.650
I worked as a home pediatrician
for a prepaid medicine company.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.910
I remember that I started
my shift at 8 a.m.,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.060
and by 8, I already had a list
of 50 scheduled visits.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.940
It was chaos;
people didn't know what to do.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.410
I remember the types of patients
that I was examining.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.050
The patients were a little older than
what we were used to seeing in winter,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.390
with longer fevers.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.070
And I mentioned that
to my fellowship mentor,

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.590
and he, for his part, had heard
the same from a colleague,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.320
about the large number
of pregnant women

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.010
and young adults

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.250
being hospitalized in intensive care,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.160
with hard-to-manage clinical profiles.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.600
At that time, we set out to understand
what was happening.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.420
First thing Monday morning,
we took the car

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.350
and went to a hospital
in Buenos Aires Province,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:51.020
that served as a referral hospital
for cases of the new influenza virus.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.550
We arrived at the hospital;
it was crowded.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.470
All health staff were dressed
in NASA-like bio-safety suits.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.670
We all had face masks in our pockets.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.400
I, being a hypochondriac,
didn't breathe for two hours.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.520
But we could see what was happening.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.210
Immediately, we started
reaching out to pediatricians

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.430
from six hospitals in the city
and in Buenos Aires Province.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.770
Our main goal was to find out

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.660
how this new virus behaved
in contact with our children,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.240
in the shortest time possible.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.200
A marathon work.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.070
In less than three months,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:35.160
we could see what effect
this new H1N1 virus had

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.300
on the 251 children
hospitalized by this virus.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.500
We could see which children
got more seriously ill:

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.120
children under four, especially those
less than one year old;

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.920
patients with neurological diseases;

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.210
and young children
with chronic pulmonary diseases.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.020
Identifying these at-risk groups
was important

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.730
to include them as priority groups

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.730
in the recommendations
for getting the influenza vaccine,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.590
not only here in Argentina,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.650
but also in other countries
which the pandemic not yet reached.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.430
A year later,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.520
when a vaccine against the pandemic
H1N1 virus became available,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.240
we wanted to see what happened.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.410
After a huge vaccination campaign

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.180
aimed at protecting at-risk groups,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:37.140
these hospitals, with 93 percent
of the at-risk groups vaccinated,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.770
had not hospitalized a single patient

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.450
for the pandemic H1N1 virus.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.500
(Applause)

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.880
In 2009: 251.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.440
In 2010: zero.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.220
Vaccination is an act
of individual responsibility,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.250
but it has a huge collective impact.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.410
If I get vaccinated,
not only am I protecting myself,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.630
but I am also protecting others.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.890
Sol had whooping cough.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.700
Sol was very young,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.230
and she hadn't yet received
her first vaccine against whooping cough.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.960
I still wonder what would have happened

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.870
if everyone around Sol
had been vaccinated.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.800
(Applause)
