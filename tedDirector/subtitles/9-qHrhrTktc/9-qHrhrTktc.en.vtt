00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:20.520
I'm a process engineer, I know all about
boilers and incinerators

00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:23.668
and fabric filters, and cyclones,
and things like that.

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:26.258
But I also have Marfan syndrome.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:28.157
This is an inherited disorder.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:32.352
And in 1992, I participated
in a genetic study,

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:35.464
and found to my horror,
as you can see from the slide,

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.611
that my ascending aorta
was not in the normal range,

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.231
the green line at the bottom.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.138
Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:46.262
and I was already up at 4.4.

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:50.912
And as you can see,
my aorta dilated progressively,

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:55.507
and I got closer and closer to the point
where surgery was going to be necessary.

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.813
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:01.803
Anesthetize you, open your chest,

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.676
put you on an artificial
heart and lung machine,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.869
drop your body temperature
to about 18 centigrade,

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.557
stop your heart, cut the aorta out,

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.595
replace it with a plastic valve
and a plastic aorta.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:19.340
And most importantly, commit you
to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:20.614
Normally, warfarin.

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:23.830
The thought of the surgery
was not attractive.

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:27.771
The thought of the warfarin
was really quite frightening.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:29.561
So I said to myself,

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:33.016
"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&amp;D,
this is just a plumbing problem."

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.046
"I can do this, I can change this."

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.143
So I set out to change the entire
treatment for aortic dilation.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:44.719
The project aim is really quite simple.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.757
The only real problem
with the ascending aorta

00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:50.342
in people with Marfan syndrome

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.321
is that it lacks some tensile strength.

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:58.851
So, the possibility exists
to simply externally wrap the pipe,

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:02.409
and it would remain stable
and operate quite happily.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:07.104
If your high-pressure hose pipe
or hydraulic line bulges a little,

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:10.628
you just wrap some tape around it,
it really is that simple.

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:13.452
In concept, though not in execution.

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:17.588
The great advantage
of an external support, for me,

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:20.301
was that I could retain
all of my own bits,

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.617
all of my own endothelium and valves,

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.441
and not need any anticoagulation therapy.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.283
So, where do we start?

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:31.287
This is a sagittal slice through me.

00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:35.829
In the middle, you can see
that little structure squeezing out,

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:37.340
that's the left ventricle,

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:40.185
pushing blood out
through the aortic valve.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.376
You can see two of the leaflets
of the aortic valve working there.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.246
Up into the ascending aorta.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.224
And it's that part, the ascending aorta,

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:53.934
which dilates and ultimately bursts,
which of course is fatal.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.740
We started by organizing image acquisition

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:02.824
from magnetic resonance
and CT imaging machines,

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:07.297
from which to make a model
of the patient's aorta.

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.480
This is a model of my aorta.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:13.347
I've got a real one in my pocket,

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.851
if anyone would like to look at it,
and play with it.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:16.884
(Laughter)

00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:18.973
You can see it's quite
a complex structure.

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.542
It has a funny tri-lobal shape
at the bottom,

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.561
which contains the aortic valve.

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:25.543
It then comes back into a round form,

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.666
and then tapers and curves off.

00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:31.710
It's quite a difficult structure
to produce.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.801
This is a sort of CAD model of me,

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.741
and this is one of the later CAD models.

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:40.364
We went through an iterative process
of producing better and better models.

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:43.916
When we produced that model,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.215
we turned it into a solid,
plastic model, as you can see,

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.179
using a rapid prototyping technique,
another engineering technique.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.036
We then used that former

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.707
to manufacture a perfectly bespoke
porous textile mesh,

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.542
which takes the shape of the former
and perfectly fits the aorta.

00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:07.200
So this is absolutely personalized
medicine at its best, really.

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:11.847
Every patient we do
has an absolutely bespoke implant.

00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:15.810
Once you've made it,
the installation is quite easy.

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:20.052
John Pepper, bless his heart,
professor of cardiothoracic surgery.

00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:24.632
Never done it before in his life,
he put the first one in, didn't like it,

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:26.023
he put the second one in.

00:04:26.047 --> 00:04:27.285
Happy, away I went.

00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:30.155
Four and a half hours on the table,
and everything was done.

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:33.060
So the surgical implantation
was actually the easiest part.

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:37.193
If you compare our new treatment
to the existing alternative,

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:38.984
the composite aortic root graft,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:41.363
there are one or two startling comparisons

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:43.904
which I'm sure will be
clear to all of you.

00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:47.009
Two hours to install one of our devices,

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:50.415
compared to 6 hours
for the existing treatment.

00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:54.925
As I said, the existing treatment
requires the heart-lung bypass machine,

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.741
and it requires a total body cooling.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.444
We don't need any of that.
We work on a beating heart.

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:00.759
He opens you up,

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.219
he accesses the aorta
while your heart is beating,

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.705
all at the right temperature.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.883
No breaking into your circulatory system.

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:08.396
So it really is great.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.759
But for me, absolutely the best point is,

00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:14.647
there is no anticoagulation
therapy required.

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:16.362
I don't take any drugs at all,

00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:19.123
other than recreational ones
that I would choose to take.

00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:20.500
(Laughter)

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:23.756
And in fact, if you speak to people
who are on long-term warfarin,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.684
it is a serious compromise
to your quality of life,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:30.442
and even worse, it inevitably
foreshortens your life.

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.747
Likewise, if you have
the artificial valve option,

00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.581
you're committed to antibiotic therapy

00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:38.672
whenever you have
any intrusive medical treatment,

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:41.629
even trips to the dentist
require that you take antibiotics,

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:44.034
in case you get an internal
infection on the valve.

00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:47.507
Again, I don't have any of that,
so I'm entirely free,

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.872
my artery is fixed.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:53.595
I haven't got to worry about it,
which is a rebirth for me.

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:58.583
Back to the theme of the presentation,
multidisciplinary research,

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:01.734
how on earth does a process engineer
used to working with boilers

00:06:01.758 --> 00:06:05.735
end up producing a medical device
which transforms his own life?

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.283
Well, the answer to that is,
a multidisciplinary team.

00:06:08.907 --> 00:06:11.619
This is a list of the core team,

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:16.866
and you can see there aren't only two
principal technical disciplines there,

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.158
medicine and engineering,

00:06:18.182 --> 00:06:22.284
but also, there are various specialists
from within those two disciplines.

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:27.190
John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon
who did all the actual work on me.

00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:30.963
But everyone else had to contribute
one way or another.

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.797
Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.

00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:36.870
We had to get good-quality images
from which to make the CAD model.

00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:39.717
Warren Thornton, who still does
all our CAD models for us,

00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.725
had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:47.997
to produce this model from this
really rather difficult input data set.

00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.018
There are some barriers to this, though,
there are some problems.

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:54.295
Jargon is a big one.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.881
I would think no one in this room
understands the first four jargon points.

00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:03.351
The engineers amongst you will recognize
"rapid prototyping" and "CAD."

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:06.709
The medics amongst you, if there are any,
will recognize the first two,

00:07:06.733 --> 00:07:10.366
but there will be nobody else here
that understands all those four words.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.410
Taking the jargon out was very important

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:16.591
to ensure that everyone in the team
understood exactly what was meant

00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:18.260
when a particular phrase was used.

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.821
Our disciplinary conventions
were funny as well.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:24.880
We took a lot of horizontal slice
images through me,

00:07:24.904 --> 00:07:28.404
produced those slices and used them
to build a CAD model.

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:30.703
And the very first CAD model we made,

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:34.890
the surgeons were playing with it
and couldn't quite figure it out.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.355
And then we realized that it was actually
a mirror image of the real aorta.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.836
And it was a mirror image
because in the real world,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.671
we always look down on plans,

00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:47.244
plans of houses, or streets, or maps.

00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:50.068
In the medical world,
they look up at plans.

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.484
So the horizontal images
were all in inversion.

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.666
So, one needs to be careful
with disciplinary conventions.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.815
Everyone needs to understand
what is assumed and what is not.

00:08:02.092 --> 00:08:05.592
Institutional barriers were
another serious headache in the project.

00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:08.300
The Brompton Hospital was taken over

00:08:08.324 --> 00:08:10.590
by the Imperial College
School of Medicine.

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:14.257
And there are some seriously bad
relationship problems

00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.738
between the two organizations.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:18.072
I was working with the Imperial
and the Brompton,

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:20.767
and this generated some serious
problems for the project.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:22.601
Really, problems that shouldn't exist.

00:08:23.847 --> 00:08:25.246
Research &amp; Ethics Committee.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.270
If you want to do anything new in surgery,

00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:30.283
you have to get a license
from your local Research &amp; Ethics.

00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:32.132
I'm sure it's the same in Poland.

00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:37.254
There will be some form of equivalent
which licenses new types of surgery.

00:08:37.608 --> 00:08:40.751
We didn't only have the bureaucratic
problems associated with that,

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.862
we also had professional jealousies.

00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:45.315
There were people
on the Research &amp; Ethics committee

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:48.068
who really didn't want to see
John Pepper succeed again.

00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:49.943
Because he is so successful.

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:52.105
And they made extra problems for us.

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:55.650
Bureaucratic problems.

00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:58.328
Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,

00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:02.369
you have to have a guidance note
for all the hospitals in the country.

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:06.013
In the UK, we have the National Institute
and Clinical Excellence.

00:09:06.037 --> 00:09:08.037
You have an equivalent
in Poland, no doubt.

00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:11.346
And we had to get past the NICE problem.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.132
We now have a great clinical
guidance, out on the net.

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:18.796
So any other hospitals interested
can come along, read the NICE report,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.392
get in touch with us,
and then get doing it themselves.

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:28.153
Funding barriers, another big area
to be concerned with.

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:33.234
A big problem with understanding
one of those perspectives.

00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:37.521
When we first approached one of the big,
charitable UK organizations

00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:39.058
that fund this kind of stuff,

00:09:39.082 --> 00:09:41.487
we essentially gave them
an engineering proposal.

00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:44.307
They didn't understand it,
they were doctors, next to God,

00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.181
it must be rubbish, they binned it.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.441
So in the end, I went after
private investors, just gave up on it.

00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:52.695
Most R&amp;D is going to be
institutionally funded,

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.079
by the Polish Academy of Sciences

00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:58.768
or the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council, or whatever.

00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:00.602
And you need to get past those people.

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.136
Jargon is a huge problem
when you try to work across disciplines,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.514
because in an engineering world,
we all understand CAD and RP.

00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.339
Not in the medical world.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.581
I suppose the funding bureaucrats
ultimately have to get their act together.

00:10:13.605 --> 00:10:15.957
They've really got to start
talking to each other,

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.337
and exercise a bit of imagination,
if that's not too much to ask.

00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:20.572
(Laughter)

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.485
Which it probably is.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:23.824
(Laughter)

00:10:23.848 --> 00:10:26.208
I've coined the phrase
"obstructive conservatism."

00:10:26.232 --> 00:10:29.814
So many people in the medical world
don't want to change.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:33.354
Particularly when some jumped-up engineer
has come along with the answer.

00:10:33.378 --> 00:10:34.765
They don't want to change.

00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:37.218
They simply want to do
whatever they've done before.

00:10:37.242 --> 00:10:40.541
And in fact, many surgeons
in the UK are still waiting

00:10:40.565 --> 00:10:43.694
for one of our patients
to have some sort of an episode,

00:10:43.718 --> 00:10:46.373
so that they could say,
"Told you that was no good."

00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:48.633
We've actually got 30 patients.

00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:50.483
At seven and a half years,

00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:52.672
we've got 90 post-op
patient years between us,

00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:54.472
and we haven't had a single problem.

00:10:54.496 --> 00:10:56.634
And still, there are people
in the UK saying,

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:59.414
"That external aortic root,
it will never work, you know."

00:10:59.787 --> 00:11:02.192
It really is a problem.

00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:05.019
I'm sure everyone in this room
has come across arrogance

00:11:05.043 --> 00:11:07.809
amongst medics, doctors,
surgeons, at some point.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:13.199
The middle point is simply the way
that the doctors protect themselves.

00:11:13.223 --> 00:11:15.574
"Well, of course,
I'm looking after my patient."

00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:19.110
I think it's not good, but that's my view.

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:22.098
Egos, of course, again a huge problem.

00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:24.060
If you work in a multidisciplinary team,

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:26.889
you've got to give your guys
the benefit of the doubt,

00:11:26.913 --> 00:11:28.789
you've got to express support for them.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.692
Tom Treasure, professor
of cardiothoracic surgery.

00:11:32.303 --> 00:11:33.524
Incredible guy.

00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:35.038
Dead easy to give him respect.

00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:37.827
Him giving me respect? Slightly different.

00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:38.874
(Laughter)

00:11:39.327 --> 00:11:40.658
That's all the bad news.

00:11:40.682 --> 00:11:44.903
The good news is,
the benefits are stonkingly huge.

00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:47.036
Translate that one! I bet they can't.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.704
(Laughter)

00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:51.967
When you have a group of people
with different professional training,

00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:53.892
a different professional experience,

00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:56.065
they not only have a different
knowledge base,

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:58.310
but also a different perspective
on everything.

00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:00.035
And if you can bring them together,

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:02.871
and get them talking
and understanding each other,

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:05.503
the results can be spectacular.

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:10.618
You can find really novel solutions
that have never been looked at before,

00:12:10.642 --> 00:12:12.364
very quickly and easily.

00:12:12.388 --> 00:12:15.657
You can short-cut huge amounts of work

00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:19.286
simply by using the extended
knowledge base you have.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.082
And as a result,
it's an entirely different use

00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:26.595
of the technology
and the knowledge around you.

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:31.283
The result of all this is that you can get
incredibly quick progress

00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:33.407
on incredibly small budgets.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.673
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap
it was to get from my idea

00:12:37.697 --> 00:12:39.031
to me being implanted

00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:41.315
that I'm not prepared
to tell you what it cost,

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:45.604
because I suspect there are
absolutely standard surgical treatments,

00:12:45.628 --> 00:12:46.974
probably in the USA,

00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:51.790
which cost more for a one-off patient

00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:56.048
than the cost of us getting from
my dream to my reality.

00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:59.477
That's all I want to say,
and I've got three minutes left.

00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:00.956
So, Ewa's going to like me.

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:04.495
If you have any questions,
please come up and talk to me later on,

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.628
it would be a pleasure to speak with you.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:07.660
Many thanks.

00:13:07.684 --> 00:13:08.684
(Applause)
