00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.407
So I've been thinking about the difference between

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:17.541
the résumé virtues and 
the eulogy virtues.

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:20.443
The résumé virtues are the
ones you put on your résumé,

00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:23.909
which are the skills 
you bring to the marketplace.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.647
The eulogy virtues are the ones

00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:27.129
that get mentioned in the eulogy,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.067
which are deeper: who are you, 
in your depth,

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.843
what is the nature of your relationships,

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:35.407
are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:36.901
And most of us, including 
me, would say

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.117
that the eulogy virtues are the
more important of the virtues.

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:42.200
But at least in my case, 
are they the ones that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.002
I think about the most? 
And the answer is no.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.295
So I've been thinking about that problem,

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:48.463
and a thinker who has 
helped me think about it

00:00:48.463 --> 00:00:50.076
is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.446
who wrote a book called "The
Lonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:56.766
Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.156
which he called Adam I
and Adam II.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:00.888
Adam I is the worldly, ambitious,

00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:03.111
external side of our nature.

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.184
He wants to build, create,
create companies,

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:06.730
create innovation.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.468
Adam II is the humble
side of our nature.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.285
Adam II wants not only 
to do good but to be good,

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.232
to live in a way internally

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:18.035
that honors God, creation and our possibilities.

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:19.923
Adam I wants to conquer the world.

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:22.687
Adam II wants to hear 
a calling and obey the world.

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:25.175
Adam I savors accomplishment.

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:27.857
Adam II savors inner 
consistency and strength.

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:30.600
Adam I asks how things work.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.918
Adam II asks why we're here.

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:35.022
Adam I's motto is "success."

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:39.268
Adam II's motto is "love, redemption and return."

00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:41.118
And Soloveitchik argued 
that these two sides

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:43.766
of our nature are 
at war with each other.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.830
We live in perpetual self-confrontation

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.094
between the external success and the internal value.

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:51.578
And the tricky thing, 
I'd say, about these

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.270
two sides of our nature is they work

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.680
by different logics.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.914
The external logic is 
an economic logic:

00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:01.380
input leads to output, 
risk leads to reward.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.156
The internal side of our nature

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.577
is a moral logic and 
often an inverse logic.

00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:08.451
You have to give to receive.

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.167
You have to surrender 
to something outside yourself

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:12.449
to gain strength within yourself.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.770
You have to conquer the
desire to get what you want.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.561
In order to fulfill yourself,
you have to forget yourself.

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:21.873
In order to find yourself, 
you have to lose yourself.

00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:24.809
We happen to live in a society 
that favors Adam I,

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.049
and often neglects Adam II.

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.281
And the problem is, that turns
you into a shrewd animal

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:31.838
who treats life as a game,

00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:34.563
and you become a cold, 
calculating creature

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.369
who slips into a sort of mediocrity

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.829
where you realize there's a difference

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.401
between your desired 
self and your actual self.

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:45.374
You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:46.934
you hope someone will give to you.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.660
You don't have the 
depth of conviction.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.197
You don't have an emotional sonorousness.

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:52.966
You don't have 
commitment to tasks

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.180
that would take more than a lifetime to commit.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.627
I was reminded of a common
response through history

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.389
of how you build a solid Adam II,

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.399
how you build a depth of character.

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.124
Through history, people 
have gone back

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.010
into their own pasts,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.260
sometimes to a precious 
time in their life,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.719
to their childhood,

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.685
and often, the mind 
gravitates in the past

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:18.073
to a moment of shame,

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:21.000
some sin committed, 
some act of selfishness,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.290
an act of omission, of shallowness,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.033
the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.618
trying to be a people-pleaser, 
a lack of courage.

00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:34.313
Adam I is built by 
building on your strengths.

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:38.409
Adam II is built by fighting 
your weaknesses.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.267
You go into yourself, 
you find the sin

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:42.939
which you've committed over
and again through your life,

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.740
your signature sin

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.431
out of which the others emerge,

00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:50.295
and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:53.431
and out of that wrestling, 
that suffering,

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:57.049
then a depth of character is constructed.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.951
And we're often not
taught to recognize

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.087
the sin in ourselves,

00:04:00.087 --> 00:04:01.935
in that we're not taught in this culture

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:03.882
how to wrestle with it,

00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:06.555
how to confront it, 
and how to combat it.

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.885
We live in a culture 
with an Adam I mentality

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:13.054
where we're inarticulate 
about Adam II.

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:14.710
Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.845
summed up the confrontation, the fully lived

00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:20.398
Adam I and Adam II life, this way:

00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:23.660
"Nothing that is worth doing
can be achieved in our lifetime;

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.042
therefore we must 
be saved by hope.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:29.148
Nothing which is true or
beautiful or good makes

00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:32.104
complete sense in any immediate context of history;

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:34.782
therefore we must be saved by faith.

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:38.672
Nothing we do, however virtuous,
can be accomplished alone;

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:41.718
therefore we must 
be saved by love.

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:44.155
No virtuous act is quite as virtuous

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:48.141
from the standpoint of our friend
or foe as from our own standpoint.

00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:50.968
Therefore we must be saved 
by that final form of love,

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:52.604
which is forgiveness.”

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.680
Thanks.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.398
(Applause)
