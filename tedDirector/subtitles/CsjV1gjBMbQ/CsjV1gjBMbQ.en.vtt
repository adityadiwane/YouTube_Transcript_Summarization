00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I'm a creative technologist

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and the focus of my work is on public installations.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
One of my driving passions

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
is this idea of exploring nature,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
and trying to find hidden data within nature.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
It seems to me that there is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
this latent potential everywhere, all around us.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Everything gives out some kind of data,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
whether it's sound or smell or vibration.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
Through my work, I've been

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
And so this basically led me to

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
a subject called cymatics.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
as you can see there.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
beginning with the observations of resonance,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
and then Ernest Chladni.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
He created an experiment using a metal plate,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
covering it with sand and then bowing it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.330
to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
He actually coined the term cymatics.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Then bringing us into the present day

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
is a fellow collaborator of mine

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
He's kindly recreated for us

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
the Chladni experiment.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
What we can see here is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
and being fed by a frequency generator.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
As the frequencies increase,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
As you can see with your own eyes.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.330
(Applause)

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
So, what excites me about cymatics?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.330
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.330
we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.330
For example, in oceanography,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
of how they communicate.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
We can also use cymatics for healing and education.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
This is an installation developed with school children,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
where their hands are tracked. It allows them

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
to control and position cymatic patterns

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
and the reflections that are caused by them.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
This image here is created from a snippet

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.330
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
This is Pink Floyd's "Machine"

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
playing in real time through the cymascope.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.330
So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
And there is thousands of these.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
So what does this all mean?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Well, there is still a lot to explore

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.330
cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
DIY scientists and artists

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
from all over the globe.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
Cymatics is accessible to everybody.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
I want to urge everybody here to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
apply your passion, your knowledge

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
and your skills to areas like cymatics.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
I think collectively we can build a global community.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
We can inspire each other.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
And we can evolve this exploration

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
of the substance of things not seen. Thank you.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
(Applause)
