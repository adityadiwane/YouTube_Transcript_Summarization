00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.566
Intelligence -- what is it?

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.857
If we take a look back at the history

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.481
of how intelligence has been viewed,

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:25.099
one seminal example has been

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.576
Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:31.687
"the question of whether a machine can think

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:32.997
is about as interesting

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:35.968
as the question of whether a submarine

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.758
can swim."

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:41.602
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.656
intended it as a criticism

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.656
of the early pioneers of computer science,

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.403
like Alan Turing.

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:50.902
However, if you take a look back

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:52.867
and think about what have been

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:54.863
the most empowering innovations

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:56.742
that enabled us to build

00:00:56.742 --> 00:00:58.976
artificial machines that swim

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.549
and artificial machines that [fly],

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.096
you find that it was only through understanding

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:07.704
the underlying physical mechanisms

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:10.483
of swimming and flight

00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:13.655
that we were able to build these machines.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.911
And so, several years ago,

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:19.160
I undertook a program to try to understand

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.794
the fundamental physical mechanisms

00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:24.562
underlying intelligence.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:26.422
Let's take a step back.

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:29.571
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:32.425
Pretend that you're an alien race

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.466
that doesn't know anything about Earth biology

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.582
or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:40.774
but you have amazing telescopes

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:43.136
and you're able to watch the Earth,

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.468
and you have amazingly long lives,

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:46.967
so you're able to watch the Earth

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.409
over millions, even billions of years.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.424
And you observe a really strange effect.

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:57.736
You observe that, over the course of the millennia,

00:01:57.736 --> 00:02:02.021
Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.108
up until a point,

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:05.639
and that at some point,

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.831
corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:11.547
asteroids that are on

00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:13.478
a collision course with the Earth

00:02:13.478 --> 00:02:15.453
that otherwise would have collided

00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:17.868
mysteriously get deflected

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:20.940
or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.023
Now of course, as earthlings,

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:24.567
we know the reason would be

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.323
that we're trying to save ourselves.

00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:29.403
We're trying to prevent an impact.

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.114
But if you're an alien race

00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:32.260
who doesn't know any of this,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.774
doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,

00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:36.502
you'd be forced to put together

00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:39.420
a physical theory that explains how,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.958
up until a certain point in time,

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:46.407
asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:49.638
mysteriously stop doing that.

00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:53.842
And so I claim that this is the same question

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:57.840
as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.722
So in this program that I
undertook several years ago,

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:04.487
I looked at a variety of different threads

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:07.649
across science, across a variety of disciplines,

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.541
that were pointing, I think,

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:12.089
towards a single, underlying mechanism

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.670
for intelligence.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.216
In cosmology, for example,

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.963
there have been a variety of
different threads of evidence

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:22.370
that our universe appears to be finely tuned

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.523
for the development of intelligence,

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:26.912
and, in particular, for the development

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.798
of universal states

00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:32.896
that maximize the diversity of possible futures.

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:35.240
In game play, for example, in Go --

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.265
everyone remembers in 1997

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:42.216
when IBM's Deep Blue beat 
Garry Kasparov at chess --

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:43.739
fewer people are aware

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.757
that in the past 10 years or so,

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:46.955
the game of Go,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.911
arguably a much more challenging game

00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.336
because it has a much higher branching factor,

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.038
has also started to succumb

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:54.903
to computer game players

00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:56.476
for the same reason:

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:59.276
the best techniques right now
for computers playing Go

00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:02.972
are techniques that try to maximize future options

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.986
during game play.

00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:08.567
Finally, in robotic motion planning,

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:10.749
there have been a variety of recent techniques

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.651
that have tried to take advantage

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.797
of abilities of robots to maximize

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.303
future freedom of action

00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:20.400
in order to accomplish complex tasks.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.755
And so, taking all of these different threads

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:24.377
and putting them together,

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:27.017
I asked, starting several years ago,

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.867
is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:31.540
that we can factor out

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.314
of all of these different threads?

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.907
Is there a single equation for intelligence?

00:04:37.907 --> 00:04:41.278
And the answer, I believe, is yes.
["F = T ∇ Sτ"]

00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:43.191
What you're seeing is probably

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.485
the closest equivalent to an E = mc²

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:49.315
for intelligence that I've seen.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.017
So what you're seeing here

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:53.686
is a statement of correspondence

00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:58.121
that intelligence is a force, F,

00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.771
that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.146
It acts to maximize future freedom of action,

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:06.774
or keep options open,

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:08.999
with some strength T,

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.776
with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,

00:05:13.776 --> 00:05:16.326
up to some future time horizon, tau.

00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:19.535
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:22.590
Intelligence tries to maximize
future freedom of action

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.263
and keep options open.

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:27.696
And so, given this one equation,

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:30.228
it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:31.579
How predictive is it?

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:33.714
Does it predict human-level intelligence?

00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:36.532
Does it predict artificial intelligence?

00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:38.574
So I'm going to show you now a video

00:05:38.574 --> 00:05:41.994
that will, I think, demonstrate

00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:44.282
some of the amazing applications

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:46.601
of just this single equation.

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.580
(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.627
has suggested that universes that produce

00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:54.108
more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:56.586
should tend to have more favorable conditions

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:59.602
for the existence of intelligent
beings such as ourselves.

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.176
But what if that tentative cosmological connection

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:04.019
between entropy and intelligence

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.790
hints at a deeper relationship?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.354
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate

00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:10.198
with the production of long-term entropy,

00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:12.516
but actually emerges directly from it?

00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:14.922
To find out, we developed a software engine

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:17.425
called Entropica, designed to maximize

00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:19.193
the production of long-term entropy

00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:21.769
of any system that it finds itself in.

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:23.924
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass

00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:27.380
multiple animal intelligence
tests, play human games,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.526
and even earn money trading stocks,

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.637
all without being instructed to do so.

00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:34.155
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.

00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:37.360
Just like a human standing
upright without falling over,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.590
here we see Entropica

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.475
automatically balancing a pole using a cart.

00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:43.487
This behavior is remarkable in part

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:45.818
because we never gave Entropica a goal.

00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:48.975
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.107
This balancing ability will have appliactions

00:06:51.107 --> 00:06:52.504
for humanoid robotics

00:06:52.504 --> 00:06:55.019
and human assistive technologies.

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:57.020
Just as some animals can use objects

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.462
in their environments as tools

00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:00.449
to reach into narrow spaces,

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.331
here we see that Entropica,

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:04.169
again on its own initiative,

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.079
was able to move a large
disk representing an animal

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:09.424
around so as to cause a small disk,

00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:12.195
representing a tool, to reach into a confined space

00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:13.732
holding a third disk

00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:16.704
and release the third disk
from its initially fixed position.

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:18.893
This tool use ability will have applications

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:21.252
for smart manufacturing and agriculture.

00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:23.196
In addition, just as some other animals

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:25.892
are able to cooperate by pulling
opposite ends of a rope

00:07:25.892 --> 00:07:27.945
at the same time to release food,

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.240
here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.228
a model version of that task.

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:34.750
This cooperative ability has interesting implications

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.185
for economic planning and a variety of other fields.

00:07:38.185 --> 00:07:40.256
Entropica is broadly applicable

00:07:40.256 --> 00:07:42.199
to a variety of domains.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:44.641
For example, here we see it successfully

00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:47.200
playing a game of pong against itself,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.543
illustrating its potential for gaming.

00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:51.462
Here we see Entropica orchestrating

00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:53.301
new connections on a social network

00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.061
where friends are constantly falling out of touch

00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:58.917
and successfully keeping
the network well connected.

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.215
This same network orchestration ability

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.543
also has applications in health care,

00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:06.775
energy, and intelligence.

00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:08.860
Here we see Entropica directing the paths

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.346
of a fleet of ships,

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.521
successfully discovering and
utilizing the Panama Canal

00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.979
to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:17.508
to the Pacific.

00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:19.235
By the same token, Entropica

00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:20.855
is broadly applicable to problems

00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:26.157
in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.203
Finally, here we see Entropica

00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:30.926
spontaneously discovering and executing

00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:32.993
a buy-low, sell-high strategy

00:08:32.993 --> 00:08:35.171
on a simulated range traded stock,

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.502
successfully growing assets under management

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:38.926
exponentially.

00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:40.234
This risk management ability

00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:42.721
will have broad applications in finance

00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:46.049
and insurance.

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:48.140
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.532
is that a variety of signature human intelligent

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.289
cognitive behaviors

00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:57.120
such as tool use and walking upright

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.149
and social cooperation

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:02.121
all follow from a single equation,

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:04.053
which drives a system

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:07.964
to maximize its future freedom of action.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.971
Now, there's a profound irony here.

00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:12.995
Going back to the beginning

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:16.268
of the usage of the term robot,

00:09:16.268 --> 00:09:19.171
the play "RUR,"

00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.406
there was always a concept

00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:24.632
that if we developed machine intelligence,

00:09:24.632 --> 00:09:27.659
there would be a cybernetic revolt.

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:31.210
The machines would rise up against us.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.529
One major consequence of this work

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:36.298
is that maybe all of these decades,

00:09:36.298 --> 00:09:39.274
we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt

00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:41.285
in reverse.

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:44.564
It's not that machines first become intelligent

00:09:44.564 --> 00:09:46.579
and then megalomaniacal

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:48.803
and try to take over the world.

00:09:48.803 --> 00:09:50.237
It's quite the opposite,

00:09:50.237 --> 00:09:53.143
that the urge to take control

00:09:53.143 --> 00:09:55.404
of all possible futures

00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:57.522
is a more fundamental principle

00:09:57.522 --> 00:09:58.885
than that of intelligence,

00:09:58.885 --> 00:10:02.585
that general intelligence may in fact emerge

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:06.144
directly from this sort of control-grabbing,

00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:10.329
rather than vice versa.

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:14.098
Another important consequence is goal seeking.

00:10:14.098 --> 00:10:18.458
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:20.078
follow from this sort of framework?

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.106
And the answer is, the ability to seek goals

00:10:23.106 --> 00:10:24.988
will follow directly from this

00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:26.822
in the following sense:

00:10:26.822 --> 00:10:29.687
just like you would travel through a tunnel,

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:32.192
a bottleneck in your future path space,

00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:34.063
in order to achieve many other

00:10:34.063 --> 00:10:36.084
diverse objectives later on,

00:10:36.084 --> 00:10:38.456
or just like you would invest

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:40.243
in a financial security,

00:10:40.243 --> 00:10:42.480
reducing your short-term liquidity

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.880
in order to increase your wealth over the long term,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.217
goal seeking emerges directly

00:10:47.217 --> 00:10:48.946
from a long-term drive

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:52.983
to increase future freedom of action.

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:56.511
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,

00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:00.183
once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed

00:11:00.183 --> 00:11:02.076
and you could pass only a single concept

00:11:02.076 --> 00:11:03.447
on to our descendants

00:11:03.447 --> 00:11:05.754
to help them rebuild civilization,

00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:07.440
that concept should be

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.292
that all matter around us

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:11.615
is made out of tiny elements

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:14.123
that attract each other when they're far apart

00:11:14.123 --> 00:11:17.453
but repel each other when they're close together.

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:19.234
My equivalent of that statement

00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:20.502
to pass on to descendants

00:11:20.502 --> 00:11:23.214
to help them build artificial intelligences

00:11:23.214 --> 00:11:26.163
or to help them understand human intelligence,

00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:27.430
is the following:

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.483
Intelligence should be viewed

00:11:29.483 --> 00:11:30.896
as a physical process

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:33.861
that tries to maximize future freedom of action

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:37.477
and avoid constraints in its own future.

00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:38.835
Thank you very much.

00:11:38.835 --> 00:11:42.835
