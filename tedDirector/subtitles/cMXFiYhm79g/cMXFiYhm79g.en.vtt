00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Meet Tony. He's my student.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
He's about my age,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
When Tony was 16 years old,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
one day, one moment,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
"It was mom's gun.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I say, 'Let's do this.'"

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And that's felony murder --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and Tony's not feeling very lucky.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Tony interrupts me.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
I am told every day,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So I say to Tony,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
You think you know right and wrong?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Then can you tell me what wrong is?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
No, don't just give me an example.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
What is that idea?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
What makes something wrong?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
everyone's got an opinion.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
We are here for knowledge.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
And something changes for Tony.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
I want to know what is wrong.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I want to know what I know."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
the project that begins in wonder --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
what Kant called "admiration and awe

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
at the starry sky above and the moral law within."

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
What can creatures like us know of such things?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
what Heidegger called "the always already there."

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
what Socrates called "the examined life."

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Socrates died in prison,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
his philosophy intact.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So Tony starts doing his homework.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
his logic, his fallacies.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
His body is in prison, but his mind is free.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the epistemologically anxious,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and Bill Clinton.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So when he gives me his final paper,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
in which he argues that the categorical imperative

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
is perhaps too uncompromising

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and challenges me to tell him

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I say, "I don't know.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Let us think about that."

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
it's just the two of us standing there.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It is not professor and convict,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And I say to Tony,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
"Let's do this."

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Thank you.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.260
(Applause)
