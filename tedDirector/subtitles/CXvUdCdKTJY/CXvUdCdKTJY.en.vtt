00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:16.379
Every group of female friends
has the funny one,

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:19.142
the one you go to
when you need a good cry,

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.494
the one who tells you to suck it up
when you've had a hard day.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:24.793
And this group was no different.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:29.179
Except that this was a community
of groundbreaking women

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:30.480
who came together --

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.979
first to become teammates,
then friends, and then family --

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.524
in the least likely of places:

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.901
on the Special Operations battlefield.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:43.002
This was a group of women
whose friendship and valor was cemented

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:47.484
not only by what they had seen
and done at the tip of the spear,

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:49.479
but by the fact that they were there

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:52.021
at a time when women --
officially, at least --

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:54.580
remained banned from ground combat,

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:58.309
and America had no idea they existed.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.408
This story begins
with Special Operations leaders,

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:06.009
some of the most tested men
in the United States military, saying,

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.368
"We need women to help us wage this war."

00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:13.747
"America would never kill its way
to the end of its wars," it argued.

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.431
"Needed more knowledge
and more understanding."

00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:18.219
And as everyone knows,

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:21.790
if you want to understand what's happening
in a community and in a home,

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.387
you talk to women,

00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:26.101
whether you're talking about
Southern Afghanistan,

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:27.840
or Southern California.

00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:31.130
But in this case,
men could not talk to women,

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:34.553
because in a conservative
and traditional society like Afghanistan,

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:36.785
that would cause grave offense.

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:38.991
So you needed women soldiers out there.

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:45.018
That meant, at this time in the war,
that the women who would be recruited

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.905
to serve alongside Army Rangers
and Navy SEALs,

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.389
would be seeing the kind of combat
experienced by less than five percent

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:54.757
of the entire United States military.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.259
Less than five percent.

00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:00.121
So the call went out.

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:02.556
"Female soldiers:
Become a part of history.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.703
Join Special Operations
on the battlefield in Afghanistan."

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.501
This is in 2011.

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.714
And from Alabama to Alaska,

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:14.671
a group of women who had always
wanted to do something that mattered

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:16.673
alongside the best of the best,

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:18.950
and to make a difference
for their country,

00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:20.959
answered that call to serve.

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:27.926
And for them it was not about politics,
it was about serving with purpose.

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:31.316
And so, the women who came
to North Carolina

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.043
to compete for a spot on these teams

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:37.264
which would put women
on the Special Operations front lines,

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:40.659
landed and found
very quickly a community,

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.280
the likes of which they had never seen.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:46.872
Full of women who were as fierce
and as fit as they were,

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:48.678
and as driven to make a difference.

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.567
They didn't have to apologize
for who they were,

00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.591
and in fact, they could celebrate it.

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:58.706
And what they found when they were there
was that all of a sudden,

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.743
there were lots of people like them.

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:02.866
As one of them said,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.936
"It was like you looked
around and realized

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.200
there was more
than one giraffe at the zoo."

00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:11.929
Among this team of standouts was Cassie,

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:16.423
a young woman who managed to be
an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister

00:03:16.447 --> 00:03:19.075
and a Women's Studies minor,
all in one person.

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:24.971
Tristan, a West Point track star,
who always ran and road marched

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.232
with no socks,

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:28.406
and had shoes whose smell proved it.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.873
(Laughter)

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:33.871
Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who had
always wanted to be in the infantry,

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.371
and when she found out
that women couldn't be,

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:39.041
she decided to become an intel officer.

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:40.856
She served in Bosnia,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.445
and later helped the FBI
to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.458
And then there was Kate,
who played high school football

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:49.694
all four years,

00:03:49.718 --> 00:03:52.300
and actually wanted to drop out
after the first,

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:53.801
to go into the glee club,

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:56.708
but when boys told her
that girls couldn't play football,

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:57.989
she decided to stay

00:03:58.013 --> 00:04:00.803
for all the little girls
who would come after her.

00:04:02.268 --> 00:04:04.949
For them, biology had shaped
part of their destiny,

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:07.055
and put, as Cassie once said,

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.571
"everything noble
out of reach for girls."

00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:13.649
And yet, here was a chance
to serve with the best of the best

00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:15.733
on a mission that mattered
to their country,

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:18.432
not despite the fact
that they were female,

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:19.839
but because of it.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.736
This team of women, in many ways,
was like women everywhere.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.331
They wore makeup, and in fact,

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:29.800
they would bond in the ladies' room
over eyeliner and eye pencil.

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:32.166
They also wore body armor.

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:34.931
They would put 50 pounds
of weight on their backs,

00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:36.981
and board the helicopter for an operation,

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.037
and they would come back and watch
a movie called "Bridesmaids."

00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:41.912
(Laughter)

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:44.645
They even wore a thing called Spanx,

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.609
because, as they found very quickly,

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:50.525
the uniforms made for men were
big where they should be small,

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:52.599
and small where they should be big.

00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:56.160
So Lane, an Iraq War veteran --
you see her here on my left --

00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:58.240
decided she was going to go on Amazon

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.383
and order a pair of Spanx to her base,

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:04.159
so that her pants would fit better
when she went out on mission each night.

00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:07.247
These women would get together
over video conference

00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:09.728
from all around Afghanistan
from their various bases,

00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:11.736
and they would talk about what it was like

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.411
to be one of the only women
doing what they were doing.

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:15.612
They would swap jokes,

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.088
they would talk about
what was working, what wasn't,

00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:21.159
what they had learned to do well,
what they needed to do better.

00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:24.606
And they would talk about
some of the lighter moments of being women

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.122
out on the Special Operations front lines,

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.511
including the Shewee,

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:30.850
which was a tool
that let you pee like a guy,

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:35.302
although it's said to have had only
a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:38.417
(Laughter)

00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:40.441
These women lived in the "and."

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.301
They proved you could be fierce
and you could be feminine.

00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:47.197
You could wear mascara and body armor.

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:51.277
You could love CrossFit,
and really like cross-stitch.

00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:56.059
You could love to climb out of helicopters
and you could also love to bake cookies.

00:05:56.578 --> 00:06:00.007
Women live in the and every single day,

00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:03.080
and these women brought that
to this mission as well.

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:07.156
On this life and death battlefield
they never forgot

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:10.557
that being female may have brought them
to the front lines,

00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.358
but being a soldier is what would
prove themselves there.

00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:16.436
There was the night Amber went
out on mission,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.430
and in talking to the women of the house,

00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:21.279
realized that there was
a barricaded shooter lying in wait

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:24.835
for the Afghan and American forces
who were waiting to enter the home.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.213
Another night it was Tristan
who found out

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.401
that there were pieces
that make up explosives

00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:32.722
all around the house
in which they were standing,

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.525
and that in fact, explosives lay
all the way between there

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.037
and where they were
about to head that night.

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.132
There was the night another one
of their teammates proved herself

00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:43.623
to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,

00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:46.043
when she found the intel item
they were looking for

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:48.329
wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.546
And there was the night that Isabel,
another one of their teammates,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.668
found the things
that they were looking for,

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:56.808
and received an Impact Award
from the Rangers

00:06:56.832 --> 00:06:58.558
who said that without her,

00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:01.336
the things and the people
they were looking for that night

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.784
would never have been found.

00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.381
That night and so many others,

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:08.518
they went out to prove themselves,
not only for one another,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.812
but for everybody
who would come after them.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.306
And also for the men
alongside whom they served.

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:19.948
We talk a lot about how
behind every great man is a good woman.

00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:21.511
And in this case,

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:24.773
next to these women stood men
who wanted to see them succeed.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:28.814
The Army Ranger who trained them
had served 12 deployments.

00:07:29.406 --> 00:07:32.400
And when they told him
that he had to go train girls,

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:34.776
he had no idea what to expect.

00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.691
But at the end of eight days with these
women in the summer of 2011,

00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:44.136
he told his fellow Ranger,
"We have just witnessed history.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.784
These may well be
our own Tuskegee Airmen."

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:56.002
(Applause)

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.016
At the heart of this team
was the one person

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.188
who everyone called "the best of us."

00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:04.140
She was a petite blonde dynamo,

00:08:04.164 --> 00:08:06.228
who barely reached five-foot-three.

00:08:06.772 --> 00:08:09.903
And she was this wild mix
of Martha Stewart,

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:11.927
and what we know as G.I. Jane.

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:15.489
She was someone who loved
to make dinner for her husband,

00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:19.616
her Kent State ROTC sweetheart
who pushed her to be her best,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.969
and to trust herself,

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:23.223
and to test every limit she could.

00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:28.114
She also loved to put 50 pounds of weight
on her back and run for miles,

00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.059
and she loved to be a soldier.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.314
She was somebody who had a bread maker
in her office in Kandahar,

00:08:34.338 --> 00:08:37.270
and would bake a batch of raisin bread,
and then go to the gym

00:08:37.294 --> 00:08:40.085
and bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups
from a dead hang.

00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:43.993
She was the person who, if you needed
an extra pair of boots

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:46.972
or a home-cooked dinner,
would be on your speed dial.

00:08:47.404 --> 00:08:49.642
Because she never, ever would talk to you

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:50.817
about how good she was,

00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.049
but let her character speak
through action.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.086
She was famous for taking the hard right
over the easy wrong.

00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:03.877
And she was also famous
for walking up to a 15-foot rope,

00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.061
climbing it using only her arms,

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:08.086
and then shuffling away and apologizing,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.500
because she knew she was supposed
to use both her arms and her legs,

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:13.221
as the Rangers had trained them.

00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:15.121
(Laughter)

00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:18.448
Some of our heroes return home
to tell their stories.

00:09:19.346 --> 00:09:20.958
And some of them don't.

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.503
And on October 22, 2011,

00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:28.095
First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed
alongside two Rangers,

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:29.474
Christopher Horns

00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:30.854
and Kristoffer Domeij.

00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:35.247
Her death threw this program built
for the shadows

00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:37.298
into a very public spotlight.

00:09:37.322 --> 00:09:38.475
Because after all,

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:41.666
the ban on women in combat
was still very much in place.

00:09:42.856 --> 00:09:44.270
And at her funeral,

00:09:44.294 --> 00:09:48.722
the head of Army Special Operations came,
and gave a public testimony

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:50.937
not just to the courage of Ashley White,

00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:52.961
but to all her team of sisters.

00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:58.174
"Make no mistake about it," he said,
"these women are warriors,

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.514
and they have written a new chapter
in what it means to be a female

00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:03.456
in the United States Army."

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:08.667
Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide
and a school bus driver,

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.595
who bakes cookies on the side.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.522
She doesn't remember much
about that overwhelming set of days,

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:17.315
in which grief -- enormous grief --

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:18.622
mixed with pride.

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:21.359
But she does remember one moment.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.319
A stranger with a child
in her hand came up to her

00:10:25.343 --> 00:10:28.025
and she said, "Mrs. White,

00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:30.347
I brought my daughter here today,

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:33.060
because I wanted her to know
what a hero was.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.514
And I wanted her to know
that heroes could be women, too."

00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:43.363
It is time to celebrate
all the unsung heroines

00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.136
who reach into their guts

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:49.377
and find the heart and the grit
to keep going and to test every limit.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.820
This very unlikely band of sisters
bound forever in life and afterward

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.166
did indeed become part of history,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.321
and they paved the way for so many
who would come after them,

00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:05.575
as much as they stood on the shoulders
of those who had come before.

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:10.448
These women showed that warriors come
in all shapes and sizes.

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:13.754
And women can be heroes, too.

00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:15.800
Thank you so much.

00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:21.950
(Applause)
