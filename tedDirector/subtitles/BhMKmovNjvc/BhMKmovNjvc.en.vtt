00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Now, if President Obama

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
then I would have a suggestion for him

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
that I think would vastly improve

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
the mathematics education in this country.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
And it would be easy to implement

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and inexpensive.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
The mathematics curriculum that we have

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
And everything we learn after that

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
is building up towards one subject.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
And I'm here to say

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
every high school graduate should know --

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
should be statistics:

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
probability and statistics.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
(Applause)

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
It's one of the great products of the human mind.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
they should definitely learn calculus

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
by the end of their freshman year of college.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
that very few people actually use calculus

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
On the other hand,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
and should, use on daily basis. Right?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
It's understanding data.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
I think if our students, if our high school students --

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
if all of the American citizens --

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
knew about probability and statistics,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I mean, probability and statistics,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Look, the world has changed

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
from analog to digital.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
from analog to digital,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.160
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
the mathematics of uncertainty,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
of randomness, of data --

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160
that being probability and statistics.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
In summary, instead of our students

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
learning about the techniques of calculus,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I think it would be far more significant

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
if all of them knew what two standard deviations

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
from the mean means. And I mean it.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Thank you very much.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
(Applause)
