00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.395
When we think about mapping cities,

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:17.200
we tend to think about roads
and streets and buildings,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
and the settlement narrative
that led to their creation,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.984
or you might think about
the bold vision of an urban designer,

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.487
but there's other ways
to think about mapping cities

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.653
and how they got to be made.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.746
Today, I want to show you
a new kind of map.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.242
This is not a geographic map.

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:34.373
This is a map of the relationships 
between people in my hometown

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:35.713
of Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:40.130
and what you can see here is that
each dot represents a person,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.424
each line represents a relationship
between those people,

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:46.870
and each color represents a community
within the network.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.732
Now, I'm here on the green side,
down on the far right where the geeks are,

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:55.580
and TEDx also is down 
on the far right. (Laughter)

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.157
Now, on the other side of the network,

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:01.117
you tend to have primarily
African-American and Latino folks

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:04.707
who are really concerned about somewhat
different things than the geeks are,

00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.148
but just to give some sense,

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:08.554
the green part of the network 
we call Smalltimore,

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.099
for those of us that inhabit it,

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.014
because it seems as though
we're living in a very small town.

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.048
We see the same people
over and over again,

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.219
but that's because
we're not really exploring

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.081
the full depth and breadth of the city.

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.833
On the other end of the network,

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:24.770
you have folks who are interested
in things like hip-hop music

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.574
and they even identify with living
in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area

00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:32.990
over, say, the Baltimore city
designation proper.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.090
But in the middle, you see that there's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.573
something that connects
the two communities together,

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:38.452
and that's sports.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.540
We have the Baltimore Orioles,
the Baltimore Ravens football team,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.986
Michael Phelps, the Olympian.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.824
Under Armour, you may have heard of,
is a Baltimore company,

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:48.257
and that community of sports
acts as the only bridge

00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:50.528
between these two ends of the network.

00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:52.423
Let's take a look at San Francisco.

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:55.609
You see something a little bit
different happening in San Francisco.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.002
On the one hand, you do have
the media, politics and news lobe

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.537
that tends to exist
in Baltimore and other cities,

00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:04.892
but you also have this
very predominant group

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:09.285
of geeks and techies that are sort of
taking over the top half of the network,

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.787
and there's even a group
that's so distinct and clear

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:14.137
that we can identify it
as Twitter employees,

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:17.504
next to the geeks, in between
the gamers and the geeks,

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.445
at the opposite end
of the hip-hop spectrum.

00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:22.162
So you can see, though,

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.843
that the tensions that we've
heard about in San Francisco

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.764
in terms of people being
concerned about gentrification

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:30.523
and all the new tech companies
that are bringing new wealth

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:32.620
and settlement into the city are real,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.849
and you can actually see
that documented here.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.869
You can see the LGBT community

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.165
is not really getting along
with the geek community that well,

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.297
the arts community, the music community.

00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:44.070
And so it leads to things like this.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.043
["Evict Twitter"]

00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:46.867
Somebody sent me this photo
a few weeks ago,

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:49.774
and it shows what is happening
on the ground in San Francisco,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:52.158
and I think you can
actually try to understand that

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:53.860
through looking at a map like this.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.620
Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.074
I spent the last few weeks
gathering data about Rio,

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.881
and one of the things
that stood out to me about this city

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.003
is that everything's
really kind of mixed up.

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:07.107
It's a very heterogenous city in a way 
that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:09.562
You still have the lobe of people involved

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:11.946
with government, newspapers,
politics, columnists.

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:15.350
TEDxRio is down in the lower right,
right next to bloggers and writers.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.059
But then you also have this
tremendous diversity of people

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.333
that are interested
in different kinds of music.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.537
Even Justin Bieber fans
are represented here.

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.429
Other boy bands, country singers,

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.337
gospel music, funk and rap
and stand-up comedy,

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:31.376
and there's even a whole section
around drugs and jokes.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:32.862
How cool is that?

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:35.996
And then the Flamengo football team
is also represented here.

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:38.156
So you have that same kind of spread

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:40.871
of sports and civics
and the arts and music,

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.032
but it's represented
in a very different way,

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:46.352
and I think that maybe fits
with our understanding of Rio

00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:50.366
as being a very multicultural,
musically diverse city.

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.984
So we have all this data.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:57.102
It's an incredibly rich set of data
that we have about cities now,

00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:00.348
maybe even richer than any data set
that we've ever had before.

00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:02.272
So what can we do with it?

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:05.142
Well, I think the first thing
that we can try to understand

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.480
is that segregation is a social construct.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.824
It's something that we choose to do,
and we could choose not to do it,

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:12.756
and if you kind of think about it,

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:16.167
what we're doing with this data
is aiming a space telescope at a city

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.199
and looking at it as if was
a giant high school cafeteria,

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.937
and seeing how everybody arranged
themselves in a seating chart.

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:26.250
Well maybe it's time to shake up
the seating chart a little bit.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.790
The other thing that we start to realize

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.428
is that race is a really
poor proxy for diversity.

00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.365
We've got people represented
from all different types of races

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:36.691
across the entire map here --

00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.067
only looking at race

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:41.785
doesn't really contribute to
our development of diversity.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.524
So if we're trying to use diversity

00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:46.605
as a way to tackle some of our
more intractable problems,

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:49.899
we need to start to think 
about diversity in a new way.

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:53.426
And lastly, we have the ability to create

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.520
interventions to start to reshape
our cities in a new way,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.120
and I believe that if
we have that capability,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.185
we may even bear some
responsibility to do so.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.950
So what is a city?

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.156
I think some might say that it is

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:09.316
a geographical area or a collection
of streets and buildings,

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:12.068
but I believe that a city 
is the sum of the relationships

00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.629
of the people that live there,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.680
and I believe that if we can start to
document those relationships in a real way

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.413
then maybe we have a real shot

00:05:21.413 --> 00:05:24.088
at creating those kinds of cities
that we'd like to have.

00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:25.445
Thank you.

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:27.749
(Applause)
