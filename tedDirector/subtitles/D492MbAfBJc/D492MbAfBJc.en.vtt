00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.330
♫ Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else, ♫

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
♫ nobody anywhere. ♫

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:47.330
♫ A moment ago, there were voices and faces to look upon, ♫

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.330
♫ you can't see them anywhere. ♫

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.330
♫ and no one left to say it to, anyway. ♫

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.330
♫ Oh, listen to what I say. ♫

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.330
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.330
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.330
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.330
♫ Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth. ♫

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.330
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.330
♫ Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.330
♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.330
♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.330
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.330
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.330
♫ You don't have to be a big celebrity ♫

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.330
♫ You don't have to be a big star on MTV ♫

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.330
♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see. ♫

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.330
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.330
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.330
♫ I can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.330
♫ She can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
♫ He can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.330
♫ we can make a little bit of difference in this world. ♫

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.330
♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.330
♫ little difference, yeah. ♫

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:41.330
♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:54.330
♫ Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.330
♫ oh yeah. ♫

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.330
(Applause)

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Thank you so much.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.330
(Applause)

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
This is a song that came about

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
because I think it's difficult to be in the world

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
and not be aware of what's going on,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.330
and the wars and so forth.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.330
This song kind of came out of all of that.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.330
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
which I still stand by,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
but this has got something else in it.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
It's called "Peace on Earth."

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
♫ There is no hope. ♫

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
♫ There is no future. ♫

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.330
♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.330
♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.330
♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.330
♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.330
♫ There is no reconciliation ♫

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.330
♫ and no collective compromise. ♫

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.330
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:02.330
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.330
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.330
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
♫ There is no great society. ♫

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.330
♫ There is no universal plan. ♫

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.330
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.330
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:14.330
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
♫ The answer is ♫

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:26.330
♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
♫ a balance of power, ♫

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.330
♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:43.330
♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:53.330
♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:05.330
(Trumpet sounds)

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:46.330
(Trumpet sounds)

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
♫ There in the hallway, ♫

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
♫ peace on Earth. ♫

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.330
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:15.330
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.330
(Applause)
