00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.150
The power of yet.

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.523
I heard about a high school in Chicago

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:22.699
where students had to pass
a certain number of courses to graduate,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:28.222
and if they didn't pass a course,
they got the grade "Not Yet."

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:30.675
And I thought that was fantastic,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.460
because if you get a failing grade,
you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.384
But if you get the grade "Not Yet",

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:40.903
you understand that
you're on a learning curve.

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:44.313
It gives you a path into the future.

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:48.101
"Not Yet" also gave me insight

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.401
into a critical event early in my career,

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.104
a real turning point.

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:56.069
I wanted to see

00:00:56.093 --> 00:01:01.530
how children coped
with challenge and difficulty,

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.722
so I gave 10-year-olds

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:08.275
problems that were
slightly too hard for them.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:14.084
Some of them reacted
in a shockingly positive way.

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:18.108
They said things like,
"I love a challenge,"

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:23.126
or, "You know, I was hoping
this would be informative."

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:29.686
They understood that their abilities
could be developed.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.025
They had what I call a growth mindset.

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:38.954
But other students felt
it was tragic, catastrophic.

00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:43.255
From their more fixed mindset perspective,

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:47.201
their intelligence
had been up for judgment,

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:48.956
and they failed.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.295
Instead of luxuriating
in the power of yet,

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.365
they were gripped in the tyranny of now.

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:01.650
So what do they do next?

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:04.080
I'll tell you what they do next.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:10.317
In one study, they told us
they would probably cheat the next time

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.253
instead of studying more
if they failed a test.

00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:17.660
In another study, after a failure,

00:02:17.684 --> 00:02:20.799
they looked for someone
who did worse than they did

00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:24.271
so they could feel really
good about themselves.

00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:30.604
And in study after study,
they have run from difficulty.

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:37.081
Scientists measured
the electrical activity from the brain

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:40.227
as students confronted an error.

00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.287
On the left, you see
the fixed-mindset students.

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:46.744
There's hardly any activity.

00:02:46.768 --> 00:02:49.045
They run from the error.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.670
They don't engage with it.

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:55.341
But on the right, you have the students
with the growth mindset,

00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:59.284
the idea that abilities can be developed.

00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:01.229
They engage deeply.

00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:04.310
Their brain is on fire with yet.

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:05.962
They engage deeply.

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:08.655
They process the error.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:13.235
They learn from it and they correct it.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.576
How are we raising our children?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.337
Are we raising them
for now instead of yet?

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:26.897
Are we raising kids
who are obsessed with getting As?

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:31.341
Are we raising kids who don't know
how to dream big dreams?

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:38.779
Their biggest goal is getting the next A,
or the next test score?

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:45.949
And are they carrying this need
for constant validation with them

00:03:45.973 --> 00:03:48.116
into their future lives?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.247
Maybe, because employers
are coming to me and saying,

00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.743
"We have already raised a generation

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:59.849
of young workers
who can't get through the day

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:02.438
without an award."

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.445
So what can we do?

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.253
How can we build that bridge to yet?

00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:11.368
Here are some things we can do.

00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:15.367
First of all, we can praise wisely,

00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.599
not praising intelligence or talent.

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.433
That has failed.

00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:22.095
Don't do that anymore.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:26.623
But praising the process
that kids engage in,

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:30.904
their effort, their strategies,
their focus, their perseverance,

00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:32.577
their improvement.

00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:38.629
This process praise creates kids
who are hardy and resilient.

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:42.106
There are other ways to reward yet.

00:04:42.503 --> 00:04:46.777
We recently teamed up with game scientists

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.921
from the University of Washington

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:54.053
to create a new online math game
that rewarded yet.

00:04:54.077 --> 00:05:00.289
In this game, students were rewarded
for effort, strategy and progress.

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:02.845
The usual math game

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.275
rewards you for getting answers
right, right now,

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:10.369
but this game rewarded process.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.160
And we got more effort,

00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:15.355
more strategies,

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.273
more engagement
over longer periods of time,

00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:24.791
and more perseverance when they hit
really, really hard problems.

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:29.083
Just the words "yet"
or "not yet," we're finding,

00:05:29.107 --> 00:05:32.551
give kids greater confidence,

00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:38.952
give them a path into the future
that creates greater persistence.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:44.069
And we can actually
change students' mindsets.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.212
In one study, we taught them

00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:51.693
that every time they push out
of their comfort zone

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:55.139
to learn something new and difficult,

00:05:55.163 --> 00:06:00.815
the neurons in their brain
can form new, stronger connections,

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.264
and over time, they can get smarter.

00:06:04.288 --> 00:06:06.791
Look what happened: In this study,

00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:10.568
students who were not taught
this growth mindset

00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:16.318
continued to show declining grades
over this difficult school transition,

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:22.768
but those who were taught this lesson
showed a sharp rebound in their grades.

00:06:23.318 --> 00:06:29.241
We have shown this now,
this kind of improvement,

00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:35.492
with thousands and thousands of kids,
especially struggling students.

00:06:36.072 --> 00:06:39.541
So let's talk about equality.

00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:44.529
In our country,
there are groups of students

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:47.348
who chronically underperform,

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:50.520
for example, children in inner cities,

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:54.003
or children on Native American
reservations.

00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:57.764
And they've done so poorly for so long

00:06:57.788 --> 00:07:00.871
that many people think it's inevitable.

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:07.295
But when educators create
growth mindset classrooms

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.690
steeped in yet,

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:12.834
equality happens.

00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:17.003
And here are just a few examples.

00:07:17.027 --> 00:07:22.914
In one year, a kindergarten class
in Harlem, New York

00:07:22.938 --> 00:07:27.437
scored in the 95th percentile

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.610
on the national achievement test.

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:34.996
Many of those kids could not hold a pencil

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.752
when they arrived at school.

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:40.482
In one year,

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:45.424
fourth-grade students
in the South Bronx, way behind,

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:51.710
became the number one fourth-grade class
in the state of New York

00:07:51.734 --> 00:07:54.099
on the state math test.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:59.403
In a year, to a year and a half,

00:07:59.427 --> 00:08:04.777
Native American students
in a school on a reservation

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:10.702
went from the bottom
of their district to the top,

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:17.169
and that district included
affluent sections of Seattle.

00:08:17.193 --> 00:08:23.878
So the Native kids
outdid the Microsoft kids.

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:32.125
This happened because the meaning
of effort and difficulty were transformed.

00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.616
Before, effort and difficulty

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.817
made them feel dumb,
made them feel like giving up,

00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:45.599
but now, effort and difficulty,

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:49.135
that's when their neurons
are making new connections,

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.944
stronger connections.

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:54.104
That's when they're getting smarter.

00:08:54.796 --> 00:09:00.166
I received a letter recently
from a 13-year-old boy.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.185
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck,

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:11.158
I appreciate that your writing
is based on solid scientific research,

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:16.164
and that's why I decided
to put it into practice.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:20.075
I put more effort into my schoolwork,

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:23.030
into my relationship with my family,

00:09:23.054 --> 00:09:27.278
and into my relationship
with kids at school,

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:33.748
and I experienced great improvement
in all of those areas.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.435
I now realize I've wasted
most of my life."

00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:46.348
Let's not waste any more lives,

00:09:47.096 --> 00:09:50.874
because once we know

00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:56.280
that abilities are capable of such growth,

00:09:56.304 --> 00:10:03.244
it becomes a basic human right
for children, all children,

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:08.909
to live in places that create that growth,

00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:14.300
to live in places filled with "yet".

00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:16.138
Thank you.

00:10:16.162 --> 00:10:19.460
(Applause)
