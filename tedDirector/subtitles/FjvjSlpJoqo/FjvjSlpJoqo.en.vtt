00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.624
I am honored to be here,

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:23.625
and I'm honored to talk about this topic,

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.474
which I think is of grave importance.

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:26.721
We've been talking a lot

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:32.688
about the horrific impacts of plastic
on the planet and on other species,

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:34.720
but plastic hurts people, too --

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.593
especially poor people.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.418
And both in the production of plastic,

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.160
the use of plastic
and the disposal of plastic,

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.749
the people who have
the bull's-eye on their foreheads

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.463
are poor people.

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:50.564
People got very upset

00:00:50.588 --> 00:00:53.667
when the BP oil spill happened,

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:55.151
for very good reason.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:56.799
People thought, "Oh, my God.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.599
This is terrible, this oil --
it's in the water.

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:03.541
It's going to destroy
the living systems there.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:04.999
People are going to be hurt.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.514
This is a terrible thing,

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:08.873
this oil is going to hurt
the people in the Gulf."

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:10.967
What people don't think about is:

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.150
What if the oil had made it
safely to shore?

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:16.435
What if the oil actually got
where it was trying to go?

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:21.071
Not only would it have been burned
in engines and added to global warming,

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:24.456
but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.615
and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.267
is because the petrochemical industry

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.447
takes that oil and turns it into plastic

00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.651
and in the process, kills people.

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:37.222
It shortens the lives of the people
who live there in the Gulf.

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:41.040
So oil and petrochemicals are not
just a problem when there's a spill;

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:42.774
they're a problem when there's not.

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:45.205
And what we don't often appreciate

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.903
is the price that poor people pay

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.038
for us to have these disposable products.

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:51.598
The other thing
we often don't appreciate is,

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:54.722
it's not just at the point of production
that poor people suffer.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.919
Poor people also suffer
at the point of use.

00:01:57.396 --> 00:01:59.481
Those of us who earn
a certain income level,

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.446
we have something called choice.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.396
The reason why you want
to work hard and have a job

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.091
and not be poor and broke

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.556
is so you can have choices,
economic choices.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:13.037
We actually get a chance
to choose not to use products

00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.278
that have dangerous,
poisonous plastic in them.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.837
Other people who are poor
don't have those choices.

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.835
So low-income people often are the ones

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.843
who are buying the products that have
those dangerous chemicals in them

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:25.306
that their children are using.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.154
Those are the people who wind up
ingesting a disproportionate amount

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:31.345
of this poisonous plastic in using it.

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.602
And people say, "Well, they should
just buy a different product."

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:37.761
Well, the problem with being poor
is you don't have those choices.

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:39.873
You often have to buy
the cheapest products.

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:42.876
The cheapest products
are often the most dangerous.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.496
And if that weren't bad enough --

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.941
if it wasn't just the production
of plastic that's giving people cancer

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:49.469
in places like Cancer Alley,

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:53.001
and shortening lives and hurting
poor kids at the point of use --

00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:55.108
at the point of disposal,

00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:58.390
once again, it's poor people
who bear the burden.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.367
Often, we think we're doing a good thing:

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.039
You're in your office, drinking
your bottled water or whatever it is,

00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:07.822
and you think to yourself,
"I'm going to throw this away.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:11.376
No -- I'm going to be virtuous.
I'm going to put it in the blue bin."

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.432
You think, "I put mine in the blue bin."

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:17.020
And then you look
at your colleague and say,

00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:20.158
"Why, you cretin!
You put yours in the white bin."

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.806
And we use that as a moral tickle.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.575
We feel so good about ourselves.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.854
If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.578
Not you, but I feel this way often.

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:31.236
(Laughter)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.151
And so we kind of have
this moral feel-good moment.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.386
But if we were to be able
to follow that little bottle

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.441
on its journey,

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:42.030
we would be shocked
to discover that, all too often,

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.384
that bottle is going to be put on a boat,

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.486
it's going to go all the way
across the ocean

00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:49.462
at some expense,

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:53.005
and it's going to wind up
in a developing country, often China.

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:54.617
I think in our minds, we imagine

00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.101
somebody's going to take
the little bottle and say,

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.386
"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy
to see you, little bottle."

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.236
(Laughter)

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.624
"You've served so well."

00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:05.671
(Laughter)

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:07.536
He's given a little bottle massage,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.236
a little bottle medal.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.458
And they say, "What would
you like to do next?"

00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:13.830
The little bottle says,
"I just don't know ..."

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.180
(Laughter)

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:17.267
But that's not actually what happens.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.500
You know?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.510
That bottle winds up getting burned.

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:28.299
The recycling of plastic
in many developing countries

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:31.473
means the incineration of the plastic,
the burning of the plastic,

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.923
which releases incredible toxic chemicals

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:35.780
and, once again, kills people.

00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:39.524
And so, poor people
who are making these products

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:42.310
in petrochemical centers
like Cancer Alley,

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:45.412
poor people who are consuming
these products disproportionately,

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:48.950
and then poor people who,
even at the tail end of the recycling,

00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:50.736
are having their lives shortened.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.356
They're all being harmed -- greatly --

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.867
by this addiction that we have
to disposability.

00:04:59.244 --> 00:05:01.726
Now, you think to yourself --
I know how you are --

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.220
you say, "That sure is terrible
for those poor people.

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:09.426
It's just awful. Those poor people.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:12.207
I hope someone does
something to help them."

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.588
But what we don't understand is --

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:17.826
here we are in Los Angeles.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.981
We worked very hard
to get the smog reduction

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:21.560
happening here in Los Angeles.

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:22.815
But guess what?

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.194
Because they're doing so much
dirty production in Asia now,

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:29.826
because the environmental laws
don't protect the people in Asia now,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.892
almost all of the clean air gains
and the toxic air gains

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.788
that we've achieved here in California

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:38.728
have been wiped out
by dirty air coming over from Asia.

00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.637
So we all are being hit.
We all are being impacted.

00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:45.415
It's just that the poor people
get it first and worst.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.630
But the dirty production,
the burning of toxins,

00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.914
the lack of environmental
standards in Asia,

00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:53.431
is actually creating so much
dirty air pollution,

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:54.872
it's coming across the ocean,

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.010
and has erased our gains
here in California.

00:05:57.034 --> 00:05:58.928
We're back where we were in the 1970s.

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:00.879
And so we're on one planet,

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:03.848
and we have to be able to get
to the root of these problems.

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:06.930
The root of this problem, in my view,

00:06:06.954 --> 00:06:09.459
is the idea of disposability itself.

00:06:09.998 --> 00:06:13.019
You see, if you understand the link

00:06:13.043 --> 00:06:16.771
between what we're doing
to poison and pollute the planet

00:06:16.795 --> 00:06:19.236
and what we're doing to poor people,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.394
you arrive at a very troubling
but also very helpful insight:

00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:26.544
In order to trash the planet,

00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:28.235
you have to trash people.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:31.723
But if you create a world
where you don't trash people,

00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:33.236
you can't trash the planet.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.026
So now we are at a moment

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.898
where the coming together
of social justice as an idea

00:06:38.922 --> 00:06:40.536
and ecology as an idea,

00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:42.656
we finally can now see

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.245
that they are really,
at the end of the day, one idea.

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:48.156
And it's the idea that we don't have
disposable anything.

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:51.065
We don't have disposable resources.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.191
We don't have disposable species.

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.771
And we don't have
disposable people, either.

00:06:56.795 --> 00:06:58.817
We don't have a throwaway planet,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:01.632
and we don't have throwaway
children -- it's all precious.

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:04.536
And as we all begin to come back
to that basic understanding,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.536
new opportunities for action
begin to emerge.

00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:09.826
Biomimicry,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.367
which is an emerging science,

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.536
winds up being a very important
social justice idea.

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:19.188
People who are just
learning about this stuff:

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:22.798
biomimicry means respecting
the wisdom of all species.

00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:24.375
Democracy, by the way,

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.406
means respecting the wisdom
of all people -- we'll get to that.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.216
But biomimicry means
respecting the wisdom of all species.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.750
It turns out we're a pretty
clever species.

00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:35.853
We have this big cortex,
we're pretty proud of ourselves.

00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:38.440
But if we want to make something hard,

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:40.978
we say, "I know! I'm going
to make a hard substance.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.536
I know! I'm going to get
vacuums and furnaces

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.244
and drag stuff out of the ground

00:07:46.268 --> 00:07:49.157
and get things hot
and poison and pollute ...

00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:51.402
But I got this hard thing!"

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:53.214
(Laughter)

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:54.837
"I'm so clever!"

00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.906
And you look behind you,
and there's destruction all around you.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.083
But guess what?

00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.653
You're so clever,
but you're not as clever as a clam.

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:03.201
A clamshell is hard.

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:06.389
There's no vacuums.
There's no big furnaces.

00:08:06.413 --> 00:08:08.353
There's no poison. There's no pollution.

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:13.177
It turns out that other species
figured out a long time ago

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.536
how to create many of the things we need

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.536
using biological processes
that nature knows how to use well.

00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:22.898
That insight of biomimicry,
of our scientists finally realizing

00:08:22.922 --> 00:08:25.330
that we have as much
to learn from other species --

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.536
I don't mean taking a mouse
and sticking it with stuff.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.869
I don't mean looking at it from that way,
abusing the little species.

00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:35.149
I mean actually respecting them,
respecting what they've achieved.

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:36.730
That's called biomimicry,

00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:40.627
and that opens the door
to zero waste production;

00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:42.536
zero pollution production;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.536
that we could actually enjoy

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.181
a high quality of life,
a high standard of living,

00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:48.776
without trashing the planet.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.840
Well, that idea of biomimicry,

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.752
respecting the wisdom of all species,

00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:58.098
combined with the idea
of democracy and social justice,

00:08:58.122 --> 00:09:00.717
respecting the wisdom
and the worth of all people,

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.536
would give us a different society.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.432
We would have a different economy.

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:06.766
We would have a green society

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.195
that Dr. King would be proud of.

00:09:09.219 --> 00:09:10.536
That should be the goal.

00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:13.861
And the way that we get there
is to first of all recognize

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:15.969
that the idea of disposability

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:20.936
not only hurts the species
we've talked about,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.711
but it even corrupts our own society.

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:26.712
We're so proud to live here in California.

00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:28.822
We just had this vote,
and everybody's like,

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:30.584
"Well -- not in our state!"

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.129
(Laughter)

00:09:32.153 --> 00:09:34.936
I don't know what those
other states were doing, but ..."

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.702
(Laughter)

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.325
Just so proud.

00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:41.672
And, yeah, I'm proud, too.

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:42.868
But ...

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.936
California, though we lead the world
in some of the green stuff,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.936
we also, unfortunately, lead the world

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.500
in some of the gulag stuff.

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:56.206
California has one of the highest
incarceration rates

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.936
of all the 50 states.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.196
We have a moral challenge
in this movement.

00:10:01.077 --> 00:10:06.097
We are passionate about rescuing
some dead materials from the landfill,

00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:07.937
but sometimes not as passionate

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:10.279
about rescuing living beings,
living people.

00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:13.793
And I would say
that we live in a country --

00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:15.794
five percent of the world's population,

00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.684
25 percent of the greenhouse gases,

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:20.567
but also 25 percent
of the world's prisoners.

00:10:21.344 --> 00:10:24.004
One of every four people
locked up anywhere in the world

00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:26.202
is locked up right here
in the United States.

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.936
So that is consistent with this idea

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.596
that disposability
is something we believe in.

00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:33.335
And yet,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.022
as a movement that has to broaden
its constituency,

00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:40.357
that has to grow,

00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.483
that has to reach out
beyond our natural comfort zone,

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:46.420
one of the challenges
to the success of this movement,

00:10:46.444 --> 00:10:49.684
of getting rid of things like plastic
and helping the economy shift,

00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:52.655
is people look at our movement
with some suspicion.

00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:55.720
And they ask a question,
and the question is:

00:10:55.744 --> 00:10:57.711
How can these people be so passionate?

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:01.745
A poor person, a low-income person,
somebody in Cancer Alley,

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:04.203
somebody in Watts,

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:06.936
somebody in Harlem,
somebody on an Indian reservation,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.178
might say to themselves --
and rightfully so --

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:11.219
"How can these people be so passionate

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:13.849
about making sure

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:17.936
that a plastic bottle
has a second chance in life,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.703
or an aluminum can has a second chance,

00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:24.737
and yet, when my child gets in trouble
and goes to prison,

00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:26.570
he doesn't get a second chance?"

00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:29.076
"How can this movement
be so passionate about saying

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.920
we don't have throwaway stuff,
no throwaway dead materials,

00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:34.759
and yet accept throwaway lives

00:11:34.783 --> 00:11:37.100
and throwaway communities
like Cancer Alley?"

00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:42.145
And so, we now get a chance
to be truly proud of this movement.

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:44.385
When we take on topics like this,

00:11:44.409 --> 00:11:49.041
it gives us that extra call
to reach out to other movements

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.407
and to become more inclusive and to grow,

00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:54.668
and we can finally get out of
this crazy dilemma that we've been in.

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:57.340
Most of you are good, softhearted people.

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:01.305
When you were younger,
you cared about the whole world,

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:04.225
and at some point, somebody said
you had to pick an issue,

00:12:05.098 --> 00:12:07.169
you had to boil your love
down to an issue.

00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:09.065
"Can't love the whole world --

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:12.683
you've got to work on trees
or you've got to work on immigration.

00:12:12.707 --> 00:12:15.611
You've got to shrink it down
and be about one issue."

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.795
And really, they fundamentally told you,

00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:20.105
"Are you going to hug a tree?

00:12:20.713 --> 00:12:22.840
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.

00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:24.476
Are you going to hug a tree?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.569
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick."

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:29.045
Well, when you start working
on issues like plastic,

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:31.268
you realize the whole thing is connected.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.072
And luckily, most of us are blessed
to have two arms --

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:35.487
we can hug both.

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:36.880
Thank you very much.

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:43.815
(Applause)
