00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
and usually what I’m talking about

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.160
and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.160
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
it is not requisite to know how to make it.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160
in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning;

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
who, by a strange inversion of reasoning,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.160
to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.160
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
"Test Two:

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.160
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
You would have thought it stands to reason

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
that design requires an intelligent designer.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.160
which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.160
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
We adore babies because they’re so cute.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.160
And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.160
This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160
to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.160
Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.160
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
So if you think first there was sweetness,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
and then we evolved to like sweetness,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.160
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
then Mother Nature would have a problem:

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.160
How on earth do you get chimps to mate?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.160
Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Just wire the chimps up to love that look,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
and apparently they do.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
That’s all there is to it.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
We became bald-bodied, oddly enough;

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
for one reason or another, they didn’t.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:39.160
If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
who did his famous experiments with gulls,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak --

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
if he made a bigger, oranger spot

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
What we see with, say, chocolate cake

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160
And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here’s a pretty good example.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.160
It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.160
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
So nature works on many levels here.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find --

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.160
we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
This is the strange inversion.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
This is the hard one, the one that isn’t obvious. That’s why I leave it to the end.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And I won’t be able to say too much about it.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.160
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done --

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it --

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.160
is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.160
for doing a grubby clerical job.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Our bumper sticker for this view is

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
that this is the joy of debugging.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:10.160
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.160
by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke --

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ...

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny --

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
in this way, we can actually learn something

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
about the architecture of the brain,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
the functional architecture of the brain.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.160
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.160
He’s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
and we’re putting this together into a book.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
Thank you very much.
