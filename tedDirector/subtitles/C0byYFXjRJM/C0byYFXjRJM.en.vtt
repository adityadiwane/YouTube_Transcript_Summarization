00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.015
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.388
started out the way most things do:

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:21.911
without me, and not online.

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.819
On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.654
Alfred Nobel, died.

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.910
One hundred years later, exactly, actually,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.476
December 10, 1996,

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.475
this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.636
won the Nobel Prize for literature.

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.277
She's a Polish poet.

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:37.525
She's a big deal, obviously,

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.164
but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:41.683
and when I checked out her work,

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:43.179
I found this sweet little poem,

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:44.780
"Four in the Morning."

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.045
"The hour from night to day.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.431
The hour from side to side.

00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.229
The hour for those past thirty..."

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.316
And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:53.239
I fell for it hard,

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.180
so hard, I suspected we must have met

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.593
somewhere before.

00:00:57.593 --> 00:00:59.892
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.412
Did I flirt with this poem

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:02.557
in a coffee shop somewhere?

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:04.069
I could not place it, and it bugged me,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.971
and then in the coming week or two,

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.420
I would just be watching an old movie,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.702
and this would happen.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.965
(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you
should have come to the first party.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.317
We didn't get home till around four in the morning.

00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:14.589
Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,

00:01:14.589 --> 00:01:16.271
and this would happen.

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.890
(Music: Seinfeld theme)

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.671
(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, 
I was up til four in the morning

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.360
watching that Omen trilogy.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.597
Rives: I would be listening to music,

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:25.124
and this would happen.

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:27.938
(Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clock
in the morning, damn it. ♪

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:30.139
Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.130
Obviously, the demigods of coincidence

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.818
were just messing with me.

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:36.309
Some people get a number stuck in their head,

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:38.914
you may recognize a certain name or a tune,

00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:40.699
some people get nothing, but four in the morning

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.600
was in me now, but mildly,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.114
like a groin injury.

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:47.586
I always assumed it would just go away

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.095
on its own eventually,

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:50.681
and I never talked about it with anybody,

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:54.233
but it did not, and I totally did.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.314
In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED

00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:57.230
for the second time,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.732
and since I was still an authority on nothing,

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:03.123
I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.711
on a topic so niche

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.558
it is actually inconsequential

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:07.971
or actually cockamamie.

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.147
So my talk had some of my
four in the morning examples,

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.525
but it also had examples

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:14.581
from my fellow TED speakers that year.

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.035
I found four in the morning in a novel

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.311
by Isabel Allende.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.842
I found a really great one

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:20.998
in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.

00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:22.643
I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.080
although Matt Groening told me later

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.898
that he could not make my talk

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:26.662
because it was a morning session

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:29.382
and I gather that he is not an early riser.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.970
However, had Matt been there,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.948
he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:38.563
that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.

00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:39.724
It was totally contrived

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.740
just for that room, just for that moment.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.897
That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.556
It was fun. That was pretty much it.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:49.531
When I got home, though,
the emails started coming in

00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:50.970
from people who had seen the talk live,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.264
beginning with, and this is still my favorite,

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:54.931
"Here's another one for your collection:

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.571
'It's the friends you can call
up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"

00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.411
The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.392
The email itself was from another very

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:04.453
sexy European type,

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:06.941
TED Curator Chris Anderson.

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.353
(Laughter)

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:09.805
Chris found this quote

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.207
on a coffee cup or something,

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.670
and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.809
of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.024
I am contagious,

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:20.031
which was confirmed less than a week later

00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:22.070
when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.312
an actual greeting card

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:24.692
with that same quotation.

00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:27.929
As a bonus, she hooked me up
with a second one they make.

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.549
It says, "Just knowing I can call you

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.964
at four in the morning if I need to

00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:32.012
makes me not really need to,"

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.685
which I love, because together these are like,

00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:35.375
"Hallmark: When you care enough

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.438
to send the very best twice,

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:39.406
phrased slightly differently."

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.338
I was not surprised at the TEDster

00:03:43.338 --> 00:03:45.050
and New Yorker magazine overlap.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.075
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:50.135
"It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleep
better if you bought some crap."

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:53.877
I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.

00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.637
More than one person sent me this.

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:57.516
(Video) Didi Pickles: It's
four o'clock in the morning.

00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:59.748
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?

00:03:59.748 --> 00:04:01.884
Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:04.010
(Laughter)

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.607
Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.487
who was disgruntled I had overlooked

00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:09.503
what he considers to be a classic.

00:04:09.503 --> 00:04:12.422
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.
Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?

00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:15.847
Roy: No, it's not an accident. You
wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:17.983
Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:19.177
Rives: So that's "Close Encounters,"

00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:20.501
and the main character is all worked up

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.017
because aliens, momentously,

00:04:22.017 --> 00:04:23.539
have chosen to show themselves to earthlings

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.565
at four in the morning,

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.319
which does make that a very solid example.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.343
Those were all really solid examples.

00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:30.310
They did not get me any closer to understanding

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.911
why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.

00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.999
But they followed the pattern. They played along.

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.783
Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:39.553
when all these dramatic occurrences

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:41.919
allegedly occur.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.591
Maybe this was some kind of cliche

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.439
that had never been taxonomized before.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.189
Maybe I was on the trail

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.255
of a new meme or something.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:51.027
Just when things were getting pretty interesting,

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:52.636
things got really interesting.

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:54.991
TED.com launched, later that year,

00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:56.823
with a bunch of videos from past talks,

00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:57.723
including mine,

00:04:57.723 --> 00:05:00.597
and I started receiving "four in the morning" citations

00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:03.160
from what seemed like every
time zone on the planet.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.871
Much of it was content I never would have found

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.295
on my own if I was looking for it,

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:08.833
and I was not.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.480
I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.110
I probably would have missed the booklet,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.647
"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.570
(Laughter)

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.475
I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:23.967
although it looks delightful. (Laughter)

00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:25.279
Take note of those clock ends.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.619
This is a college student's suggestion

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.285
for what a "four in the morning" gang sign

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:30.639
should look like.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.727
People sent me magazine ads.

00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:34.810
They took photographs in grocery stores.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.277
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.

00:05:38.277 --> 00:05:39.981
A lot of good quality work, too:

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:41.650
"The Sandman," "Watchmen."

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.081
There's a very cute example
here from "Calvin and Hobbes."

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:47.186
In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in

00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.621
was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.

00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:51.283
Take a look.

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.170
(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.287
Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.

00:05:56.287 --> 00:05:58.007
Rives: And the flip side of the timeline,

00:05:58.007 --> 00:05:59.572
this is from the 31st century.

00:05:59.572 --> 00:06:00.769
A thousand years from now,

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:03.565
people are still doing this.

00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:06.105
(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.

00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:07.192
(Laughter)

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:08.386
Rives: It shows the spectrum.

00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:12.220
I received so many songs, TV shows, movies,

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.400
like from dismal to famous,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.362
I could give you a four-hour playlist.

00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:18.736
If I just stick to modern male movie stars,

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:19.932
I keep it to the length

00:06:19.932 --> 00:06:21.268
of about a commercial.

00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:22.998
Here's your sampler.

00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:25.924
(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.")

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:52.384
(Laughter)

00:06:52.384 --> 00:06:54.526
Rives: So somewhere along the line,

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.272
I realized I have a hobby

00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:58.290
I didn't know I wanted,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.960
and it is crowdsourced.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.322
But I was also thinking what you might be thinking,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.944
which is really, couldn't you do this

00:07:04.944 --> 00:07:06.050
with any hour of the day?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.688
First of all, you are not getting clips like that

00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.272
about four in the afternoon.

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:10.976
Secondly, I did a little research.

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:12.448
You know, I was kind of interested.

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:14.656
If this is confirmation bias,

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:17.267
there is so much confirmation, I am biased.

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:18.513
Literature probably shows it best.

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:20.657
There are a couple three in
the mornings in Shakespeare.

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.000
There's a five in the morning.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.388
There are seven four in the mornings,

00:07:23.388 --> 00:07:24.241
and they're all very dire.

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:27.592
In "Measure for Measure," it's
the call time for the executioner.

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:30.488
Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:32.320
at four in the morning right before battle

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.030
in "War and Peace."

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.746
Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:36.875
a pivotal four in the morning,

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:40.103
as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."

00:07:40.103 --> 00:07:43.301
"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.

00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:47.033
"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:50.130
Someone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man."

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.241
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."

00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:55.641
"The Great Gatsby" spends the last

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.251
four in the morning of his life

00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.449
waiting for a lover who never shows,

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:02.080
and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.569
"The Metamorphosis."

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.721
First paragraph, the main character wakes up

00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.761
transformed into a giant cockroach,

00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:10.967
but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,

00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:12.890
something is up with this guy.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.810
Why? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.159
What kind of person would do that?

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:21.178
This kind of person would do that.

00:08:21.178 --> 00:08:25.490
(Music)

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.784
(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:33.395
(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.
Time for the morning news.

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:34.649
But of course, there is no news yet.

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:37.974
Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.

00:08:37.974 --> 00:08:39.474
Rives: Exactly.

00:08:39.474 --> 00:08:41.404
So that's Lucy from the Peanuts,

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:43.800
"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.516
Nelson Mandela, first day in office,

00:08:45.516 --> 00:08:48.235
and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach

00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:50.804
would give you one hell of a dinner party

00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:52.730
and gives me yet another category,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.350
people waking up, in my big old database.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.780
Just imagine that your friends and your family

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.996
have heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:02.259
and they send them to you.

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:05.108
Even if you don't really, at a certain point,

00:09:05.108 --> 00:09:08.148
you totally collect stuffed polar bears,

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:10.710
and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.422
And when I got to that point, I embraced it.

00:09:12.422 --> 00:09:15.146
I got my curator on. I started fact checking,

00:09:15.146 --> 00:09:18.289
downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:19.660
I started archiving.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.847
My hobby had become a habit,

00:09:21.847 --> 00:09:24.573
and my habit gave me possibly the world's

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:27.421
most eclectic Netflix queue.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.311
At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"

00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:31.699
"Last Tango in Paris,"

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:32.949
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.623
"Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."

00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:36.523
Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?

00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:39.183
Because someone told me I
would find this clip in there.

00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:40.647
(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:42.415
in Flushing, Queens

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.183
on March, 12, 1953,

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:47.080
at four o'clock in the morning.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.800
Rives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.693
Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,

00:09:51.693 --> 00:09:54.269
it also answers the question,

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:56.579
"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir

00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:58.701
have in common?"

00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:01.157
Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:03.365
with the sentence, "I was born
at four o'clock in the morning,"

00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:05.541
which I had because someone
else had emailed it to me,

00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:08.170
and when they did, I had another bump up

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.390
in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.057
and feminist Simone de Beauvoir

00:10:13.057 --> 00:10:14.309
are not just different people.

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:17.189
They are different people that
have this thing connecting them,

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:20.586
and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:23.213
or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,

00:10:23.213 --> 00:10:25.070
is there maybe a cooler way to do this?

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.582
So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:31.796
I put the entire collection online

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:33.428
as "Museum of Four in the Morning."

00:10:33.428 --> 00:10:35.426
You can click on that red "refresh" button.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.710
It will take you at random to one of

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.008
hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.

00:10:40.008 --> 00:10:41.656
Here is a knockout poem

00:10:41.656 --> 00:10:44.149
by Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:45.514
(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:47.194
in the middle of the night

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:49.751
to look up the date of a famous battle

00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:51.380
in a book on war.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.130
No wonder the moon in the window

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.878
seems to have drifted out of a love poem

00:10:56.878 --> 00:10:59.798
that you used to know by heart.

00:10:59.798 --> 00:11:03.190
Rives: So the first hour of this project

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.222
was satisfying.

00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:08.922
A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.

00:11:08.922 --> 00:11:11.166
Half a globe away, a teenager

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:13.566
made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:14.910
a stranger.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.088
Less than a week later, though,

00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:19.344
I received a little bit of grace.

00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:23.606
I received a poignant tweet.

00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:25.528
It was brief.

00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:29.670
It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.268
The name was a pseudonym,
actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.

00:11:32.268 --> 00:11:35.200
As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.366
I knew immediately, my whole body knew

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:40.006
immediately who this was,

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:42.200
and I knew immediately

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.262
what mix tape she was talking about.

00:11:45.262 --> 00:11:48.771
(Music)

00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:51.044
L.D. was my college romance.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.841
This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.

00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:57.159
She was a grad student in the
library sciences department.

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:59.232
Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,

00:11:59.232 --> 00:12:01.408
lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:03.170
She was already smoking hot,

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.560
she was super dorky,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.922
and we had a December-May romance,

00:12:06.922 --> 00:12:08.840
meaning we started dating in December,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.135
and by May, she had graduated

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:14.581
and became my one that got away.

00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:18.728
But her mix tape did not get away.

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:21.584
I have kept this mix tape in a box

00:12:21.584 --> 00:12:24.311
with notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:27.000
from my life, but for decades.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.310
It's the kind of box where,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.428
if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,

00:12:30.428 --> 00:12:32.138
and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,

00:12:32.138 --> 00:12:35.504
but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:37.392
is there are seven songs per side,

00:12:37.392 --> 00:12:39.448
but no song titles.

00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:42.720
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.439
classification system, including page numbers,

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:47.664
to leave me clues.

00:12:47.664 --> 00:12:49.296
When I got this mix tape,

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:50.928
I put it in my cassette player,

00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:54.312
I took it to the campus library, her library,

00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:56.160
I found 14 books on the shelves.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.582
I remember bringing them all

00:12:57.582 --> 00:12:59.186
to my favorite corner table,

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:03.199
and I read poems paired to songs

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.860
like food to wine,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.800
paired, I can tell you,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.583
like saddle shoes

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.589
to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:13.993
I did this again last October.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.115
I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,

00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:18.677
old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind

00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:20.771
of extravagance I used to take for granted

00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.787
even when I was extravagant.

00:13:22.787 --> 00:13:26.212
And then I thought, "Good for him."

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:29.555
"PG" is Slavic literature.

00:13:29.555 --> 00:13:32.603
"7000" series Polish literature.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.253
Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.

00:13:35.253 --> 00:13:38.402
Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.620
paired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.065
(Music: Paul Simon, "Peace Like a River")

00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:45.961
(Video) Paul Simon: ♪ Oh, four in the morning ♪

00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:51.323
♪ I woke up from out of my dream ♪

00:13:51.323 --> 00:13:55.723
Rives: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause)
