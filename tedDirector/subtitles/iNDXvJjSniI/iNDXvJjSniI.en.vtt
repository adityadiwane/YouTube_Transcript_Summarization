00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:16.800
In the ocean,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.640
what is the common point

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.408
between oil, plastic and radioactivity?

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:29.625
On the top line, this is the BP oil spill:

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.648
billions of barrels of oil gushing

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.017
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:35.192
The middle line is millions of tons of

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:37.596
plastic debris accumulating in our ocean,

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:40.316
and the third line is radioactive material

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:42.612
leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:43.950
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.533
Well, the three big problems have in common

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.348
that they are man-made problems

00:00:51.348 --> 00:00:53.404
but they are controlled by natural forces.

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:57.812
This should make us feel very, terribly awful

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:00.139
as much as it should make us feel hopeful,

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.948
because if we have the power to create these problems,

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.628
we may as well have the power

00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:06.060
to remediate these problems.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.004
But what about natural forces?

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.987
Well, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.292
is how we can use these natural forces

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:18.515
to remediate these man-made problems.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:19.741
When the BP oil spill happened,

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.506
I was working at MIT, and I was in charge

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:24.903
of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.

00:01:24.903 --> 00:01:28.316
And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.653
and meet some fishermen and see

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.444
the terrible conditions in which they were working.

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:35.525
More than 700 of these boats,

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.832
which are fishermen boats repurposed

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.293
with oil absorbent in white

00:01:40.293 --> 00:01:42.688
and oil containment in orange, were used,

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:45.947
but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:47.659
and the health of the cleaners

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.572
were very deeply affected.

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:53.566
I was working on a very interesting technology

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.875
at MIT, but it was a very long-term view

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.309
of how to develop technology,

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:59.827
and it was going to be a very expensive technology,

00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:02.275
and also it would be patented.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:04.907
So I wanted to develop something that we could

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:08.307
develop very fast, that would be cheap,

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:10.747
and that would be open-source, so, because

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:12.915
oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:15.531
and that would be using renewable energy.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.931
So I quit my dream job,

00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:19.547
and I moved to New Orleans,

00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:22.491
and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.563
Currently, what they were doing is

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:26.209
that they were using these small fishing boats,

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.369
and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.082
If you're using the exact same amount of surface

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.235
of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:37.568
to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:39.336
you can collect a lot more material.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:41.457
If you're multiplying the rig,

00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:44.032
so you multiply how many layers of absorbent

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:45.934
you're using, you can collect a lot more.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.535
But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.167
against the winds, the surface currents and the waves.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:53.631
These are enormous forces.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:56.654
So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:58.907
of sailing and tacking of the wind

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.525
to capture or intercept the oil

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:02.867
that is drifting down the wind.

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:06.364
So this didn't require any invention.

00:03:06.364 --> 00:03:08.067
We just took a simple sailing boat

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:09.964
and we tried to pull something long and heavy,

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:12.276
but as we tacked back and forth,

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:13.947
what we lost was two things:

00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:17.324
we were losing pulling power and direction.

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:21.156
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:22.668
from the back of the boat to the front,

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.411
would we have better control?

00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:26.627
So I built this small sailing robot

00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:27.875
with the rudder at the front,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.340
and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.547
so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.459
and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.811
I could control four meters of absorbent.

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:42.627
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,

00:03:42.627 --> 00:03:45.091
and so you see the robot has

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.763
a front rudder here.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.979
Normally it's at the back.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.594
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:52.874
of this was really amazing,

00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:54.802
and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:56.474
more maneuverable than a normal boat.

00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:59.338
Then I started publishing online, and

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:02.250
some friends from Korea, they started being

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.979
interested in this, and we made a boat

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.787
which has a front rudder and a back rudder,

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.845
so we started interacting with this,

00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:09.964
and it was slightly better,

00:04:09.964 --> 00:04:11.888
although it was very small and a bit off balance,

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:12.968
but then we thought,

00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.856
what if we have more than two points of control?

00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.848
What if the entire boat becomes a point of control?

00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:18.968
What if the entire boat changes shape?

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:21.408
So â€” (Applause)

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:23.304
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.889
And so that's the beginning of Protei,

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.528
and that's the first boat in history

00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:29.152
that completely changed the shape of the hull

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:30.322
in order to control it,

00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:33.208
and the properties of sailing that we get

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:36.106
are very superior compared to a normal boat.

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:38.760
When we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.876
and the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.

00:04:42.876 --> 00:04:45.576
This is low speed, low wind speed,

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.649
and the maneuverability is very increased,

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:49.960
and here I'm going to do a small jibe,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.056
and look at the position of the sail.

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:55.656
What's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:57.996
the position of the front sail and the main sail

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.173
are different to the wind.

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.056
We're catching wind from both sides.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:03.315
And this is exactly what we're looking [for]

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:05.099
if we want to pull something long and heavy.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.488
We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.

00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:10.328
So, I wanted to know if this was possible

00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:11.799
to put this at an industrial level,

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:14.311
so we made a large boat with a large sail,

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:17.007
and with a very light hull, inflatable,

00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:18.512
very small footprint,

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:21.336
so we have a very big size and power ratio.

00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:24.567
After this, we wanted to see if we could

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:26.864
implement this and automate the system,

00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:28.536
so we used the same system but we added

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.906
a structure to it so we could activate the machine.

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:34.120
So, we used the same bladder-inflated system,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.104
and we took it for testing.

00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:38.415
So this is happening in the Netherlands.

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:40.946
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:43.517
just to see how it works.

00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:46.202
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it,

00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:49.104
but quickly we saw that we would need

00:05:49.104 --> 00:05:51.253
a lot more weight at the bottom,

00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:52.790
so we had to take it back to the lab,

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.878
and then we built a skin around it,

00:05:54.878 --> 00:05:58.165
we put batteries, remote controllers, and then

00:05:58.165 --> 00:05:59.613
we put it in the water and then we

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:02.774
let it go in the water and see how well it would work,

00:06:02.774 --> 00:06:06.198
so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:09.421
and it worked okay, but we still have a long way.

00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:11.857
Our small prototype has given us good insight

00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:13.203
that it's working very well,

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:15.888
but we still need to work a lot more on this.

00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:19.757
So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution

00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:21.205
of sailing technology.

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:23.132
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.143
to two rudders to multiple rudders

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:26.814
to the whole boat changing shape,

00:06:26.814 --> 00:06:28.670
and the more we are moving forward,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.717
and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.094
But I wanted to show you a fish because --

00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:40.164
In fact, it's very different from a fish.

00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:44.564
A fish will move because -- by changing like this,

00:06:44.564 --> 00:06:47.663
but our boat is propelled by the wind still,

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:50.070
and the hull controls the trajectory.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.724
So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage

00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:56.109
Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one,

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:58.358
but it's a good one for making demos.

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:00.634
So the first thing as I show you in the video is

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:04.621
that we may be able to control the trajectory

00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:06.085
of a sailing boat better,

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:09.146
or we may be able to never be in irons,

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:10.446
so never facing the wind,

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:12.561
we always can catch the wind from both sides.

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:15.121
But new properties of a sailing boat.

00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:19.377
So if you're looking at the boat from this side,

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:21.585
this might remind you of an airplane profile.

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:23.998
An airplane, when you're moving in this direction,

00:07:23.998 --> 00:07:26.263
starts to lift, and that's how it takes off.

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:28.438
Now, if you're taking the same system,

00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:30.806
and you're putting vertical, you're bending,

00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:32.806
and if you're moving this way forward,

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:35.933
your instinct will tell you that you might go this way,

00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:37.740
but if you're moving fast enough,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.759
you might create what we call lateral lift,

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.684
so we could get further or closer to the wind.

00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:45.628
Other property is this:

00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:48.789
A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:50.781
and a rudder at the back,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.331
and these two things are what creates most

00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.985
resistance and turbulence behind the boat,

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:58.256
but because this doesn't have either

00:07:58.256 --> 00:07:59.792
a centerboard or a rudder,

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:02.664
we hope that if we keep working on this hull design

00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:04.856
we can improve and have less resistance.

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:07.511
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach

00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:09.735
a certain speed, and they are going on waves,

00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:12.174
they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,

00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:15.471
and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.

00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.559
But if we're going with the flow,

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:19.695
if we pay attention to natural patterns

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.306
instead of trying to be strong,

00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:23.705
but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb

00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:26.902
a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:30.059
to actually save some energy to move forward.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:34.210
So we may have developed the technology

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.877
which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,

00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:41.094
but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology

00:08:41.094 --> 00:08:43.040
if it doesn't reach the right hands?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.986
Normal technology or innovation happens like this:

00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:48.416
Somebody has an interesting idea,

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:50.378
some other scientist or engineer,

00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:52.882
they take it to the next level, they make a theory about it

00:08:52.882 --> 00:08:54.138
and maybe they patent it,

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:56.674
and then some industry will make a contract

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:59.818
of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,

00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:01.914
and then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,

00:09:01.914 --> 00:09:04.682
and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.

00:09:04.682 --> 00:09:08.378
What we really want is that this innovation happens

00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:10.714
continuously. The inventor and engineers

00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:12.450
and also the manufacturers and everybody

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.834
works at the same time, but this would be sterile

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:18.466
if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.

00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:20.506
What you really want is not a sequential,

00:09:20.506 --> 00:09:21.898
not parallel development.

00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:23.507
You want to have a network of innovation.

00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:25.586
You want everybody, like we're doing now,

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:28.755
to work at the same time, and that can only happen

00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:32.146
if these people all together decide to share the information,

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:35.086
and that's exactly what open hardware is about.

00:09:35.086 --> 00:09:38.755
It's to replace competition by collaboration.

00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:42.906
It's to transform any new product into a new market.

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:45.347
So what is open hardware?

00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:47.130
Essentially, open hardware is a license.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.202
It's just an intellectual property setup.

00:09:49.202 --> 00:09:52.226
It means that everybody is free to use,

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:55.379
modify and distribute, and in exchange

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:56.657
we only ask for two things:

00:09:56.657 --> 00:09:58.752
The name is credited -- the name of the project --

00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:01.488
and also the people who make improvement,

00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:02.816
they share back with the community.

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:04.152
So it's a very simple condition.

00:10:04.152 --> 00:10:08.176
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,

00:10:08.176 --> 00:10:10.352
but quickly after I wanted to publish and share

00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:12.096
this information, so I made a Kickstarter,

00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:14.336
which is a crowd-fundraising platform,

00:10:14.336 --> 00:10:16.768
and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.

00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:20.080
With this money, I hired a team of young engineers

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.608
from all over the world, and we rented a factory

00:10:22.608 --> 00:10:24.128
in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

00:10:24.128 --> 00:10:27.289
We were peer-learning, we were engineering,

00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:30.472
we were making things, prototyping,

00:10:30.472 --> 00:10:32.697
but most importantly we were trying our prototypes

00:10:32.697 --> 00:10:34.392
in the water as often as possible,

00:10:34.392 --> 00:10:37.544
to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.

00:10:37.544 --> 00:10:40.056
This is a proud member of Protei from Korea,

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.516
and on the right side, this is a multiple-masts

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:44.449
design proposed by a team in Mexico.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:47.634
This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine

00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:50.229
in New York, and so she decided to prototype

00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:52.759
this idea that she saw, and she documented

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.188
every step of the process,

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:56.437
and she published it on Instructables,

00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:58.669
which is a website for sharing inventions.

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:00.564
Less than one week after,

00:11:00.564 --> 00:11:04.574
this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.

00:11:04.574 --> 00:11:06.904
They made it, but they eventually published

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:08.028
a simplified design.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:09.957
They also made it into an Instructable,

00:11:09.957 --> 00:11:11.692
and in less than one week, they had

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:14.452
almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:17.356
We're working on also simpler technology,

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:19.307
not that complex, with younger people

00:11:19.307 --> 00:11:20.876
and also older people,

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:24.027
like this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)

00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:26.844
So Protei is now an international network

00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:29.692
of innovation for selling technology

00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:31.484
using this shape-shifting hull.

00:11:31.484 --> 00:11:35.519
And what puts us together is that we have a common,

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:38.308
at least, global understanding

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:41.380
of what the word "business" is, or what it should be.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.613
This is how most work today.

00:11:43.613 --> 00:11:45.987
Business as usual is saying, what's most important

00:11:45.987 --> 00:11:48.226
is to make lots of profit, and you'll be using

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:51.051
technology for that, and people will be your work force,

00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:52.299
instrumentalized,

00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:54.971
and environment is usually the last priority.

00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:58.849
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:01.080
and, say, increase your price tag.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.609
What we're trying to do, or what we believe,

00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:06.025
because this is how we believe the world really works,

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.195
is that without the environment you have nothing.

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:11.080
We have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.744
and we're a technology company,

00:12:12.744 --> 00:12:17.929
and profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)

00:12:17.929 --> 00:12:21.534
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:25.615
If we have the courage to understand or accept

00:12:25.615 --> 00:12:27.535
that this actually how the world really works,

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:30.552
and this is the order of priority that we need to choose,

00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:32.693
then it makes obvious why we need

00:12:32.693 --> 00:12:35.032
to choose open hardware for developing environmental

00:12:35.032 --> 00:12:36.912
technology, because we need to share information.

00:12:36.912 --> 00:12:38.992
What's next for us?

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:41.527
So, this small machine that you've seen,

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:43.671
we're hoping to make small toys like

00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:47.164
one-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade --

00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:50.150
so replace the remote control parts by Androids,

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.929
so the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:55.152
so you could be controlling this

00:12:55.152 --> 00:12:56.640
from your mobile phone, your tablet.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.206
Then what we want to do is create six-meter versions

00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:02.534
so we can test the maximum performance of these machines,

00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:04.098
so we can go at very, very high speed.

00:13:04.098 --> 00:13:05.361
So imagine yourself.

00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:08.546
You are laying down in a flexible torpedo,

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:10.040
sailing at high speed,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.885
controlling the shape of the hull with your legs

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:14.547
and controlling the sail with your arms.

00:13:14.547 --> 00:13:18.872
So that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)

00:13:18.872 --> 00:13:21.086
And we replace the human being --

00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:23.230
to go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.409
you don't want a human to be sailing those robots --

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:28.744
with batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.

00:13:28.744 --> 00:13:32.678
This is what our teammates, we dream of at night.

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.330
We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.307
or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,

00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:42.741
or we can have swarms of our machines

00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:45.923
controlled by multi-player video game engines

00:13:45.923 --> 00:13:47.874
to control many of these machines,

00:13:47.874 --> 00:13:49.625
to monitor coral reefs

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.764
or to monitor fisheries.

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:56.254
Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:59.785
to better understand and protect our oceans.

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:03.497
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:14:03.497 --> 00:14:22.759
(Applause)
