00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:16.180
It's Christmas Eve, 1968.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.756
The Apollo 8 spacecraft
has successfully completed

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
its first three orbits around the moon.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.476
Launched from Cape Canaveral
three days before,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.196
this is the first time

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.940
that humans have ever traveled
beyond low Earth orbit.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.276
On the vessel's fourth pass,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.996
the Earth slowly comes into view

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.980
and reveals itself
above the Moon's horizon.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.436
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically
asks his crewmates where their camera is,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.876
grabs the Hasselblad,
points it towards the window,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.236
presses the shutter,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.380
and takes one of the most
important photographs of all time:

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.580
"Earthrise."

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.196
When the crew was safely home
a few days later,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.840
they were asked about the mission.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.036
Anders famously replied,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.156
"We went to the moon,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.380
but we actually discovered Earth."

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.860
What did he and his fellow crewmates feel

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.060
in this incredible moment?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.196
In a study released just this past year,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.276
a team of researchers
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.916
examined the testimonies
of hundreds of astronauts

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.196
who had the opportunity
to view the Earth from space.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
Their analysis uncovered
three common feelings:

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.796
first, a greater appreciation
for Earth's beauty;

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.916
second, an increased sense
of connection to all other living beings;

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.300
and third, an unexpected,
often overwhelming sense of emotion.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.436
The researchers believe that seeing
the Earth from a great distance

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.396
provokes someone to develop
new cognitive frameworks

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.100
to understand what they are seeing.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.036
They believe these astronauts
were forever changed

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.916
by this new view,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.836
this new perspective,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100
this new visual truth.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.540
This feeling is commonly referred to
as the "overview effect."

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.180
Only 558 people
have ever been to outer space.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.156
558 people had the opportunity

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.316
to gaze down in awe,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.996
to wonder at our planet

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.636
floating in an infinite sea of darkness.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.436
But what if that number were bigger?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.956
Three years ago,
I set off on my own mission:

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.716
to see if I could bring this feeling
of overwhelming scale and beauty

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.396
to many more people

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.476
just by using one small computer

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.700
in my small New York City apartment.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.316
It was then, in 2013,
that I launched "Daily Overview."

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.876
Every day, I have used satellite imagery

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.276
to create one expansive
overhead view of our planet.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.236
More than 1,000 of these images
have been created thus far,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.756
and more than 600,000 people

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.836
tune in for this daily dose
of perspectives.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.956
I create the imagery by curating photos
from the massive archive

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.340
of a satellite company
called Digital Globe.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.676
They operate a constellation
of five satellites,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.316
each roughly the size of an ambulance,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.756
that is constantly
taking pictures of the Earth

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.100
as they orbit at
28,000 kilometers per hour.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.660
Now, what does this mean?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.796
Each of these satellites
is equipped with a camera

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.716
that has a focal length of 16 meters,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.436
so that's roughly 290 times greater

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.780
than a DSLR camera equipped
with a standard 55 millimeter lens.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.076
So if were able to attach
one of their satellites

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.260
to the roof of this theater in Oxford,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.796
we could take a picture of a football,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.900
clearly, on the pitch
at the stadium in Amsterdam.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.420
That's 450 kilometers away.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.316
That's incredibly powerful technology.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.836
And I decided at the beginning
of this project

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.316
that I would use
that incredible technology

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.236
to focus on the places

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.580
where humans have impacted the planet.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.316
As a species, we dig and scrape
the Earth for resources,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.780
we produce energy,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.020
we raise animals
and cultivate crops for food,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.156
we build cities, we move around,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.516
we create waste.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.836
And in the process
of doing all of these things,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.956
we shape landscapes and seascapes

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.940
and cityscapes with increasing
control and impunity.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.716
So with that in mind,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.420
I would like to share
a few of my overviews with you now.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.996
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.780
waiting outside the entry
to the port of Singapore.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.636
This facility is the second-busiest
in the world by terms of total tonnage,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.036
accounting for one-fifth
of the world's shipping containers

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.516
and one half of the annual supply

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.900
of crude oil.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.516
If you look closely at this overview,
you'll see a lot of little specks.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.396
Those are actually cows at a feedlot

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.940
in Summerfield, Texas,
in the United States.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.116
So once cows reach a particular weight,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.276
roughly 300 kilograms,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.100
they are moved here
and placed on a specialized diet.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.916
Over the next three to four months,
the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.076
before they are shipped off to slaughter.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.516
You're also probably wondering
about this glowing pool at the top there.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.396
That gets its color from a unique
combination of manure, chemicals

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.460
and a particular type of algae
that grows in the stagnant water.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.796
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.116
in the Pilbara region
of Western Australia,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.956
a beautiful yet scary scar
on the face of the Earth.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.036
Of the world's mined iron ore,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.996
98 percent is used to make steel

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.316
and is therefore a major component
in the construction of buildings,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.340
automobiles or appliances
such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.940
This is a solar concentrator
in Seville, Spain.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.396
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.476
which are arrayed in concentric circles
around an 140-meter-tall tower

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.740
at its center.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.756
At the top of the tower,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.996
there is a capsule of molten salt

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.636
that gets heated by the beams
of light reflected upwards

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.980
from the mirrors below.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.076
From there, the salt circulates
to a storage tank underground,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.556
where it produces steam,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.036
which spins turbines

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.556
and generates enough electricity
to power 70,000 homes

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.900
and offsets 30,000 tons
of carbon dioxide emissions every year.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.036
This overview shows deforestation
in Santa Cruz, Bolivia

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.940
immediately adjacent
to untouched tracts of rainforest.

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:06.556
Deforestation in the country
has primarily been driven

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.196
by the expansion of mechanized agriculture

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.876
and cattle ranching,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.116
so as the country tries to meet
the demand of its growing population

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.356
and feed them,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.676
the sacrificial destruction
of its rainforest

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.180
has taken place to do so.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.956
It is estimated that the country
lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.436
in one decade alone

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.660
from 2000 until 2010.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.660
This is the Eixample district
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.236
So the overview perspective
can be incredibly helpful

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.276
to help us understand how cities function

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.236
and how we can devise
smarter solutions for urban planning,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.396
and this will become only more relevant

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.916
as it is expected that 4.9 billion people
will live in cities around the world

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.180
by the year 2030.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.276
This area of Barcelona is characterized
by its strict grid pattern,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.316
apartments with communal courtyards

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.516
and these octagonal intersections

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.556
which allow for more sunlight,
better ventilation

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.460
and additional parking at street level.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.740
And here we see that grid pattern
but under much different circumstances.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.796
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp
in northern Kenya,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.756
the largest such facility
of its kind in the world.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.036
To cope with the influx of refugees
who are fleeing Somalia,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.956
where there is famine and conflict,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.476
the UN has built this area
gridded out at left

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.236
called the LFO extension

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.796
to house more and more refugees

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.796
who are arriving and occupying
these white dots,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.156
which are actually tents

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.660
which will slowly fill up
the area over time.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.396
So if you have one of these overviews,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.220
you have a moment in time.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.956
If we have two overviews, however,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.820
we are able to tell stories
about changes in time.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.916
I call that feature
of the project "Juxtapose,"

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.300
and we'll share a few examples
of it with you now.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.380
So the tulip fields in Netherlands
bloom every year in April.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.076
So we take an image
captured in March a few weeks before

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.620
and contrast it to one
taken a few weeks later.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.820
We're able to watch the flowers bloom
in this magnificent cascade of color.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.260
It is estimated that the Dutch produce
4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.076
In 2015, two dams collapsed

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.796
at an iron ore mine
in southeastern Brazil,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.436
causing one of the worst
environmental disasters

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.889
in the history of the country.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.196
It is estimated that 62 million
cubic meters of waste

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.916
were released when the dams broke,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.356
destroying numerous villages
in the process,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.380
including Bento Rodrigues,
seen here before ...

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.780
and after the flood.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.636
Ultimately, 19 people
were killed in this disaster.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.756
Half a million people did not
have access to clean drinking water

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.796
for an extended period of time,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.276
and the waste soon entered
into the Doce River,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.796
extended for 650 kilometers

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.476
all the way into the sea,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.300
killing unknowable amounts
of plant and animal life along the way.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.036
And lastly, here is a story
related to the crisis in Syria,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.916
a conflict which has claimed the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.260
and displaced millions.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.356
So this patch of desert
is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.076
the year the conflict started,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.740
and when we compare it to an image
captured just this year in 2017,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.140
we see the construction
of the Zaatari refugee camp.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.516
So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.476
watched the Earth rising above
the lunar landscape for the first time,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.676
there is no way
that you could have imagined

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.860
what the places I just showed you
look like from outer space.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.236
And while you may enjoy
the aesthetics of an image,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.516
once you learn exactly
what it is you're seeing,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.420
you may struggle with the fact
that you still like it.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.116
And that's the tension
I want to create with my work,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.276
because I believe
it is that contemplation,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.236
that internal dialogue

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.676
that will lead to greater
interest in our planet

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.940
and more awareness
of what we're doing to it.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.716
I believe that viewing the Earth
from the overview perspective

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.580
is more important now than ever before.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.596
Through the incredible technology
of these high-flying cameras,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.796
we can see, monitor and expose

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.220
the unprecedented impact
that we are having.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.196
And whether we are scientists

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.236
or engineers or policymakers

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.460
or investors or artists,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.676
if we can adopt
a more expansive perspective,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.996
embrace the truth of what is going on

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.260
and contemplate the long-term
health of our planet,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.156
we will create a better

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.956
and safer and smarter future

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.116
for our one and only home.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.356
Thank you.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.700
(Applause)
