00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So today, I would like to talk with you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
about bionics,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
which is the popular term

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
for the science of replacing part of a living organism

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
with a mechatronic device, or a robot.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
It is essentially

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the stuff of life meets machine.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
about how bionics is evolving

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
for people with arm amputations.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
This is our motivation.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Our hands are amazing instruments.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And when you lose one, far less both,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
it's a lot harder to do the things

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
we physically need to do.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
There's also a huge emotional impact.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
as with the physical disability.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And finally, there's a profound social impact.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
We talk with our hands.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
We greet with our hands.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And when they're missing,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
it's a barrier.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
with things like industrial accidents,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
motor vehicle collisions

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
or, very poignantly, war.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
There are also some children who are born without arms,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
called congenital limb deficiency.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Unfortunately, we don't do great

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
with upper-limb prosthetics.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
There are two general types.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
They're called body-powered prostheses,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
which were invented just after the Civil War,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
refined in World War I and World War II.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Here you see a patent

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
for an arm in 1912.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
It's not a lot different

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
than the one you see on my patient.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
They work by harnessing shoulder power.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
or bend an elbow.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And we still use them commonly,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
because they're very robust

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and relatively simple devices.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
The state of the art

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
is what we call myoelectric prostheses.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
These are motorized devices

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
that are controlled

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
by little electrical signals from your muscle.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Every time you contract a muscle,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
it emits a little electricity

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
that you can record with antennae or electrodes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
They work pretty well

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
for people who have just lost their hand,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
because your hand muscles are still there.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
You open it, these muscles contract.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
You're missing not only these muscles,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
but your hand and your elbow too.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
What do you do?

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Well our patients have to use

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
very code-y systems

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
of using just their arm muscles

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
to operate robotic limbs.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
We have robotic limbs.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
They contain just a hand that will open and close,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
a wrist rotator and an elbow.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
There's no other functions.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
including movable hands.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
But at the end of the day,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
How do we control them?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Well we need a neural interface,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
a way to connect to our nervous system

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
or our thought processes

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
so that it's intuitive, it's natural,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
like for you and I.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
going down your spinal cord,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
out the nerves and to your periphery.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And your sensation's the exact opposite.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Those nerves can put out command signals.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And if I tap the nerve ending

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
on a World War II vet,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
he'll still feel his missing hand.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
So you might say,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
let's go to the brain

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and put something in the brain to record signals,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And these are very exciting research areas,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
but it's really, really hard.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
You have to put in

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
hundreds of microscopic wires

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.260
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that put out tiny signals

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that are microvolts.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And it's just too hard

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
to use now and for my patients today.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So we developed a different approach.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
We're using a biological amplifier

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Muscles will amplify the nerve signals

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
about a thousand-fold,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
so that we can record them from on top of the skin,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
like you saw earlier.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
we still have four major nerves

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
that go down your arm.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and let these nerves grow into it.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
You think, "Bend elbow,"

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
a different section contracts.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And we can use electrodes or antennae

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
to pick that up and tell the arm to move.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
That's the idea.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So this is the first man that we tried it on.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
His name is Jesse Sullivan.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
He's just a saint of a man --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and had both of his arms burnt so badly

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
they had to be amputated at the shoulder.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Jesse came to us at the RIC

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I'm still using that old technology

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
with a bicycle cable on his right side.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
with those three joints,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and he operates little pads in his shoulder

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that he touches to make the arm go.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And Jesse's a good crane operator,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and he did okay by our standards.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And that gave us the opportunity

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
to do targeted reinnervation.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
then we took the arm nerves

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and closed him up.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And after about three months,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
And after six months, the nerves grew in well,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and you could see strong contractions.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And this is what it looks like.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
This is what happens when Jesse thinks

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
open and close his hand,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
or bend or straighten your elbow.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
You can see the movements on his chest,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and those little hash marks

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And I challenge anybody in the room

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to make their chest go like this.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
His brain is thinking about his arm.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
There is not a learning process.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
That's why it's intuitive.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So here's Jesse in our first little test with him.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and he's using those switches

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
to move little blocks from one box to the other.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
On the right side,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
which, by the way, is the same physical arm,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
just programmed a little different --

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
you can see that he's much faster

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Then we had one of those little surprises in science.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
So we're all motivated to get motor commands

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
to drive robotic arms.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And after a few months,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
you touch Jesse on his chest,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and he felt his missing hand.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
His hand sensation grew into his chest again

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
so the skin was right down to the muscle

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
you touch it here, he feels his pinky.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
He feels light touch

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
down to one gram of force.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
all in his missing hand,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
or both his hand and his chest,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
but he can attend to either.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So this is really exciting for us,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
because now we have a portal,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.260
a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
so that he might feel what he touches

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
with his prosthetic hand.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
Imagine sensors in the hand

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
So it was very exciting.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
We've also gone on

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
with what was initially our primary population

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
of people with above-the-elbow amputations.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
just from little segments of muscle

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and leave others alone

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
that give us our up-down signals

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
This was one of our first patients, Chris.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
You see him with his original device

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
on the left there after eight months of use,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
and on the right, it is two months.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
He's about four or five times as fast

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
with this simple little performance metric.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
All right.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So one of the best parts of my job

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
is working with really great patients

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
who are also our research collaborators.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And we're fortunate today

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:47.260
(Applause)

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
And I was driving home from work,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and a truck was coming the opposite direction,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
came over into my lane,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.260
ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And you've got one of these conventional arms.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Can you tell us how it worked?

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
AK: Well, it was a little difficult,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So for the simple little things like picking something up,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
I would have to bend my elbow,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and then I would have to cocontract

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
to get it to change modes.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
When I did that,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
I had to use my bicep

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
to get the hand to close,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
use my tricep to get it to open,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
cocontract again

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
to get the elbow to work again.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
TK: So it was a little slow?

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
You had to concentrate a whole lot.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
took six more months to have all the reinnervation.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
And how did that work for you?

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
AK: It works good.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
I was able to use my elbow

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and my hand simultaneously.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
I could work them just by my thoughts.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
TK: A little faster?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.260
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
TK: Okay, this was my goal.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
and at the same time.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
including over a dozen of our wounded warriors

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
in the U.S. armed services.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
It's like 96 percent.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.260
And it provides intuitive control.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Our functional testing, those little tests,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And the most important thing

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
is our patients have appreciated it.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
So that was all very exciting.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
But we want to do better.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.260
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
and we wanted to get more.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Can we get more out of it?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So we did some experiments

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
to reaching for something --

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and recorded this data.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And then we used some algorithms

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
called pattern recognition.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
See.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
(Laughter)

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
when he just tried to do three different things,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
you can see three different patterns.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
But I can't put in an electrode

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and say, "Go there."

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
came up with this algorithm control,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
which Amanda can now demonstrate.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.260
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
I have the wrist rotation

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
that goes -- and it can go all the way around.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.260
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
And I also have the hand closed and open.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
TK: Thank you, Amanda.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Now this is a research arm,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
but it's made out of commercial components from here down

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
It's about seven pounds,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
which is probably about what my arm would weigh

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
if I lost it right here.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And in fact, it feels even heavier,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
because it's not glued on the same.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
but the control.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
So we've developed a small microcomputer

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that is blinking somewhere behind her back

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and is operating this

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
all by the way she trains it

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
to use her individual muscle signals.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
how long did it take to use it?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
to get it to train.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
I had to hook it up to a computer,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
so I couldn't just train it anywhere.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
So now it's able to train

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
with just this little piece on the back.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
I can wear it around.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Takes about a minute.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
TK: So we're really excited,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And that's where our goal is --

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.260
to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
We've also had Amanda able to use

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So Amanda, you can see,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
has really good control.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
It's all the pattern recognition.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
What we do is have the patient go all the way open

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
It goes into that mode,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Amanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
AK: I was able to get four.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
I had a power grasp

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and I had a fine pinch.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
because I work with kids,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and so all the time you're clapping and singing,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
so I was able to do that again, which was really good.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
AK: Can't clap with this one.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
TK: All right. So that's exciting

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
on where we may go with the better mechatronics,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
if we make them good enough

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
to put out on the market and use in a field trial.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
I want you to watch closely.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
TK: That's Claudia,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
and that was the first time

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
that then she rubbed over different surfaces,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and she could feel different textures

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
She said that when she just ran it across the table,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
it felt like her finger was rocking.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
But look at all the electrodes around it.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
I've got a real estate problem.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
but our little motor's making all kinds of noise

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
right next to my electrodes.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
So we're really challenged on what we're doing there.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
The future is bright.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
So for example,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
one is to get rid of my real estate problem

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
and get better signals.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
We want to develop these little tiny capsules

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
about the size of a piece of risotto

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
that we can put into the muscles

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and telemeter out the EMG signals,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
so that it's not worrying about electrode contact.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
And we can have the real estate open

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
to try more sensation feedback.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
We want to build a better arm.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
This arm -- they're always made for the 50th percentile male --

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.260
which means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
So rather than a super strong or super fast arm,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
we're making an arm that is --

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
we're starting with,

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
the 25th percentile female --

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
that will have a hand that wraps around,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
opens all the way,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
So it'll be the smallest and lightest

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
and the smartest arm ever made.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
Once we can do it that small,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
it's a lot easier making them bigger.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
So those are just some of our goals.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.260
And we really appreciate you all being here today.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
with yesterday's theme.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
So Amanda came jet-lagged,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
she's using the arm,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
and everything goes wrong.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
There was a computer spook,

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
a broken wire,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
a converter that sparked.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
We took out a whole circuit in the hotel

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
and just about put on the fire alarm.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
And none of those problems could I have dealt with,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
but I have a really bright research team.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.260
And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
and worked really hard yesterday to fix it.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
That's science.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
And fortunately, it worked today.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
So thank you very much.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:44.260
(Applause)
