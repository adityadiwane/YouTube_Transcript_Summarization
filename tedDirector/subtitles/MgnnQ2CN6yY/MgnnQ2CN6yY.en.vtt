00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:19.636
This summer I was back
in Ohio for a family wedding,

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:21.985
and when I was there,

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:25.338
there was a meet and greet
with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:29.103
Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.833
as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:36.433
These two entrepreneurs had
a business of running princess parties.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.017
Your kid is turning five?

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:41.544
They'll come sing some songs,
sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:45.168
And they were not about
to miss out on the opportunity

00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:47.803
that was the phenomenon
and that was "Frozen."

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:49.700
So they get hired by a local toy store,

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.457
kids come in on a Saturday morning,

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:54.557
buy some Disney swag, get their
picture taken with the princesses,

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:56.160
call it a day.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.856
It's like Santa Claus
without the seasonal restrictions.

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.462
(Laughter)

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:05.550
And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece
Samantha was in the thick of it.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.672
She could care less that these two women
were signing posters and coloring books

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:15.956
as Snow Queen and Princess Ana
with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.

00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:17.122
(Laughter)

00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:21.818
According to my niece and the 200-plus
kids in the parking lot that day,

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.542
this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:33.597
It is a blazing hot Saturday morning
in August in Ohio.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:36.872
We get there at 10 o'clock,
the scheduled start time,

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:39.105
and we are handed number 59.

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:43.673
By 11 o'clock they had called
numbers 21 through 25;

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:45.426
this was going to be a while,

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:49.891
and there is no amount
of free face painting or temporary tattoos

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:53.396
that could prevent the meltdowns
that were occurring outside of the store.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:54.971
(Laughter)

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:59.113
So, by 12:30 we get called:

00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:02.306
"56 to 63, please."

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:05.677
And as we walk in, it is a scene
I can only describe you

00:02:05.678 --> 00:02:08.567
as saying it looked like Norway threw up.

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:09.947
(Laughter)

00:02:09.948 --> 00:02:14.333
There were cardboard
cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:19.252
glitter on every flat surface,
and icicles all over the walls.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.063
And as we stood in line

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:23.596
in an attempt to give
my niece a better vantage point

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:26.151
than the backside
of the mother of number 58,

00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.879
I put her up on my shoulders,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.978
and she was instantly riveted
by the sight of the princesses.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.519
And as we moved forward,
her excitement only grew,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.804
and as we finally got
to the front of the line,

00:02:36.804 --> 00:02:40.497
and number 58 unfurled her poster
to be signed by the princesses,

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:44.097
I could literally feel the excitement
running through her body.

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.062
And let's be honest,
at that point, I was pretty excited too.

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:48.457
(Laughter)

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:51.456
I mean, the Scandinavian decadence
was mesmerizing.

00:02:51.457 --> 00:02:52.625
(Laughter)

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:54.535
So we get to the front of the line,

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:57.545
and the haggard clerk
turns to my niece and says,

00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.365
"Hi, honey. You're next!

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:01.655
Do you want to get down,
or you're going to stay

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:03.912
on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:05.399
(Laughter)

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.261
And I was, for a lack
of a better word, frozen.

00:03:09.262 --> 00:03:10.873
(Laughter)

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:15.666
It's amazing that in an unexpected instant
we are faced with the question,

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:16.997
who am I?

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.465
Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:24.296
Millions of people have seen my video
about how to have a hard conversation,

00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:26.613
and there one was, right in front of me.

00:03:26.614 --> 00:03:27.685
At the same time,

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.595
there's nothing more important
to me than the kids in my life,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:34.543
so I found myself in a situation
that we so often find ourselves in,

00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:37.766
torn between two things,
two impossible choices.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.793
Would I be an advocate?

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:44.341
Would I take my niece off my shoulders
and turn to the clerk and explain to her

00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:47.479
that I was in fact
her aunt, not her father,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.848
and that she should be more careful

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.604
and not to jump to gender conclusions
based on haircuts and shoulder rides --

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:55.740
(Laughter) --

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.597
and while doing that,

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:02.386
miss out on what was, to this point,
the greatest moment of my niece's life.

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:05.205
Or would I be an aunt?

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:08.343
Would I brush off that comment,
take a million pictures,

00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:13.321
and not be distracted for an instant
from the pure joy of that moment,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:14.840
and by doing that,

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:18.223
walk out with the shame that comes up
for not standing up for myself,

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.606
especially in front of my niece.

00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:22.409
Who was I?

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.228
Which one was more important?
Which role was more worth it?

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.218
Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.435
And I had a split second to decide.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:35.813
We are taught right now

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:40.112
that we are living in a world
of constant and increasing polarity.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:44.684
It's so black and white,
so us and them, so right and wrong.

00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:49.691
There is no middle,
there is no gray, just polarity.

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.131
Polarity is a state in which
two ideas or opinions

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:54.712
are completely opposite from each other;

00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:56.866
a diametrical opposition.

00:04:58.127 --> 00:05:00.581
Which side are you on?

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:04.646
Are you unequivocally and without question
antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:08.104
pro-gun regulation, proponent
of open borders and pro-union?

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:13.337
Or, are you absolutely 
and uncompromisingly

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:15.522
pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,

00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:17.838
a believer that the Second
Amendment is absolute,

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.542
anti-immigrant and pro-business?

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:21.787
It's all or none, you're with us
or against us.

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.507
That is polarity.

00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:29.190
The problem with polarity 
and absolutes is that

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:34.355
it eliminates the individuality
of our human experience

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:38.381
and that makes it contradictory
to our human nature.

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:41.297
But if we are pulled
in these two directions,

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:43.077
but it's not really where we exist --

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.507
polarity is not our actual reality --

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:46.887
where do we go from there?

00:05:46.887 --> 00:05:50.367
What's at the other end of that spectrum?

00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:54.407
I don't think it's an unattainable,
harmonious utopia,

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:57.841
I think the opposite
of polarity is duality.

00:05:57.842 --> 00:06:00.446
Duality is a state of having two parts,

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:03.729
but not in diametrical opposition,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.675
in simultaneous existence.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:08.662
Don't think it's possible?

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:10.333
Here are the people I know:

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:13.497
I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
and feminists who wear hijabs,

00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:15.201
and veterans who are antiwar,

00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:17.986
and NRA members who think
I should be able to get married.

00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:21.022
Those are the people I know,
those are my friends and family,

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:23.999
that is the majority of our society,
that is you, that is me.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.657
(Applause)

00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:37.885
Duality is the ability
to hold both things.

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:42.007
But the question is:
Can we own our duality?

00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:45.730
Can we have the courage
to hold both things?

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.422
I work at a restaurant in town,

00:06:48.422 --> 00:06:51.032
I became really good friends
with the busser.

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:54.050
I was a server and we had 
a great relationship,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.990
we had a really great time together.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.608
Her Spanish was great

00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:01.450
because she was from Mexico.

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:03.312
(Laughter)

00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:05.746
That line actually went the other way.

00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:09.668
Her English was limited,
but significantly better than my Spanish.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:15.677
But we were united by our similarities,

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:18.578
not separated by our differences.

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:21.698
And we were close, even though
we came from very different worlds.

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:22.838
She was from Mexico,

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:26.169
she left her family behind
so she could come here

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.149
and afford them a better life back home.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.106
She was a devout conservative Catholic,

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:33.826
a believer in traditional family values,

00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:35.932
stereotypical roles of men and women,

00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:38.727
and I was, well, me.

00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:40.632
(Laughter)

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:44.318
But the things that bonded us
were when she asked about my girlfriend,

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:47.787
or she shared pictures that she had
from her family back home.

00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:50.415
Those were the things
that brought us together.

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:52.002
So one day, we were in the back,

00:07:52.003 --> 00:07:55.682
scarfing down food as quickly as we could,
gathered around a small table,

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.313
during a very rare lull,

00:07:57.313 --> 00:07:59.323
and a new guy
from the kitchen came over --

00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:00.985
who happened to be her cousin --

00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:03.787
and sat down with all
the bravado and machismo

00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:05.949
that his 20-year-old body could hold.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.771
(Laughter)

00:08:07.772 --> 00:08:12.744
And he said to her,
[in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"

00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:17.856
And she said,
[in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:22.911
And he said,
[in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"

00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:26.024
And she set down her fork,
and locked eyes with him,

00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:31.047
and said, [in Spanish] "Yes,
a girlfriend. That is all."

00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:35.940
And his smug smile quickly dropped
to one of maternal respect,

00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:39.143
grabbed his plate, walked off,
went back to work.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.878
She never made eye contact with me.

00:08:41.668 --> 00:08:43.383
She left, did the same thing --

00:08:43.384 --> 00:08:46.654
it was a 10-second conversation,
such a short interaction.

00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:49.191
And on paper, she had
so much more in common with him:

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:54.289
language, culture, history, family,
her community was her lifeline here,

00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:58.460
but her moral compass trumped all of that.

00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:02.123
And a little bit later, they were joking
around in the kitchen in Spanish,

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:04.024
that had nothing to do with me,

00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:06.469
and that is duality.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.983
She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance
on gayness over her heritage.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:14.133
She didn't have to choose
her family over our friendship.

00:09:14.134 --> 00:09:16.408
It wasn't Jesus or Ash.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.376
(Laughter)

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:22.493
(Applause)

00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:31.760
Her individual morality
was so strongly rooted

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:35.142
that she had the courage
to hold both things.

00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:38.324
Our moral integrity is our responsibility

00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:42.556
and we must be prepared to defend it
even when it's not convenient.

00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:45.870
That's what it means to be an ally,
and if you're going to be an ally,

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.157
you have to be an active ally:

00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:52.045
Ask questions, act when you hear
something inappropriate,

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:54.074
actually engage.

00:09:54.075 --> 00:09:58.508
I had a family friend who for years
used to call my girlfriend my lover.

00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:02.975
Really? Lover?

00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:05.000
So overly sexual,

00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:07.046
so '70s gay porn.

00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:08.253
(Laughter)

00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:13.788
But she was trying, and she asked.

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:15.572
She could have called her my friend,

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:19.707
or my "friend," or my "special friend" --

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.092
(Laughter) --

00:10:21.093 --> 00:10:24.058
or even worse, just not asked at all.

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:27.689
Believe me, we would rather have you ask.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.931
I would rather have her say lover,
than say nothing at all.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.963
People often say to me,
"Well, Ash, I don't care.

00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:39.756
I don't see race
or religion or sexuality.

00:10:39.757 --> 00:10:42.600
It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.244
But I think the opposite of homophobia
and racism and xenophobia is not love,

00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:50.858
it's apathy.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:54.962
If you don't see my gayness,
then you don't see me.

00:10:54.963 --> 00:10:57.948
If it doesn't matter to you
who I sleep with,

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.134
then you cannot imagine what it feels like

00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:03.011
when I walk down the street
late at night holding her hand,

00:11:03.011 --> 00:11:05.829
and approach a group of people
and have to make the decision

00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:08.174
if I should hang on to it
or if I should I drop it

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:10.493
when all I want to do
is squeeze it tighter.

00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:13.011
And the small victory I feel

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:15.719
when I make it by
and don't have to let go.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.838
And the incredible cowardice
and disappointment I feel when I drop it.

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:22.787
If you do not see that struggle

00:11:22.788 --> 00:11:29.263
that is unique to my human experience
because I am gay, then you don't see me.

00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:34.678
If you are going to be an ally,
I need you to see me.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:37.622
As individuals, as allies, as humans,

00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:40.622
we need to be able to hold both things:

00:11:40.622 --> 00:11:43.070
both the good and the bad,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.900
the easy and the hard.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.371
You don't learn how to hold
two things just from the fluff,

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:51.773
you learn it from the grit.

00:11:51.774 --> 00:11:55.158
And what if duality
is just the first step?

00:11:56.308 --> 00:12:01.137
What if through compassion
and empathy and human interaction

00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:03.532
we are able to learn to hold two things?

00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:05.847
And if we can hold
two things, we can hold four,

00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:07.858
and if we can hold four,
we can hold eight,

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:10.099
and if we can hold eight,
we can hold hundreds.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.562
We are complex individuals,

00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:14.362
swirls of contradiction.

00:12:14.362 --> 00:12:16.967
You are all holding
so many things right now.

00:12:17.888 --> 00:12:21.330
What can you do to hold just a few more?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.237
So, back to Toledo, Ohio.

00:12:24.237 --> 00:12:26.417
I'm at the front of the line,

00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:30.519
niece on my shoulders,
the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.080
Have you ever been mistaken
for the wrong gender?

00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:37.309
Not even that.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.759
Have you ever been called
something you are not?

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:46.039
Here's what it feels like for me:

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.113
I am instantly an internal storm
of contrasting emotions.

00:12:50.114 --> 00:12:55.656
I break out into a sweat that is
a combination of rage and humiliation,

00:12:55.657 --> 00:12:58.617
I feel like the entire store
is staring at me,

00:12:58.618 --> 00:13:01.178
and I simultaneously feel invisible.

00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:04.122
I want to explode in a tirade of fury,

00:13:04.123 --> 00:13:06.716
and I want to crawl under a rock.

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:09.819
And top all of that off
with the frustration that I'm wearing

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.418
an out-of-character
tight-fitting purple t-shirt,

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.456
so this whole store can see my boobs,

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:18.457
to make sure this exact
same thing doesn't happen.

00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:20.640
(Laughter)

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.962
But, despite my best efforts
to be seen as the gender I am,

00:13:24.962 --> 00:13:26.803
it still happens.

00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:31.496
And I hope with every ounce
of my body that no one heard --

00:13:31.497 --> 00:13:36.050
not my sister, not my girlfriend,
and certainly not my niece.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.491
I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,

00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.566
but I will do whatever I need to do
to protect the people I love from it.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:46.440
But then I take my niece off my shoulders,

00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:48.615
and she runs to Elsa and Anna --

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:51.182
the thing she's been
waiting so long for --

00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:53.270
and all that stuff goes away.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.980
All that matters is the smile on her face.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.637
And as the 30 seconds we waited
two and a half hours for comes to a close

00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:07.841
we gather up our things,
and I lock eyes with the clerk again;

00:14:07.842 --> 00:14:10.978
and she gives me
an apologetic smile and mouths,

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.275
"I am so sorry!"

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.385
(Laughter)

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:21.242
And her humanity, her willingness to admit
her mistake disarms me immediately,

00:14:21.243 --> 00:14:26.415
then I give her a: "It's okay,
it happens. But thanks."

00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:29.406
And I realize in that moment

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:31.444
that I don't have to be

00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:35.643
either an aunt
or an advocate, I can be both.

00:14:36.903 --> 00:14:42.251
I can live in duality,
and I can hold two things.

00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:45.189
And if I can hold two things
in that environment,

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.542
I can hold so many more things.

00:14:47.543 --> 00:14:51.295
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands
and skip out the front of the door,

00:14:51.296 --> 00:14:54.039
I turn to my sister and say,
"Was it worth it?"

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.814
And she said, "Are you kidding me?

00:14:55.815 --> 00:14:59.702
Did you see the look on her face?
This was the greatest day of her life!"

00:14:59.703 --> 00:15:00.800
(Laughter)

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.758
"It was worth the two
and a half hours in the heat,

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:08.146
it was worth the overpriced coloring book
that we already had a copy of."

00:15:08.147 --> 00:15:09.854
(Laughter)

00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:13.509
"It was even worth you 
getting called Dad."

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.615
(Laughter)

00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:22.919
And for the first time ever
in my life, it actually was.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.098
Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night.

00:15:25.099 --> 00:15:26.619
(Applause)
