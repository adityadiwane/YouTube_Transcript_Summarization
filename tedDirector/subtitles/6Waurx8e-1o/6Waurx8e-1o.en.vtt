00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.045
I decided when I was asked to do this

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:21.767
that what I really wanted to talk about
was my friend, Richard Feynman.

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:25.236
I was one of the fortunate few
that really did get to know him

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.670
and enjoyed his presence.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.763
And I'm going to tell you
about the Richard Feynman that I knew.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:33.086
I'm sure there are people here
who could tell you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.827
about the Richard Feynman they knew,

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.376
and it would probably be
a different Richard Feynman.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.383
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.

00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:41.383
He was a man of many, many parts.

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:46.470
He was, of course, foremost,
a very, very, very great scientist.

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.236
He was an actor. You saw him act.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.918
I also had the good fortune
to be in those lectures,

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:54.236
up in the balcony.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:56.002
They were fantastic.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.320
He was a philosopher.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.061
He was a drum player.

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:02.044
He was a teacher par excellence.

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:06.400
Richard Feynman was also a showman,

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.987
an enormous showman.

00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.446
He was brash, irreverent.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:16.236
He was full of macho,
a kind of macho one-upmanship.

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:20.318
He loved intellectual battle.

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:23.314
He had a gargantuan ego.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.893
But the man had, somehow,

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.369
a lot of room at the bottom.

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:35.123
And what I mean by that
is a lot of room, in my case --

00:01:35.147 --> 00:01:38.236
I can't speak for anybody else,
but in my case --

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.539
a lot of room for another big ego.

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:42.953
Well, not as big as his,

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.857
but fairly big.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.039
I always felt good with Dick Feynman.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.370
It was always fun to be with him.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.608
He always made me feel smart.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.220
How can somebody like that
make you feel smart?

00:01:55.244 --> 00:01:56.410
Somehow he did.

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:58.894
He made me feel smart.
He made me feel he was smart.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.869
He made me feel we were both smart,

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:04.235
and the two of us could solve
any problem whatever.

00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:08.351
And in fact, we did sometimes
do physics together.

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.420
We never published a paper together,

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:11.904
but we did have a lot of fun.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.236
He loved to win,

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.639
win these little macho games
we would sometimes play.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:21.927
And he didn't only play them with me,
but with all sorts of people.

00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.788
He would almost always win.

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:26.875
But when he didn't win, when he lost,

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.536
he would laugh and seem
to have just as much fun

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.758
as if he had won.

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.739
I remember once he told me a story

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:35.684
about a joke the students played on him.

00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:38.689
I think it was for his birthday --

00:02:38.713 --> 00:02:40.130
they took him for lunch

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:44.772
to a sandwich place in Pasadena.

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:46.431
It may still exist; I don't know.

00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:49.426
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.790
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:54.115
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.815
The students went there in advance,

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.237
and arranged that they'd all order
Feynman sandwiches.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.248
One after another, they came in
and ordered Feynman sandwiches.

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:04.500
Feynman loved this story.

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:08.558
He told me this story,
and he was really happy and laughing.

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:11.332
When he finished the story, I said to him,

00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:14.219
"Dick, I wonder what
would be the difference

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:17.236
between a Feynman sandwich
and a Susskind sandwich."

00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:19.766
And without skipping a beat at all,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.032
he said, "Well, they'd be about the same.

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:26.378
The only difference is a Susskind
sandwich would have a lot more ham."

00:03:26.402 --> 00:03:28.087
"Ham" as in bad actor.

00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.635
(Laughter)

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.069
Well, I happened to have been
very quick that day,

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.236
and I said, "Yeah,
but a lot less baloney."

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.214
(Laughter)

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:39.375
(Applause)

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.581
The truth of the matter

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:46.587
is that a Feynman sandwich
had a load of ham,

00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:49.390
but absolutely no baloney.

00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:53.178
What Feynman hated worse
than anything else

00:03:53.202 --> 00:03:55.204
was intellectual pretense --

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:56.457
phoniness,

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:58.908
false sophistication, jargon.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.478
I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:08.636
Dick and I and Sidney Coleman
would meet a couple of times

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.825
up in San Francisco --
at some very rich guy's house --

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.976
up in San Francisco for dinner.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.236
And the last time the rich guy invited us,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.396
he also invited a couple of philosophers.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.948
These guys were philosophers of mind.

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:24.336
Their specialty was the philosophy
of consciousness.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.050
And they were full of all kinds of jargon.

00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:29.470
I'm trying to remember the words --

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:33.384
"monism," "dualism,"
categories all over the place.

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:36.982
I didn't know what those meant, neither
did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.776
And what did we talk about?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.375
Well, what do you talk about
when you talk about minds?

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.563
There's one obvious thing to talk about:

00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:45.236
Can a machine become a mind?

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.567
Can you build a machine

00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:50.673
that thinks like a human being
that is conscious?

00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.431
We sat around and talked about this --
we of course never resolved it.

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:56.236
But the trouble with the philosophers

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.236
is that they were philosophizing

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.604
when they should have been
science-ophizing.

00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:03.388
It's a scientific question, after all.

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:06.319
And this was a very, very
dangerous thing to do

00:05:06.343 --> 00:05:07.772
around Dick Feynman.

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.280
(Laughter)

00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:13.733
Feynman let them have it --
both barrels, right between the eyes.

00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:16.828
It was brutal; it was funny --
ooh, it was funny.

00:05:16.852 --> 00:05:18.565
But it was really brutal.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.539
He really popped their balloon.

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:24.825
But the amazing thing was --
Feynman had to leave a little early;

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.951
he wasn't feeling too well,
so he left a little bit early.

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:30.869
And Sidney and I were left there
with the two philosophers.

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:33.883
And the amazing thing
is these guys were flying.

00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:35.723
They were so happy.

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.342
They had met the great man;

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:40.794
they had been instructed by the great man;

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:42.759
they had an enormous amount of fun

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:44.968
having their faces shoved in the mud ...

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:48.594
And it was something special.

00:05:48.618 --> 00:05:52.007
I realized there was something
just extraordinary about Feynman,

00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.845
even when he did what he did.

00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:01.348
Dick -- he was my friend;
I did call him Dick --

00:06:01.372 --> 00:06:04.058
Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.

00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.956
I think it may have been a special
rapport that he and I had.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.603
We liked each other;
we liked the same kind of things.

00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:13.110
I also like the intellectual macho games.

00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:15.618
Sometimes I would win,
mostly he would win,

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.236
but we both enjoyed them.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.650
And Dick became convinced at some point

00:06:19.674 --> 00:06:23.882
that he and I had
some kind of similarity of personality.

00:06:24.486 --> 00:06:25.940
I don't think he was right.

00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:28.183
I think the only point
of similarity between us

00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:30.405
is we both like to talk about ourselves.

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:33.270
But he was convinced of this.

00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:36.348
And the man was incredibly curious.

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:40.046
And he wanted to understand
what it was and why it was

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.897
that there was this funny connection.

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:45.318
And one day, we were walking.

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:47.168
We were in France, in Les Houches.

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:50.816
We were up in the mountains, 1976.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.098
And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:58.157
The reason he called me "Leonardo"
is because we were in Europe,

00:06:58.181 --> 00:06:59.832
and he was practicing his French.

00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:01.976
(Laughter)

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.223
And he said, "Leonardo,

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:09.236
were you closer to your mother
or your father when you were a kid?"

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.236
I said, "Well, my real hero was my father.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:15.468
He was a working man,

00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:17.145
had a fifth-grade education.

00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:20.459
He was a master mechanic,
and he taught me how to use tools.

00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:24.451
He taught me all sorts of things
about mechanical things.

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:26.506
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.483
He didn't call it the hypotenuse,

00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:30.575
he called it the shortcut distance."

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:33.892
And Feynman's eyes just opened up.

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.509
He went off like a lightbulb.

00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:38.352
And he said that he had had

00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:41.535
basically exactly the same
relationship with his father.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.550
In fact, he had been convinced at one time

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:49.385
that to be a good physicist,

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:52.742
it was very important to have had
that kind of relationship

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:53.922
with your father.

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:56.952
I apologize for the sexist
conversation here,

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.836
but this is the way it really happened.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.657
He said he had been absolutely
convinced that this was necessary,

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:06.320
a necessary part of the growing up
of a young physicist.

00:08:06.915 --> 00:08:10.048
Being Dick, he, of course,
wanted to check this.

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.348
He wanted to go out and do an experiment.

00:08:12.372 --> 00:08:13.388
(Laughter)

00:08:13.412 --> 00:08:14.564
Well, he did.

00:08:14.588 --> 00:08:16.246
He went out and did an experiment.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.185
He asked all his friends
that he thought were good physicists,

00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:21.554
"Was it your mom or your pop
that influenced you?"

00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:23.541
They were all men,

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:26.195
and to a man, every single
one of them said,

00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:27.443
"My mother."

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:30.534
(Laughter)

00:08:30.558 --> 00:08:34.558
There went that theory,
down the trash can of history.

00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:35.686
(Laughter)

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.512
But he was very excited
that he had finally met somebody

00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:42.132
who had the same experience
with his father

00:08:42.156 --> 00:08:43.591
as he had with his father.

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:47.740
And for some time, he was convinced
this was the reason we got along so well.

00:08:47.764 --> 00:08:49.401
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.652
But let me tell you a little bit
about Feynman the physicist.

00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:59.836
Feynman's style --
no, "style" is not the right word.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.705
"Style" makes you think
of the bow tie he might have worn,

00:09:02.729 --> 00:09:04.030
or the suit he was wearing.

00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:05.973
It's something much deeper than that,

00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:08.068
but I can't think of another word for it.

00:09:08.092 --> 00:09:13.534
Feynman's scientific style
was always to look for the simplest,

00:09:13.558 --> 00:09:17.473
most elementary solution
to a problem that was possible.

00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:21.022
If it wasn't possible,
you had to use something fancier.

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:26.301
No doubt, part of this
was his great joy and pleasure

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:29.757
in showing people that he could
think more simply than they could.

00:09:30.097 --> 00:09:33.256
But he also deeply believed,
he truly believed,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.520
that if you couldn't explain
something simply,

00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:37.075
you didn't understand it.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.653
In the 1950s, people
were trying to figure out

00:09:41.677 --> 00:09:43.653
how superfluid helium worked.

00:09:44.573 --> 00:09:45.749
There was a theory.

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:48.184
It was due to a Russian
mathematical physicist.

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:49.618
It was a complicated theory;

00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:51.753
I'll tell you what it was soon enough.

00:09:51.777 --> 00:09:53.625
It was a terribly complicated theory,

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:56.486
full of very difficult
integrals and formulas

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.335
and mathematics and so forth.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.097
And it sort of worked,
but it didn't work very well.

00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:03.463
The only way it worked

00:10:03.487 --> 00:10:06.706
is when the helium atoms
were very, very far apart.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.443
And unfortunately,

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:12.625
the helium atoms in liquid helium
are right on top of each other.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.990
Feynman decided, as a sort
of amateur helium physicist,

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:18.264
that he would try to figure it out.

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:20.692
He had an idea, a very clear idea.

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:22.110
He would try to figure out

00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:27.210
what the quantum wave function
of this huge number of atoms looked like.

00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:28.881
He would try to visualize it,

00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:31.836
guided by a small number
of simple principles.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.836
The small number of simple principles
were very, very simple.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.237
The first one was that when
helium atoms touch each other,

00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:39.569
they repel.

00:10:39.593 --> 00:10:42.991
The implication of that is that
the wave function has to go to zero,

00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:46.100
it has to vanish when the helium
atoms touch each other.

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:48.433
The other fact
is that in the ground state --

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:51.194
the lowest energy state
of a quantum system --

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:54.489
the wave function is always very smooth;

00:10:54.513 --> 00:10:56.608
it has the minimum number of wiggles.

00:10:56.632 --> 00:10:58.160
So he sat down --

00:10:58.184 --> 00:11:00.455
and I imagine he had nothing more

00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:02.892
than a simple piece
of paper and a pencil --

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:05.156
and he tried to write down,
and did write down,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.475
the simplest function
that he could think of,

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:09.476
which had the boundary conditions

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.964
that the wave function
vanish when things touch

00:11:11.988 --> 00:11:13.701
and is smooth in between.

00:11:14.493 --> 00:11:17.232
He wrote down a simple thing --
so simple, in fact,

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:20.383
that I suspect a really smart
high-school student

00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:21.836
who didn't even have calculus

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.793
could understand what he wrote down.

00:11:24.337 --> 00:11:27.486
The thing was, that simple thing
that he wrote down

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.051
explained everything that was known
at the time about liquid helium,

00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.348
and then some.

00:11:32.764 --> 00:11:35.741
I've always wondered
whether the professionals --

00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:37.826
the real professional helium physicists --

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.017
were just a little bit
embarrassed by this.

00:11:40.422 --> 00:11:43.091
They had their super-powerful technique,

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:44.891
and they couldn't do as well.

00:11:44.915 --> 00:11:49.042
Incidentally, I'll tell you
what that super-powerful technique was.

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:51.615
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.496
(Laughter)

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.274
He did it again in 1968.

00:11:56.781 --> 00:12:01.767
In 1968, in my own university --
I wasn't there at the time --

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.363
they were exploring
the structure of the proton.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.373
The proton is obviously made
of a whole bunch of little particles;

00:12:08.397 --> 00:12:10.337
this was more or less known.

00:12:10.782 --> 00:12:14.118
And the way to analyze it was,
of course, Feynman diagrams.

00:12:14.142 --> 00:12:16.683
That's what Feynman diagrams
were constructed for --

00:12:16.707 --> 00:12:17.976
to understand particles.

00:12:18.494 --> 00:12:21.106
The experiments that were going on
were very simple:

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.465
you simply take the proton,

00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:25.099
and you hit it really sharply
with an electron.

00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:27.814
This was the thing
the Feynman diagrams were for.

00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:32.314
The only problem was that
Feynman diagrams are complicated.

00:12:32.338 --> 00:12:33.878
They're difficult integrals.

00:12:33.902 --> 00:12:37.073
If you could do all of them,
you would have a very precise theory,

00:12:37.097 --> 00:12:39.674
but you couldn't --
they were just too complicated.

00:12:40.573 --> 00:12:42.034
People were trying to do them.

00:12:42.058 --> 00:12:44.978
You could do a one-loop diagram.
Don't worry about one loop.

00:12:45.002 --> 00:12:48.007
One loop, two loops --
maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,

00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:50.085
but beyond that, you couldn't do anything.

00:12:50.109 --> 00:12:51.753
Feynman said, "Forget all of that.

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:53.248
Just think of the proton

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:57.605
as an assemblage, a swarm,
of little particles."

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:59.280
He called them "partons."

00:12:59.304 --> 00:13:05.007
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm
of partons moving real fast."

00:13:05.031 --> 00:13:07.118
Because they're moving real fast,

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:12.358
relativity says the internal
motions go very slow.

00:13:13.081 --> 00:13:14.693
The electron hits it suddenly --

00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:18.774
it's like taking a very sudden
snapshot of the proton.

00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:20.568
What do you see?

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:24.626
You see a frozen bunch of partons.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.832
They don't move,

00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:28.912
and because they don't move
during the course of the experiment,

00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:31.245
you don't have to worry
about how they're moving.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.875
You don't have to worry
about the forces between them.

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:39.088
You just get to think of it
as a population of frozen partons."

00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:43.038
This was the key to analyzing
these experiments.

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:45.836
Extremely effective.

00:13:46.247 --> 00:13:48.749
Somebody said the word
"revolution" is a bad word.

00:13:48.773 --> 00:13:50.914
I suppose it is,
so I won't say "revolution,"

00:13:50.938 --> 00:13:56.440
but it certainly evolved very, very deeply
our understanding of the proton,

00:13:56.464 --> 00:13:58.260
and of particles beyond that.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.248
Well, I had some more
that I was going to tell you

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:02.929
about my connection with Feynman,

00:14:02.953 --> 00:14:04.127
what he was like,

00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:06.455
but I see I have exactly half a minute.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:10.406
So I think I'll just finish up by saying:

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.226
I actually don't think
Feynman would have liked this event.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.539
I think he would have said,
"I don't need this."

00:14:18.142 --> 00:14:19.292
But ...

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:20.324
(Laughter)

00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:21.706
How should we honor Feynman?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.412
How should we really honor Feynman?

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:26.580
I think the answer
is we should honor Feynman

00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:30.566
by getting as much baloney
out of our own sandwiches

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.836
as we can.

00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:33.352
Thank you.

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:36.577
(Applause)
