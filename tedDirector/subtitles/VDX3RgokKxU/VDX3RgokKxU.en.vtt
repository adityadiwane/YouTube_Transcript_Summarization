00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I just want to say, over the last few years I've been --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
had the opportunity to do this closing conference.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I've had some incredible warm-up acts.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
About eight years ago,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Billy Graham opened for me.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I thought that there was --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I thought that there was absolutely no way

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in hell to top that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I just wanted to say --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and I mean this without irony --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I think I can speak for everybody in the audience

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Applause)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
OK, this is the title of my talk today.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I just want to give you a quick overview.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I mean everything with great affection.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
now is the time to check your Blackberry.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Just to review, this is my TEDTalk.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We're going to do some jokes,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
some gags,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
some little skits --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and then we're going to talk about the L1 point.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Laughter)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, one of the questions I ask myself

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is, was this the most distressing TED ever?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's try and sum things up, shall we?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Images of limb regeneration

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and faces filled with smallpox:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
21 percent of the conference.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Laughter)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And David Pogue singing show tunes.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
(Applause)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Because this is the most distressing TED ever,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
then we're going to have a scream bag next year.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So you're going to be able to go like this.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Laughter)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Bring it over here

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and open it up. Aaaah!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Laughter)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Meanwhile, back at TED University,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So Robert Wright -- I don't know,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it might have been him.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Laughter)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
He was talking about morality.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Economy class morality is,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Business class morality is,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
don't bomb Japan -- they built my car.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico -- they clean my house.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yes, it is politically incorrect.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
All right,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ...

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All right, now these are the wha --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'd say, [mumble, mumble --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
mumble] -- ahh!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So I wanted to show you guys --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that lets you work with images just as easily

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
as you -- as a completely natural user interface.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And you can --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
you can use really natural hand gestures

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to like, go like this.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Applause)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now we had a Harvard professor here --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and she was actually a professor from Harvard.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
what the fuck she was talking about.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Laughter)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
one of the things that is very important to me

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And that's why I went out

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and I picked up a best-selling business book.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and it's called

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"The Porpoise Driven Life."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And Rick is as

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
a pagan god,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
which I thought was kind of appropriate,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in a certain way.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And now we're going to have kind of

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
a little more visualization about Rick Warren.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
OK.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Laughter)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
All right.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Now, red is Rick Warren,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and green is Daniel Dennett, OK?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
(Laughter)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Laughter)

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Let me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
(Laughter)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Applause)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now, one of the things that's very important is,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I'm sorry --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
(Laughter)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
about One Laptop Per Child.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that are important for this revolutionary device.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and then I'll show it to you in person.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
First of all, it needs to be small.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Lightweight. Portable.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Uses very, very little power.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Very, very high resolution.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And broadly applicable across many platforms.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, we've actually done some research --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
They did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of what the students in the field are actually asking for.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And here it is,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the $100 computer.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And he and his team of junior-high school students

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
were doing real science.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So we're trying to check and trying to douse here,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and see who uses marijuana.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
See who uses marijuana.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Only if we open enough locker doors.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We start. This is day one.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
(Laughter)

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Day two.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Day three.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Day four.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Laughter)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Day five

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and day six.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
(Laughter)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I know that even though she'll be scarred for life,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
she's going to make a full recovery.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Laughter)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now the good news about Architects for Humanity

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
is they're really kind of the most amazing group.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They've been sponsoring a design competition

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to come up with innovative medical housing solutions,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
clinic solutions, in Africa,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and they've had a design competition.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the head of the Google Foundation,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and so he decided that he would support --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
he would support Cameron's work.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And the way he decided to support that work

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
of Google snacks.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So I want to show you some prototypes.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but I think we have some more exciting things.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Laughter)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
(Applause)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And the really wonderful thing about this is,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
when you're done, well --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
you can eat it.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
But the thing that I'm really, really excited about

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is this incredible granola house.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to collect water and recycle it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and Gummy Bears to let in the light.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
(Laughter)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to diffuse the light more slightly.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Laughter)

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
(Applause)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So, Einstein --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Einstein, tell me --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
what's your favorite song?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
No, I said what's your favorite song?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
No, I said what's your favorite song?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
"Free Bird."

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
(Applause)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
OK, so, Einstein,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
what's your favorite singing group?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Audience: Supremes!

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Tom Reilly: Exactly.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Applause)

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
(Laughter)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
"Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
this is what you might hear.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Satan. Satan. Satan.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
(Laughter)

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
so I wanted to help you a little bit.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000
(Laughter)

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
TR: So,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we've talked a lot about global warming,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
good weather in the wintertime, and New York City.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So I've tried to figure out a good design process

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
to come up with a new term to replace "global warming."

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
into "Het globale Verwarmen."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
From Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
(Laughter)

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Then Portuguese to Pig Latin.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000
(Laughter)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Aquecer-se ucked-fay.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And then finally back into the English,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which is, we're totally fucked.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
(Laughter)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
(Applause)

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Now I don't know about you,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
For example, in cheese sandwiches.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I tried to make it a little bit clearer.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
(Laughter)

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Is it the Virgin Mary?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Or is it Mena Trott?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we tried to come up with a program --

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So first of all we decided --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
(Laughter)

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
that we needed about one-third bookstore,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
one-third Google cafe,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
about five percent for restrooms.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
the lobby and the Steinbeck forum.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Now let me show you how that

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
literally translated into the design program.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So first,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So we're going to build this new building on stilts.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So we build this building on stilts,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
then up here --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
(Laughter)

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
(Laughter)

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
(Laughter)

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and the Portola Plaza on the top.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Applause)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
of separated at birth.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
(Laughter)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
OK. Now, we've heard, of course,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that we're all soldiers here.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So what I'd really, really like you to do now is,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I want you to get out a pen,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and I want you to write a terrorist note.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
(Laughter)

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
If we put up the ELMO for a moment --

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
(Laughter)

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And once you've folded it into a paper airplane,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I want you to take some anthrax --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
(Laughter)

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and I want you to put that in the paper airplane.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
(Laughter)

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And I wanted to see --

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
OK.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Now this film isn't really hard enough,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
so I wanted to make it a little bit harder.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
(Laughter)

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
3.1415,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
2657,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
753,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
8567,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
24972 --

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
-- 85871, 25871,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
3928, 5657,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
2592, 5624.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
(Applause)

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Can we cue the music please?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:24.000
(Applause)

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Back in 1968,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
was covered in 151 inches of snow pack.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Parenthetically, over there on the slopes,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I did want to show you that black men ski.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
(Laughter)

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
But over the years,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
10 years later, the snow packs eroded,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
The water level of the lake has started drying up.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
A few years later, there's no snow left at all.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And all the trees have turned brown.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
in 20 years, it's going to look like this.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:36.000
(Laughter)

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
(Laughter)

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
(Applause)

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:02.000
(Applause)
