00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
rarely makes the front pages.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
It, however, is enormous

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in both scale and importance.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Look, you all are very well traveled;

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
this is TEDGlobal after all.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
But I do hope to take you to some places

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
you've never been to before.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
So, let's start off in China.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
This photo was taken two weeks ago.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
has just graduated from high school.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
(Laughter)

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
But this is Tiananmen Square.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Let me take you to the real China.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
This is in the Dabian Mountains

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
She lives with her parents,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
her two brothers and her great-aunt.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
They have a hut that has no electricity,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
no running water,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
no wristwatch, no bicycle.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And they share this great splendor

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
with a very large pig.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
"We're going to pull you out of school

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Why would we waste this money on you?"

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Turns out that Dai Manju was

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
the best pupil in her grade.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and tried to catch every little bit of information

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
that seeped out of the doors.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We wrote about her in The New York Times.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
We got a flood of donations --

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
mostly 13-dollar checks

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
because New York Times readers are very generous

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in tiny amounts

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
(Laughter)

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
but then, we got a money transfer

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
for $10,000 --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
really nice guy.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
He was delighted.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
I can give scholarships to all the girls,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
you know, if they work hard and stay in school.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So Dai Manju basically

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
finished out middle school.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
She went to high school.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
She went to vocational school for accounting.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
She found a job, she scouted for jobs

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
for her classmates and her friends.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
She sent money back to her family.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
They built a new house,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
this time with running water,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
electricity, a bicycle,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
no pig.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
What we saw was a natural experiment.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
It is rare to get an exogenous investment

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
in girls' education.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and into a virtuous cycle.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
She not only changed her own dynamic,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The village became a real standout.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
but they were able to get a road built

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
to link them up to the rest of China.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And that brings me to my first major

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
of two tenets of "Half the Sky."

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And that is that

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
the central moral challenge

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
of this century

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
is gender inequity.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
In the 19th century, it was slavery.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
The cause of our time

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
is the brutality that so many people

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
face around the world because of their gender.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So some of you may be thinking,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
"Gosh, that's hyperbole.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
She's exaggerating."

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Well, let me ask you this question.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Hands up, please.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Okay, most of you.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
There are, true enough,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in Europe and the West,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
when women and men

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
have equal access to food and health care,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
there are more women, we live longer.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
In fact, demographers have shown

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that there are anywhere between 60 million

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and 100 million

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
missing females in the current population.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And, you know, it happens for several reasons.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
For instance, in the last half-century,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
more girls were discriminated to death

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
than all the people killed on all the battlefields

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
in the 20th century.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Girls get aborted before they're even born

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
when there are scarce resources.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
This girl here, for instance,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
The entire center was filled with girls like her.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
were totally fine.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
In India, in the first year of life,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
from zero to one,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
because they depend upon the breast,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and the breast shows no son preference.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
From one to five,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
than boys, in all of India.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
The second tenet of "Half the Sky"

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and just on a purely practical level,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
we think that

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is to educate girls

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and to bring women into the formal labor force.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Poverty, for instance.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
There are three reasons why this is the case.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
For one, overpopulation is one of

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
the persistent causes of poverty.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
And you know, when you educate a boy,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
his family tends to have fewer kids,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
but only slightly.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
When you educate a girl,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
she tends to have significantly fewer kids.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The second reason is

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
it has to do with spending.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
which is that,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
not only do poor people

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
take in very little income,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
but also, the income that they take in,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
they don't spend it very wisely,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
So research has shown,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
if you look at people who live under two dollars a day --

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
one metric of poverty --

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
two percent of that take-home pay

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
goes to this basket here, in education.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks --

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and prostitution and festivals.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
If you just take four percentage points

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
and put it into this basket,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
you would have a transformative effect.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
The last reason has to do

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
with women being part of the solution, not the problem.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
You need to use scarce resources.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Bill Gates put it very well

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
On this side was men,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
and then the barrier, and this side was women.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
And someone from this side of the room got up and said,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to be one of the top 10 countries

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
when it comes to technology.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Do you think we'll make it?"

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
So here is Bill of Arabia.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
(Laughter)

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
So what would some of the specific challenges

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
look like?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
I would say, on the top of the agenda

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
is sex trafficking.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And I'll just say two things about this.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
in the 1780s:

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
there were about 80,000 slaves

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
transported from Africa to the New World.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Now, modern slavery:

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
according to State Department rough statistics,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number --

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
that are trafficked across international borders.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
And that does not even include those

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
that are trafficked within country borders,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
which is a substantial portion.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
And if you look at

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
another factor, another contrast,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
a slave back then is worth

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
about $40,000

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
in today's money.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
for a few hundred dollars,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
which means she's actually more disposable.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
But you know, there is progress being made

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
in places like Cambodia and Thailand.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
We don't have to expect a world

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
where girls are bought and sold or killed.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
The second item on the agenda

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
is maternal mortality.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
You know, childbirth in this part of the world

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
is a wonderful event.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
In Niger, one in seven women

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
can expect to die during childbirth.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
Around the world,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.260
one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
You know, it's not as though

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
we don't have the technological solution,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
but these women have three strikes against them:

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
they are poor, they are rural

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and they are female.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
You know, for every woman who does die,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
there are 20 who survive

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
but end up with an injury.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And the most devastating injury

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
is obstetric fistula.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
It's a tearing during obstructed labor

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
that leaves a woman incontinent.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Let me tell you about Mahabuba.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
She lives in Ethiopia.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
She was married against her will at age 13.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
but you know, her body was very immature,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and she ended up having obstructed labor.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
So that meant she was incontinent;

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
she couldn't control her wastes.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
In a word, she stank.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
They ripped off the door

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
so that the hyenas would get her at night.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
That night, there was a stick in the hut.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And the next morning,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
she would be saved.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
Because she had some damage to her nerves,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
she crawled all the way -- 30 miles --

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
to that doorstep, half dead.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
The foreign missionary opened the door,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
knew exactly what had happened,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and she was repaired

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
with a 350-dollar operation.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
The doctors and nurses there noticed

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
that she was not only a survivor,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So now, Mahabuba,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
she is saving the lives

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
of hundreds, thousands, of women.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
She's moved out of a vicious cycle

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
and into a virtuous cycle.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
I've talked about some of the challenges,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
let me talk about some of the solutions,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and there are predictable solutions.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
I've hinted at them: education

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and also economic opportunity.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So of course, when you educate a girl,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
she tends to get married later on in life,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and those kids that she does have,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
With economic opportunity,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
it can be transformative.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Let me tell you about Saima.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And at the time, she was miserable.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
She was beaten every single day

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
by her husband, who was unemployed.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and took his frustrations out on her.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Well, when she had her second daughter,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
her mother in-law told her son,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
"I think you'd better get a second wife.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Saima's not going to produce you a son."

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
This is when she had her second daughter.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
At the time, there was

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
a microlending group in the village

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
that gave her a 65-dollar loan.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Saima took that money,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
and she started an embroidery business.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
and they kept asking for more.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And when she couldn't produce enough,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
she hired other women in the village.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
working for her embroidery business.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And then,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
from the village to the marketplace,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
she needed someone to help her do the transport,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
so she hired her husband.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
So now they're in it together.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
He does the transportation and distribution,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
and she does the production and sourcing.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And now they have a third daughter,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
because Saima knows what's really important.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Which brings me to the final element, which is education.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
once said that, "It may well be

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
that the highest return on investment

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
in the developing world

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
is in girls' education."

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Beatrice was living in Uganda

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
near the Congo border,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Actually, she had never been to school,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
not to a lick, one day.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Her parents, again, said,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
"Why should we spend the money on her?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Well, it just so happens, at that time,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
there was a group in Connecticut

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
They made a donation to an organization

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
based in Arkansas

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
called Heifer International.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
and that goat had twins.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
The twins started producing milk.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
They sold the milk for cash.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
The cash started accumulating,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and pretty soon the parents said,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
So at nine years of age,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
Beatrice started in first grade --

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
after all, she'd never been to a lick of school --

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
with a six year-old.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
She rocketed to the top of her class.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
She stayed at the top of her class

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
through elementary school, middle school,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and then in high school,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
she scored brilliantly on the national examinations

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
so that she became the first person in her village,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
ever, to come to the United States

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
on scholarship.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Two years ago,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
she graduated from Connecticut College.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
On the day of her graduation,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
because of a goat."

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
(Laughter)

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And that goat was $120.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
So you see how transformative

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
little bits of help can be.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
But I want to give you a reality check.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
There's Bill Easterly's book.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
There's a book called "Dead Aid."

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
You know, the criticism is fair;

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
it isn't easy.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
You know, people say how

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
When I was in Zimbabwe,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
we were touring a place with the village chief --

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
he wanted to raise money for a secondary school --

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
and there was some construction a few yards away,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
and I said, "What's that?"

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
He sort of mumbled.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
you actually improve.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
We also think that individuals

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
can make a difference, and they should,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
because individuals, together,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
we can all help create a movement.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
And a movement of men and women

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
is what's needed to bring about social change,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
change that will address

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
this great moral challenge.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.260
So then, I ask,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
what's in it for you?

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
I will just leave you with two things.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
One is that research shows

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
that once you have

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
all of your material needs taken care of --

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
which most of us, all of us, here in this room do --

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
research shows that

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
there are very few things in life

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
that can actually elevate your level of happiness.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
One of those things

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
is contributing to a cause larger than yourself.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
And the second thing,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
And that is the story

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
of an aid worker in Darfur.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
Here was a woman

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
who had worked in Darfur,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
seeing things that no human being should see.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Throughout her time there,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
she was strong, she was steadfast.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
She never broke down.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
And then she came back to the United States

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
and was on break, Christmas break.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
She was in her grandmother's backyard,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and she saw something that made her break down in tears.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
What that was

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
was a bird feeder.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
And she realized that she had the great fortune

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
to be born in a country

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
where we take security for granted,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
where we not only can feed, clothe

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
and house ourselves,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
but also provide for wild birds

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.260
so they don't go hungry in the winter.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
And she realized that with that great fortune

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
comes great responsibility.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.260
And so, like her,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
you, me,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
we have all won the lottery of life.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
And so the question becomes:

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.260
how do we discharge that responsibility?

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
So, here's the cause.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Join the movement.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
Feel happier and help save the world.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
(Applause)
