00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:18.456
Our ability to create
and sustain economic growth

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.216
is the defining challenge of our time.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.776
Of course there are other challenges --

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.936
health care, disease burdens
and pandemics,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.760
environmental challenges

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.080
and, of course, radicalized terrorism.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.016
However,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.616
to the extent that we can actually
solve the economic growth challenge,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.976
it will take us a long way

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600
to solving the challenges
that I've just elucidated.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.056
More importantly,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.576
unless and until we solve economic growth

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.616
and create sustainable,
long-term economic growth,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.056
we'll be unable to address

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.416
the seemingly intractable challenges
that continue to pervade the globe today,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.840
whether it's health care,
education or economic development.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.880
The fundamental question is this:

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.136
How are we going to create economic growth

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.736
in advanced and developed economies
like the United States and across Europe

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.816
at a time when they continue to struggle

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.640
to create economic growth
after the financial crisis?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.256
They continue to underperform

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.400
and to see an erosion in the three
key drivers of economic growth:

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.360
capital, labor and productivity.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.576
In particular,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.536
these developed economies
continue to see debts and deficits,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.416
the decline and erosion
of both the quality and quantity of labor

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.720
and they also see productivity stalling.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.296
In a similar vein,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.736
how are we going to create
economic growth in the emerging markets,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.016
where 90 percent
of the world's population lives

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.576
and where, on average,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.120
70 percent of the population
is under the age of 25?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.096
In these countries,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.296
it is essential that they grow
at a minimum of seven percent a year

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.416
in order to put a dent in poverty

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.640
and to double per capita incomes
in one generation.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.576
And yet today,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.696
the largest emerging economies --

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.416
countries with at least
50 million people --

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
continue to struggle to reach
that seven percent magic mark.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.976
Worse than that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.616
countries like India, Russia,
South Africa, Brazil and even China

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.136
are falling below
that seven percent number

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.000
and, in many cases, actually regressing.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.720
Economic growth matters.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.896
With economic growth,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.096
countries and societies
enter into a virtuous cycle

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.720
of upward mobility, opportunity
and improved living standards.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.056
Without growth,
countries contract and atrophy,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.296
not just in the annals
of economic statistics

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840
but also in the meaning of life
and how lives are lived.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.320
Economic growth matters
powerfully for the individual.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.736
If growth wanes,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.776
the risk to human progress

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.216
and the risk of political
and social instability rises,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.800
and societies become dimmer,
coarser and smaller.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.296
The context matters.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.936
And countries in emerging markets

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.800
do not need to grow at the same
rates as developed countries.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.680
Now, I know some of you in this room
find this to be a risky proposition.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.536
There are some people here

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.096
who will turn around
and be quite disillusioned

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.896
by what's happened around the world

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.520
and basically ascribe that
to economic growth.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.736
You worry about the
overpopulation of the planet.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.656
And looking at the UN's
recent statistics and projections

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.376
that the world will have
11 billion people on the planet

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.976
before it plateaus in 2100,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.816
you're concerned about what that does
to natural resources --

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.960
arable land, potable water,
energy and minerals.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.120
You are also concerned about
the degradation of the environment.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.896
And you worry about how man,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.536
embodied in the corporate globalist,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.600
has become greedy and corrupt.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.936
But I'm here to tell you today
that economic growth

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.336
has been the backbone
of changes in living standards

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.320
of millions of people around the world.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.776
And more importantly,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.280
it's not just economic growth
that has been driven by capitalism.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.736
The definition of capitalism,
very simply put,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.816
is that the factors of production,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.216
such as trade and industry,
capital and labor,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.160
are left in the hands
of the private sector and not the state.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.416
It's really essential here
that we understand

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.456
that fundamentally the critique
is not for economic growth per se

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.536
but what has happened to capitalism.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.576
And to the extent that we need to create
economic growth over the long term,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.280
we're going to have to pursue it
with a better form of economic stance.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.216
Economic growth needs capitalism,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.920
but it needs it to work properly.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.136
And as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.120
the core of the capitalist system
has been defined by private actors.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.776
And even this, however,
is a very simplistic dichotomy.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.720
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.776
When in practical experience,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.256
capitalism is much more of a spectrum.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.536
And we have countries such as China,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.976
which have practiced
more state capitalism,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.096
and we have countries
like the Unites States

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.720
which are more market capitalist.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.296
Our efforts to critique
the capitalist system, however,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.536
have tended to focus
on countries like China

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960
that are in fact
not blatantly market capitalism.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.256
However, there is
a real reason and real concern

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.936
for us to now focus our attentions
on purer forms of capitalism,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.680
particularly those embodied
by the United States.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.056
This is really important

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.536
because this type of capitalism

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.816
has increasingly
been afforded the critique

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.256
that it is now fostering corruption

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.656
and, worse still,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.320
it's increasing income inequality --

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.840
the idea that the few are benefiting
at the expense of the many.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.976
The two really critical questions
that we need to address

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.696
is how can we fix capitalism

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.496
so that it can help create economic growth

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.880
but at the same time
can help to address social ills.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.096
In order to think about that framing,
we have to ask ourselves,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.840
how does capitalism work today?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.360
Very simplistically,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.736
capitalism is set on the basis
of an individual utility maximizer --

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.056
a selfish individual
who goes after what he or she wants.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.216
And only after they've
maximized their utility

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.736
do they then decide it's important

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.840
to provide support
to other social contracts.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.776
Of course, in this system
governments do tax,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.536
and they use part of their revenues
to fund social programs,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.416
recognizing that government's role
is not just regulation

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.720
but also to be arbiter of social goods.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.616
But nevertheless,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.976
this framework --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.976
this two-stage framework --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.976
is the basis from which we must now start

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.600
to think about how we can
improve the capitalist model.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.920
I would argue that there are
two sides to this challenge.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.736
First of all,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.696
we can draw on the right-wing policies

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.576
to see what could be beneficial for us

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.720
to think about how
we can improve capitalism.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.696
In particular,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.456
right-leaning policies

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.936
have tended to focus on things
like conditional transfers,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.976
where we pay and reward people
for doing the things

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.456
that we actually think
can help enhance economic growth.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.696
For example,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.336
sending children to school,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.576
parents could earn money for that,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.976
or getting their children
inoculated or immunized,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.880
parents could get paid for doing that.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.456
Now, quite apart from the debate

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.776
on whether or not
we should be paying people

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.496
to do what we think they should do anyway,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.696
the fact of the matter
is that pay for performance

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.136
has actually yielded some positive results

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.856
in places like Mexico,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.136
in Brazil

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.760
and also in pilot programs in New York.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.016
But there are also benefits

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.400
and significant changes underway
on left-leaning policies.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.136
Arguments that government should
expand its role and responsibility

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.376
so that it's not so narrowly defined

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.895
and that government should be
much more of an arbiter

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:46.296
of the factors of production

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.720
have become commonplace
with the success of China.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.696
But also we've started to have debates

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.976
about how the role of the private sector

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.576
should move away
from just being a profit motive

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.096
and really be more engaged
in the delivery of social programs.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.336
Things like the corporate
social responsibility programs,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.336
albeit small in scale,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.240
are moving in that right direction.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.176
Of course, left-leaning policies
have also tended to blur the lines

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.880
between government,
NGOs and private sector.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.776
Two very good examples of this
are the 19th-century United States,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.416
when the infrastructure rollout

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.536
was really about
public-private partnerships.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.976
More recently, of course,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.616
the advent of the Internet
has also proven to the world

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.480
that public and private can work together
for the betterment of society.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.296
My fundamental message to you is this:

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.736
We cannot continue to try and solve
the world economic growth challenges

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.920
by being dogmatic
and being unnecessarily ideological.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.616
In order to create sustainable,
long-term economic growth

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.936
and solve the challenges and social ills
that continue to plague the world today,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.256
we're going to have to be
more broad-minded

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.800
about what might work.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.856
Ultimately,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.016
we have to recognize
that ideology is the enemy of growth.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.256
Thank you.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.520
(Applause)

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.056
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask
a couple of questions, Dambisa,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.216
because one could react
to your last sentence

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.056
by saying growth is also an ideology,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.416
it's possibly the dominant
ideology of our times.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.536
What do you say
to those who react that way?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.016
DM: Well, I think that that's
completely legitimate,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.616
and I think that we're already
having that discussion.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.856
There's a lot of work
going on around happiness

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.376
and other metrics being used
for measuring people's success

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.216
and improvements in living standards.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.296
And so I think that we should be open

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.296
to what could deliver improvements
in people's living standards

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.576
and continue to reduce
poverty around the world.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.416
BG: So you're basically pleading
for rehabilitating growth,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.016
but the only way for that happen

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.376
without compromising
the capacity of the earth,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.936
to take us on a long journey,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.616
is for economic growth

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.336
somehow to decouple
from the underlying use of resources.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.656
Do you see that happening?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.216
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic
about human ability and ingenuity.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.416
I think if we start to constrain ourselves

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.496
using the finite, scarce
and depleting resources

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.776
that we know today,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.136
we could get quite negative

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.376
and quite concerned
about the way the world is.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.696
However, we've seen the Club of Rome,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.136
we've seen previous claims

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.496
that the world would be
running out of resources,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.096
and it's not to argue
that those things are not valid.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.776
But I think, with ingenuity
we could see desalination,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.736
I think we could reinvest in energy,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.896
so that we can actually
get better outcomes.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.136
And so in that sense,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.536
I'm much more optimistic
about what humans can do.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.976
BG: The thing that strikes me

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.376
about your proposals
for rehabilitating growth

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.016
and taking a different direction

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.096
is that you're kind of suggesting
to fix capitalism with more capitalism --

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.736
with putting a price tag
on good behavior as incentive

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.936
or developing a bigger role
for business in social issues.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.456
Is that what you're suggesting?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.616
DM: I'm suggesting
we have to be open-minded.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.856
I think it is absolutely the case

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.336
that traditional models of economic growth

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.776
are not working the way
we would like them to.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.696
And I think it's no accident

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.016
that today the largest
economy in the world, the United States,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.336
has democracy,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.456
liberal democracy,
as it's core political stance

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.656
and it has free market capitalism --

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.256
to the extent that it is free --

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.456
free market capitalism
as its economic stance.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.616
The second largest economy is China.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.776
It has deprioritized democracy

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.976
and it has state capitalism,
which is a completely different model.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.736
These two countries,
completely different political models

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.736
and completely different economic models,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.176
and yet they have the same
income inequality number

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.696
measured as a Gini coefficient.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.856
I think those are the debates
we should have,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.016
because it's not clear at all

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.856
what model we should be adopting,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.216
and I think there needs to be
much more discourse

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.656
and much more humility
about what we know and what we don't know.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.056
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.576
If you could send a tweet

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.896
to all the heads of state
and heads of delegations there,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.296
what would you say?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.976
DM: Again, I would be very much
about being open-minded.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.216
As you're aware,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.336
the issues around
the environmental concerns

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.336
have been on the agenda many times now --

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.616
in Copenhagen,
'72 in Stockholm --

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.936
and we keep revisiting these issues

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.536
partly because there is not
a fundamental agreement,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.816
in fact there's a schism

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.576
between what the developed
countries believe and want

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.936
and what emerging market countries want.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.176
Emerging market countries need
to continue to create economic growth

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.616
so that we don't have political
uncertainty in the those countries.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.776
Developed countries recognize

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.056
that they have a real,
important responsibility

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.896
not only just to manage
their CO2 emissions

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.096
and some of the degradation
that they're contributing to the world,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.896
but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.176
And so they have to come
to the table as well.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.656
But in essence, it cannot be a situation

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.816
where we start ascribing policies
to the emerging markets

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.696
without developed countries themselves

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.096
also taking quite a swipe
at what they're doing

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.896
both in demand and supply
in developed markets.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.016
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.483
