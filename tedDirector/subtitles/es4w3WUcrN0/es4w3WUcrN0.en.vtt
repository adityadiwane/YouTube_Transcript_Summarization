00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:15.828
This story starts with these two --

00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:17.110
my kids.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.816
We were hiking in the Oakland woods

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.974
when my daughter noticed
a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.129
She looked at me and said,

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:27.660
"Daddy?

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.334
That doesn't go there."

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.780
When she said that,
it reminded me of summer camp.

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:33.302
On the morning of visiting day,

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:36.989
right before they'd let our anxious
parents come barreling through the gates,

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:38.382
our camp director would say,

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.715
"Quick! Everyone pick up
five pieces of litter."

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.779
You get a couple hundred kids
each picking up five pieces,

00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:46.376
and pretty soon, you've got
a much cleaner camp.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.559
So I thought,

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:52.120
why not apply that crowdsourced
cleanup model to the entire planet?

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:55.095
And that was the inspiration
for Litterati.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.468
The vision is to create
a litter-free world.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.000
Let me show you how it started.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:03.410
I took a picture of a cigarette
using Instagram.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:05.909
Then I took another photo ...

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.490
and another photo ...

00:01:07.514 --> 00:01:08.681
and another photo.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:09.991
And I noticed two things:

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:13.487
one, litter became artistic
and approachable;

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:15.215
and two,

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.754
at the end of a few days,
I had 50 photos on my phone

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.365
and I had picked up each piece,

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.774
and I realized that I was keeping a record

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.949
of the positive impact
I was having on the planet.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:27.161
That's 50 less things that you might see,

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:28.428
or you might step on,

00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:29.910
or some bird might eat.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.241
So I started telling people
what I was doing,

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.621
and they started participating.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:38.344
One day,

00:01:38.368 --> 00:01:40.896
this photo showed up from China.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.130
And that's when I realized

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:46.420
that Litterati was more
than just pretty pictures;

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:49.813
we were becoming a community
that was collecting data.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.579
Each photo tells a story.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.292
It tells us who picked up what,

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:57.327
a geotag tells us where

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.381
and a time stamp tells us when.

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:02.255
So I built a Google map,

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.332
and started plotting the points
where pieces were being picked up.

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:10.274
And through that process,
the community grew

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:11.937
and the data grew.

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:16.087
My two kids go to school
right in that bullseye.

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:18.156
Litter:

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.884
it's blending into
the background of our lives.

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.007
But what if we brought it
to the forefront?

00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.943
What if we understood exactly
what was on our streets,

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:27.356
our sidewalks

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.918
and our school yards?

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:32.189
How might we use that data
to make a difference?

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.207
Well, let me show you.

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.616
The first is with cities.

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:40.877
San Francisco wanted to understand
what percentage of litter was cigarettes.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:42.063
Why?

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:43.296
To create a tax.

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:46.028
So they put a couple of people
in the streets

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:47.413
with pencils and clipboards,

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:49.500
who walked around collecting information

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:52.635
which led to a 20-cent tax
on all cigarette sales.

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.760
And then they got sued

00:02:55.784 --> 00:02:56.960
by big tobacco,

00:02:56.984 --> 00:03:00.200
who claimed that collecting information
with pencils and clipboards

00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:02.555
is neither precise nor provable.

00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:06.954
The city called me and asked
if our technology could help.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.227
I'm not sure they realized

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:10.499
that our technology
was my Instagram account --

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.562
(Laughter)

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.852
But I said, "Yes, we can."

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:13.892
(Laughter)

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:17.824
"And we can tell you
if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:21.273
Plus, every photograph
is geotagged and time-stamped,

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:22.678
providing you with proof."

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.879
Four days and 5,000 pieces later,

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:31.841
our data was used in court
to not only defend but double the tax,

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:36.188
generating an annual recurring revenue
of four million dollars

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:38.507
for San Francisco to clean itself up.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.056
Now, during that process
I learned two things:

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.634
one, Instagram is not the right tool --

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:45.689
(Laughter)

00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:47.216
so we built an app.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.873
And two, if you think about it,

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:52.514
every city in the world
has a unique litter fingerprint,

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:56.374
and that fingerprint provides
both the source of the problem

00:03:56.398 --> 00:03:58.319
and the path to the solution.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:01.844
If you could generate a revenue stream

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:04.331
just by understanding
the percentage of cigarettes,

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.451
well, what about coffee cups

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:08.181
or soda cans

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:09.619
or plastic bottles?

00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:13.522
If you could fingerprint San Francisco,
well, how about Oakland

00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:15.242
or Amsterdam

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:18.236
or somewhere much closer to home?

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:20.462
And what about brands?

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:22.387
How might they use this data

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:26.623
to align their environmental
and economic interests?

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.678
There's a block in downtown Oakland
that's covered in blight.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.249
The Litterati community got together
and picked up 1,500 pieces.

00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:36.972
And here's what we learned:

00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:40.206
most of that litter came
from a very well-known taco brand.

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:45.135
Most of that brand's litter
were their own hot sauce packets,

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:49.884
and most of those hot sauce packets
hadn't even been opened.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.500
The problem and the path
to the solution --

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:58.485
well, maybe that brand only
gives out hot sauce upon request

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.518
or installs bulk dispensers

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:03.094
or comes up with more
sustainable packaging.

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:06.087
How does a brand take
an environmental hazard,

00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:08.117
turn it into an economic engine

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.909
and become an industry hero?

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.314
If you really want to create change,

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:16.212
there's no better place to start
than with our kids.

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:19.639
A group of fifth graders picked up
1,247 pieces of litter

00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:21.511
just on their school yard.

00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:24.067
And they learned that the most
common type of litter

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.325
were the plastic straw wrappers
from their own cafeteria.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.296
So these kids went
to their principal and asked,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.980
"Why are we still buying straws?"

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:34.741
And they stopped.

00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:38.419
And they learned that individually
they could each make a difference,

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:40.781
but together they created an impact.

00:05:41.323 --> 00:05:45.335
It doesn't matter
if you're a student or a scientist,

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:48.494
whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,

00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:50.959
this is a community for everyone.

00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:56.473
It started because of two little kids
in the Northern California woods,

00:05:56.497 --> 00:05:59.311
and today it's spread across the world.

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.541
And you know how we're getting there?

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:03.765
One piece at a time.

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:05.543
Thank you.

00:06:05.567 --> 00:06:09.185
(Applause)
