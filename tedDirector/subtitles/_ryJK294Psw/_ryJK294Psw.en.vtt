00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.305
As you heard, I'm a physicist.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.314
And I think the way we talk about physics
needs a little modification.

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:22.699
I am from just down the road here;
I don't live here anymore.

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:27.230
But coming from round here means
that I have a northern nana,

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:28.421
my mum's mom.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.472
And Nana is very bright;
she hasn't had much formal education,

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:33.664
but she's sharp.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:37.766
And when I was a second-year undergraduate
studying physics at Cambridge,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.633
I remember spending an afternoon
at Nana's house in Urmston

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:44.039
studying quantum mechanics.

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:46.354
And I had these folders
open in front of me

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.276
with this, you know,
hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.004
And Nana came along,
and she looked at this folder,

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:55.619
and she said, "What's that?"

00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:58.999
I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:03.829
And I tried to explain something
about what was on the page.

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.842
It was to do with the nucleus
and Einstein A and B coefficients.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.656
And Nana looked very impressed.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:11.723
And then she said, "Oh.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.873
What can you do when you know that?"

00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:16.897
(Laughter)

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.544
"Don't know, ma'am."

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:21.632
(Laughter)

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.656
I think I said something about computers,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.758
because it was all
I could think of at the time.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:30.426
But you can broaden that question out,
because it's a very good question --

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.352
"What can you do when you know that?"
when "that" is physics?

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:36.844
And I've come to realize that when
we talk about physics in society

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.270
and our sort of image of it,

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.446
we don't include the things
that we can do when we know that.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.183
Our perception of what physics is
needs a bit of a shift.

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:46.111
Not only does it need a bit of a shift,

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:51.691
but sharing this different perspective
matters for our society,

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:54.923
and I'm not just saying that
because I'm a physicist and I'm biased

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.714
and I think we're the most
important people in the world.

00:01:57.738 --> 00:01:58.889
Honest.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:02.555
So, the image of physics -- we've got
an image problem, let's be honest --

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.393
it hasn't moved on much from this.

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:08.549
This is a very famous photograph
that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.818
This is when the great minds
of physics were grappling

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:15.088
with the nature of determinism

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:17.192
and what it means
only to have a probability

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.927
that a particle might be somewhere,

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.533
and whether any of it was real.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.024
And it was all very difficult.

00:02:22.048 --> 00:02:25.011
And you'll notice they're all
very stern-looking men in suits.

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.945
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying,
"Marie Antoinette,"

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.933
which would be a turn-up for the books --

00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:32.553
Marie Curie, third from the left
on the bottom there,

00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:35.292
she was allowed in,
but had to dress like everybody else.

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:36.341
(Laughter)

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.255
So, this is what physics is like --
there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.452
these are to do with waves and particles.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:45.656
That is an artist's impression
of two black holes colliding,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.968
which makes it look
worth watching, to be honest.

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:50.384
I'm glad I didn't have to write
the risk assessment

00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:51.940
for whatever was going on there.

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:54.317
The point is: this is
the image of physics, right?

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.540
It's weird and difficult,

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:58.688
done by slightly strange people
dressed in a slightly strange way.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:00.713
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:02.547
and fundamentally, why should I care?

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.339
And the problem with that
is that I'm a physicist,

00:03:07.363 --> 00:03:08.836
and I study this.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.146
This -- this is my job, right?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.870
I study the interface
between the atmosphere and the ocean.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.182
The atmosphere is massive,
the ocean is massive,

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:19.307
and the thin layer
that joins them together

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.493
is really important,

00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:23.734
because that's where things go
from one huge reservoir to the other.

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:27.472
You can see that the sea surface --
that was me who took this video --

00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:30.631
the average height of those waves
by the way, was 10 meters.

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.150
So this is definitely physics
happening here --

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.722
there's lots of things --
this is definitely physics.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:39.296
And yet it's not included
in our cultural perception of physics,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.146
and that bothers me.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.498
So what is included
in our cultural perception of physics?

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:47.332
Because I'm a physicist,
there has to be a graph, right?

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:48.512
That's allowed.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.797
We've got time along the bottom here,
from very fast things there,

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:56.262
to things that take a long time over here.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.781
Small things at the bottom,
big things up there.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.830
So, our current cultural image
of physics looks like this.

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:04.375
There's quantum mechanics
down in that corner,

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.399
it's very small, it's very weird,

00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:08.424
it happens very quickly,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.729
and it's a long way down
in the general ...

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.587
on the scale of anything that matters
for everyday life.

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:16.943
And then there's cosmology,
which is up there;

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.278
very large, very far away,

00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:20.302
also very weird.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.326
And if you go to some places

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.414
like black holes
in the beginning of the universe,

00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:28.440
we know that these are frontiers
in physics, right?

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.219
There's lots of work being done
to discover new physics

00:04:31.243 --> 00:04:32.669
in these places.

00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:36.654
But the thing is, you will notice
there's a very large gap in the middle.

00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:38.836
And in that gap, there are many things.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.503
There are planets and toasts
and volcanoes and clouds

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.664
and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins

00:04:43.688 --> 00:04:46.947
and all sorts of things
that make up our everyday life.

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.084
And these are also run by physics,
you'd be surprised --

00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:53.407
there is physics in the middle,
it's just that nobody talks about it.

00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.402
And the thing about all of these
is that they all run

00:04:57.426 --> 00:05:00.957
on a relatively small number
of physical laws,

00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.859
things like Newton's laws of motion,

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:04.046
thermodynamics,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.785
some rotational dynamics.

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.337
The physics in the middle
applies over a huge range,

00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:11.982
from very, very small things
to very, very big things.

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:14.380
You have to try very hard
to get outside of this.

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:18.205
And there is also a frontier
in research physics here,

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.032
it's just that nobody talks about it.

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.733
This is the world of the complex.

00:05:21.757 --> 00:05:24.004
When these laws work together,
they bring about

00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:26.858
the beautiful, messy,
complex world we live in.

00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:30.555
Fundamentally, this is the bit
that really matters to me

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.769
on an everyday basis.

00:05:31.793 --> 00:05:33.972
And this is the bit
that we don't talk about.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:36.330
There's plenty of physics
research going on here.

00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:38.728
But because it doesn't involve
pointing at stars,

00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:40.834
people for some reason
think it's not that.

00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:44.340
Now, the cool thing about this
is that there are so many things

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.364
in this middle bit,

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.222
all following the same physical laws,

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:51.571
that we can see those laws at work

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.595
almost all the time around us.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.034
I've got a little video here.

00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:59.021
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw
and one of them has been boiled.

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:01.045
I want you to tell me which one is which.

00:06:02.553 --> 00:06:04.335
Which one's raw?

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:05.505
(Audience responds)

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.003
The one on the left -- yes!

00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:09.867
And even though you might not
have tried that, you all knew.

00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.441
The reason for that is,
you set them spinning,

00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.648
and when you stop the cooked egg,
the one that's completely solid,

00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:16.824
you stop the entire egg.

00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:19.411
When you stop the other one,
you only stop the shell;

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:22.781
the liquid inside is still rotating
because nothing's made it stop.

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:27.087
And then it pushes the shell round again,
so the egg starts to rotate again.

00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.153
This is brilliant, right?

00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:31.442
It's a demonstration
of something in physics

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:34.812
that we call the law of conservation
of angular momentum,

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:37.558
which basically says
that if you set something spinning

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:38.737
about a fixed axis,

00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:41.856
that it will keep spinning
unless you do something to stop it.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.060
And that's really fundamental
in how the universe works.

00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:47.684
And it's not just eggs that it applies to,

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.520
although it's really useful
if you're the sort of person --

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.487
and apparently, these people do exist --

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.298
who will boil eggs
and then put them back in the fridge.

00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:58.427
Who does that? Don't admit to it --
it's OK. We won't judge you.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.520
But it's also got much
broader applicabilities.

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:03.516
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.732
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field,
which is a very tiny part of the sky.

00:07:06.756 --> 00:07:09.877
Hubble has been floating
in free space for 25 years,

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.469
not touching anything.

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.199
And yet it can point
to a tiny region of sky.

00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:18.525
For 11 and a half days,
it did it in sections,

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:21.203
accurately enough
to take amazing images like this.

00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.386
So the question is:

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.824
How does something
that is not touching anything

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:26.009
know where it is?

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.994
The answer is that right in the middle
of it, it has something

00:07:29.018 --> 00:07:31.389
that, to my great disappointment,
isn't a raw egg,

00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:32.952
but basically does the same job.

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:34.855
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.683
and because of the law
of conservation of angular momentum,

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.281
they keep spinning
with the same axis, indefinitely.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:43.394
Hubble kind of rotates around them,
and so it can orient itself.

00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:47.562
So the same little physical law
we can play with in the kitchen and use,

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:52.139
also explains what makes possible
some of the most advanced technology

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:53.914
of our time.

00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:57.545
So this is the fun bit of physics,
that you learn these patterns

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.130
and then you can apply them
again and again and again.

00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:03.030
And it's really rewarding
when you spot them in new places.

00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:04.547
This is the fun of physics.

00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:09.025
I have shown that egg video
to an audience full of businesspeople once

00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:13.699
and they were all dressed up very smartly
and trying to impress their bosses.

00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:17.502
And I was running out of time,
so I showed the egg video and then said,

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:20.386
"Well, you can work it out,
and ask me afterwards to check."

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.567
Then I left the stage.

00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:22.744
And I had, literally,

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.345
middle-aged grown men
tugging on my sleeve afterwards,

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:27.005
saying, "Is it this? Is it this?"

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:29.033
And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"

00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:30.077
(Laughter)

00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:32.559
The joy that you get
from spotting these patterns

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:34.700
doesn't go away when you're an adult.

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.479
And that's really important,

00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:38.982
because physics is all about patterns,

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:41.652
and a small number of patterns
give you access

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:45.143
to almost all of the physics
in our everyday world.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:48.738
The thing that's best about this
is it involves playing with toys.

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:52.253
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed
as the mundane little things

00:08:52.277 --> 00:08:55.363
that we just give the kids to play with
on a Saturday afternoon

00:08:55.387 --> 00:08:56.552
to keep them quiet.

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:58.832
This is the stuff
that actually really matters,

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:01.880
because this is the laws of the universe
and it applies to eggs

00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:05.183
and toast falling butter-side down
and all sorts of other things,

00:09:05.207 --> 00:09:07.641
just as much as it applies
to modern technology

00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:09.878
and anything else
that's going on in the world.

00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:13.616
So I think we should play
with these patterns.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.855
Basically, there are a small
number of concepts

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:18.884
that you can become familiar with
using things in your kitchen,

00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:21.673
that are really useful
for life in the outside world.

00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:25.254
If you want to learn about thermodynamics,
a duck is a good place to start,

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:27.330
for example, why their feet
don't get cold.

00:09:27.354 --> 00:09:29.905
Once you've got a bit
of thermodynamics with the duck,

00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:31.348
you can also explain fridges.

00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:34.133
Magnets that you can play with
in your kitchen

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.197
get you to wind turbines
and modern energy generation.

00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.265
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always
a good thing to play with.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.568
If you're at a boring party,
fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,

00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:46.592
put them in some lemonade.

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.203
It's got three consequences.

00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:50.594
First thing is, it's quite good
to watch; try it.

00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:53.133
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.

00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:55.520
Thirdly, it brings
the interesting people to you.

00:09:55.544 --> 00:09:56.907
You win on all fronts.

00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.278
And then there's spin
and gas laws and viscosity.

00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:03.794
There's these little patterns,
and they're right around us everywhere.

00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:07.379
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?

00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:11.055
Everybody has access to the same physics;
you don't need a big, posh lab.

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:15.033
When I wrote the book,
I had the chapter on spin.

00:10:15.057 --> 00:10:17.739
I had written a bit
about toast falling butter-side down.

00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:20.835
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine
who's not a scientist,

00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:22.973
for him to read and tell me
what he thought,

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.075
and he took the chapter away.

00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.308
He was working overseas.

00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:30.309
I got this text message back from him
a couple of weeks later,

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:34.542
and it said, "I'm at breakfast
in a posh hotel in Switzerland,

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:37.298
and I really want
to push toast off the table,

00:10:37.322 --> 00:10:39.864
because I don't believe what you wrote."

00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:42.203
And that was the good bit --
he doesn't have to.

00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:45.683
He can push the toast off the table
and try it for himself.

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.544
And so there's two important things
to know about science:

00:10:49.568 --> 00:10:53.882
the fundamental laws we've learned
through experience and experimentation,

00:10:53.906 --> 00:10:55.060
work.

00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:57.066
The day we drop an apple and it goes up,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.006
then we'll have a debate about gravity.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.620
Up to that point,
we basically know how gravity works,

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:03.178
and we can learn the framework.

00:11:03.202 --> 00:11:05.489
Then there's the process
of experimentation:

00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:07.716
having confidence in things,
trying things out,

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.209
critical thinking -- how we move
science forward --

00:11:10.233 --> 00:11:12.233
and you can learn both of those things

00:11:12.257 --> 00:11:15.352
by playing with toys
in the everyday world.

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.523
And it's really important,

00:11:17.547 --> 00:11:19.762
because there's all this talk
about technology,

00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:21.787
we've heard talks about quantum computing

00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.812
and all these mysterious, far-off things.

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:27.670
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies
that are about this size,

00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:30.631
we still walk about,
sit on chairs that are about this size,

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.655
we still live in the physical world.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:36.627
And being familiar with these concepts
means we're not helpless.

00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:39.502
And I think it's really important
that we're not helpless,

00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:41.734
that society feels it can look at things,

00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:44.424
because this isn't
about knowing all the answers.

00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:47.865
It's about having the framework
so you can ask the right questions.

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:51.403
And by playing with these fundamental
little things in everyday life,

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:54.162
we gain the confidence
to ask the right questions.

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.872
So, there's a bigger thing.

00:11:55.896 --> 00:11:57.270
In answer to Nana's question

00:11:57.294 --> 00:11:59.304
about what can you do
when you know that --

00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:01.781
because there's lots of stuff
in the everyday world

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.502
that you can do when you know that,

00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:05.980
especially if you've got
eggs in the fridge --

00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:08.326
there's a much deeper answer.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.514
And so there's all the fun
and the curiosity

00:12:10.538 --> 00:12:12.500
that you could have playing with toys.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:16.072
By the way -- why should kids have
all the fun, right?

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:18.096
All of us can have fun playing with toys,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.120
and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.

00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:22.022
You can blame me, it's fine.

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:27.455
So when it comes to reasons
for studying physics, for example,

00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:30.370
here is the best reason I can think of:

00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:34.226
I think that each of us has
three life-support systems.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.607
We've got our own body, we've got a planet

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.398
and we've got our civilization.

00:12:38.422 --> 00:12:41.461
Each of those is an independent
life-support system,

00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:43.485
keeping us alive in its own way.

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:46.676
And they all run
on the fundamental physical laws

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.100
that you can learn in the kitchen
with eggs and teacups and lemonade,

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:52.003
and everything else you can play with.

00:12:52.027 --> 00:12:53.628
This is the reason, for example,

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:56.557
why something like climate change
is such a serious problem,

00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:59.113
because It's two of these
life-support systems,

00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:00.905
our planet and our civilization,

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:02.884
kind of butting up against each other;

00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:05.800
they're in conflict,
and we need to negotiate that boundary.

00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:08.340
And the fundamental physical laws
that we can learn

00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:10.544
that are the way
the world around us works,

00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:12.988
are the tools at the basis of everything;

00:13:13.012 --> 00:13:14.374
they're the foundation.

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:16.569
There's lots of things
to know about in life,

00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:19.389
but knowing the foundations
is going to get you a long way.

00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:23.054
And I think this, if you're not interested
in having fun with physics

00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:27.129
or anything like that -- strange,
but apparently, these people exist --

00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:31.240
you surely are interested
in keeping yourself alive

00:13:31.264 --> 00:13:33.315
and in how our life-support systems work.

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:38.114
The framework for physics
is remarkably constant;

00:13:38.138 --> 00:13:40.814
it's the same in lots and lots
of things that we measure.

00:13:40.838 --> 00:13:42.676
It's not going to change anytime soon.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.963
They might discover
some new quantum mechanics,

00:13:44.987 --> 00:13:47.643
but apples right here
are still going to fall down.

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.790
So, the question is --

00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:52.103
I get asked sometimes: How do you start?

00:13:52.127 --> 00:13:53.348
What's the place to start

00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:56.628
if you're interested in the physical
world, in not being helpless,

00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:58.489
and in finding some toys to play with?

00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:00.917
Here is my suggestion to you:

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:06.340
the place to start is that moment --
and adults do this --

00:14:06.364 --> 00:14:08.226
you're drifting along somewhere,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.841
and you spot something
and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."

00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:15.489
And then your consciousness goes,
"You're an adult. Keep going."

00:14:15.513 --> 00:14:18.352
And that's the point --
hold that thought --

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:21.004
that bit where your brain went,
"Oh, that's a bit odd,"

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.081
because there's something
there to play with,

00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:24.823
and it's worth you playing with it,

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:26.243
so that's the place to start.

00:14:26.267 --> 00:14:28.633
But if you don't have
any of those little moments

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:30.253
on your way home from this event,

00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:31.962
here are some things to start with.

00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:34.148
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade;
highly entertaining.

00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.172
Watch a coffee spill dry.

00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:38.800
I know that sounds a little bit
like watching paint dry,

00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:42.289
but it does do quite weird things;
it's worth watching.

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:46.508
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties
if there are teacups around.

00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:49.972
There are so many things you can do
to play with teacups, it's brilliant.

00:14:49.996 --> 00:14:53.405
The most obvious one
is to get a teacup, get a spoon,

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:55.747
tap the teacup around the rim and listen,

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.566
and you will hear something strange.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.890
And the other thing is,
push your toast off the table

00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:03.323
because you can,
and you'll learn stuff from it.

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.299
And if you're feeling really ambitious,

00:15:05.323 --> 00:15:09.450
try and push it off in such a way
that it doesn't fall butter-side down,

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.030
which is possible.

00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:13.756
The point of all of this is that,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.873
first of all, we should all
play with toys.

00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:19.321
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate
the physical world for ourselves

00:15:19.345 --> 00:15:20.595
with the tools around us,

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:22.399
because we all have access to them.

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:25.042
It matters, because if we want
to understand society,

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.625
if we want to be good citizens,

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:30.727
we need to understand the framework
on which everything else must be based.

00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:32.770
Playing with toys is great.

00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:35.907
Understanding how to keep
our life-support systems going is great.

00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:38.324
But fundamentally, the thing
that we need to change

00:15:38.348 --> 00:15:40.176
in the way that we talk about physics,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.359
is we need to understand

00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:43.699
that physics isn't out there
with weird people

00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:45.203
and strange hieroglyphics

00:15:45.227 --> 00:15:46.849
for somebody else in a posh lab.

00:15:46.873 --> 00:15:49.923
Physics is right here; it's for us,
and we can all play with it.

00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:51.113
Thank you very much.

00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:53.137
(Applause)
