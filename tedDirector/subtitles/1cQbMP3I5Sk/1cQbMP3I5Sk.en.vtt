00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.460
Thousands of years from now,

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:18.325
we'll look back at the first
century of computing

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.398
as a fascinating but very peculiar time --

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:28.102
the only time in history where humans
were reduced to live in 2D space,

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:32.045
interacting with technology
as if we were machines;

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:37.286
a singular, 100-year period
in the vastness of time

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.998
where humans communicated,

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:42.673
were entertained and managed their lives

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:44.371
from behind a screen.

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:49.976
Today, we spend most of our time
tapping and looking at screens.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:54.349
What happened to interacting
with each other?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.711
I don't know about you, but I feel limited

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:01.283
inside this 2D world
of monitors and pixels.

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.816
And it is this very limitation

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.256
and my desire to connect with people

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.268
that inspires me as a creator.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:11.643
Put simply: I want
to create a new reality,

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:17.374
a reality where technology brings
us infinitely closer to each other,

00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:20.588
a reality where people, not devices,

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:22.080
are the center of everything.

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:29.177
I dream of a reality where technology
senses what we see, touch and feel;

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:33.035
a reality where technology
no longer gets in our way,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.804
but instead embraces who we are.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.932
I dream of technology

00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:40.447
on a human path.

00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:42.886
We have all experienced technology

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.212
that enables people
to act more like people,

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:51.013
products that enable natural interactions,
voice controls or biometrics.

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:58.624
This is the next step in the evolution.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.285
This is Microsoft HoloLens,

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:04.882
the first fully untethered
holographic computer.

00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:09.837
Devices like this will bring
3D holographic content

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:11.780
right into our world,

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:13.861
enhancing the way we experience life

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:16.598
beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:21.257
Now, I'm not thinking
about a distant future.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:23.458
I'm talking about today.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.102
We are already seeing
car companies like Volvo

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.053
designing cars differently with HoloLens;

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:34.808
universities like Case Western
redefining the way medical students learn;

00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.252
and my personal favorite,

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:42.091
NASA is using HoloLens
to let scientists explore planets

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:43.345
holographically.

00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:45.218
Now, this is important.

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:48.636
By bringing holograms into our world,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.285
I'm not just talking about a new device
or a better computer.

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:57.801
I'm talking about freeing ourselves
from the 2D confines

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:00.308
of traditional computing.

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:02.937
Put it this way:

00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:07.181
temporally adjusted, we're like
cave people in computer terms.

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:09.792
We've barely discovered charcoal

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:13.996
and started drawing
the first stick figures in our cave.

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:19.250
Now, this is the perspective
I apply to my work every single day.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.967
And now for the next few minutes,

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:26.290
I invite all of you to apply
the same perspective

00:03:26.314 --> 00:03:27.707
to the journey ahead of us.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.381
Now, as I put this HoloLens on,

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:36.584
let me explain the setup a little bit.

00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:41.980
It's probably the most risky demo
we have ever done on any stage

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.238
with HoloLens,

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:46.562
and I can't think of a better place
to do it than here at TED.

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:50.995
Momentarily, I am going
to be seeing holograms

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.341
right on this stage,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.621
just as clearly as I can see all of you.

00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:58.283
Now at the same time,
we have also this special camera

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:00.003
that just walked in onstage

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:03.259
so that all of you can share
in this experience with me

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.695
up on all the monitors.

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.272
So let's start our journey.

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.732
And what better place
to begin our journey,

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:12.859
than in the computer cave of 2D.

00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:19.169
Let's explore the world
all around us with this new lens,

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:22.607
and understand the computer world
from a brand new perspective.

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:28.123
The computer universe
is both marvelous and primitive.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:31.548
It's a universe based on causality.

00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:35.280
As developers, we dream
the different causes

00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:37.580
and then we program the different effects.

00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:40.965
Double click on an icon, that's a cause.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.243
Open an application, that's an effect.

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:49.511
Now when we compare this
to our physical universe,

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:51.550
it is overly constraining,

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.018
because our universe is not digital.

00:04:54.747 --> 00:04:56.638
Our universe is analog.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:05:00.777
Our universe doesn't think
in terms of zero or one,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.979
true or false, or black or white.

00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:08.909
We exist in a world
governed by quantum physics,

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:13.276
a universe of zero and one
both at the same time,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.392
a reality based on infinite
probabilities and shades of gray.

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:22.946
You can see how these two worlds collide.

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:29.051
So why are screens so pervasive
in our analog life?

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:32.967
We see screens from the moment we wake up,

00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:34.672
to the moment we fall asleep.

00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:36.334
Why?

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:39.821
I think it's because computers
give us superpowers.

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:44.099
Within the digital universe,
we have the power to displace space

00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:45.874
and the power to displace time.

00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:49.717
It doesn't matter if you're using
technology for entertainment,

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.966
productivity or communication.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.861
Think of it this way:

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.265
let's all go home tonight

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.955
and watch our favorite show on television.

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:02.004
This is theater -- time
and space displaced.

00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:04.734
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,

00:06:04.758 --> 00:06:08.075
I'm going to immediately call
my lovely family in Seattle.

00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:13.142
That's displacement of space.

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:16.311
Now, these are such great superpowers

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:19.284
that we put up with
the two-dimensional limitations

00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:21.097
of our current digital world.

00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:22.636
But what if we didn't have to?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.360
What if we could have
these same digital powers

00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:29.005
in our world?

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:32.362
You can already see glimmers of this,

00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:35.038
but I believe our children's children

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:39.005
will grow up in a world
devoid of 2D technology.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:42.494
It's remarkable to dream of this world,

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:46.707
a world where technology
truly understands us --

00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.261
where we live, work and communicate --

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:52.407
with tools that enhance
the human experience,

00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:56.618
not machines that limit our humanity.

00:06:58.642 --> 00:06:59.896
So how do we get there?

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:05.272
For me, the answer required
looking at the problem

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:06.771
from a different perspective.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.736
It required sensing the world
from the perspective of a machine.

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:18.031
If you're a machine trying
to sense our world,

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:20.359
how would you actually
break the problem down?

00:07:21.137 --> 00:07:23.832
You'd probably try to classify things

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.021
as a human,

00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:27.380
an environment

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:30.189
or an object.

00:07:31.973 --> 00:07:36.202
But how would that machine
then interact with reality?

00:07:37.063 --> 00:07:38.688
And I can think of three ways.

00:07:38.712 --> 00:07:40.878
First, as a machine,

00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:44.820
I would observe or I would input reality.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:48.529
Speech recognition
and biometric authentication

00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:51.813
are great examples of a machine
interacting with humans

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.552
from an input perspective.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:56.772
Secondly, as a machine,

00:07:56.796 --> 00:08:01.907
I could place digital information,
or output information,

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:03.096
into reality.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:08.611
Holograms are examples of a machine
interacting with an environment

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:10.095
from an output perspective.

00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:13.086
Finally, as a machine,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.642
I could exchange energy
with the world via haptics.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.392
Now, imagine being able to feel
the temperature of a virtual object,

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:25.635
or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:28.492
and having it push you back
with equal force.

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:30.676
With this perspective,

00:08:31.186 --> 00:08:36.148
we are able to collapse reality
into a simple matrix.

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:37.323
Now here's a secret:

00:08:37.347 --> 00:08:39.405
as an engineer, I get really excited

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.283
anytime I can reduce
something to the matrix.

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.822
From self-driving cars

00:08:44.846 --> 00:08:46.435
to smartphones

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.781
to this holographic computer on my head,

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:52.587
machines are becoming capable
of understanding our world.

00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:55.828
And they are starting to interact with us

00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:58.967
in significantly more personal ways.

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:03.822
Now, imagine having granular control

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:05.682
over everything in the world.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.465
Move the dial one way,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.145
and you get reality.

00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:15.351
Move the dial the other way,

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:20.103
and you get virtual reality.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:26.839
Now, imagine dialing
your entire environment

00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:29.996
between virtual and real worlds.

00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:35.877
I love it down here.

00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:40.130
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you

00:09:40.154 --> 00:09:43.564
and dial from real humans into elves.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.524
When technology truly
understands our world,

00:09:47.548 --> 00:09:51.195
it will again transform
the ways we interact,

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:54.147
the ways we work and the ways we play.

00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:00.949
Less than half a century ago,

00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:03.877
two courageous men landed on the moon,

00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:08.507
using computers that were less powerful
than the phones in your pockets.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.221
Six hundred million humans watched them

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:15.008
on grainy, black-and-white televisions.

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:16.737
And the world?

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:19.491
The world was mesmerized.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.356
Now imagine how our children
and their children

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:28.523
will experience the continued
exploration of space

00:10:28.547 --> 00:10:32.498
with technology
that understands this world.

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:37.689
We already live in a world where
real-time universal translators exist.

00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:43.309
And I can squint, and I can already
see holographic telepresence

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:44.507
in our near future.

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:48.158
In fact, since we've been lucky
with our demo so far,

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:50.491
let's try doing something else
even more crazy.

00:10:51.153 --> 00:10:53.906
I invite you to experience,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.967
for the first time anywhere in the world,

00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.476
here on the TED stage,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.818
a real-life holographic teleportation,

00:11:03.953 --> 00:11:07.660
between me and my friend,
Dr. Jeffrey Norris,

00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:10.482
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:12.540
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.

00:11:14.514 --> 00:11:15.680
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.

00:11:15.704 --> 00:11:18.807
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.
How are you doing today, Jeff?

00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:20.934
(Applause)

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.022
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:26.498
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,
Jeff, about where you are?

00:11:28.197 --> 00:11:31.198
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.

00:11:31.222 --> 00:11:34.103
I'm standing in a room across the street,

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:37.131
while I'm standing on this stage with you,

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:41.957
while I'm standing on Mars,
a hundred million miles away.

00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:45.673
AK: Wow, a hundred million
miles away. This is crazy!

00:11:45.697 --> 00:11:48.483
Can you tell us a little bit more
about where all this data

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.196
from Mars is coming from?

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:53.457
JN: Absolutely.

00:11:53.481 --> 00:11:57.567
This is a precise
holographic replica of Mars,

00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:00.771
built from data captured
by the Curiosity Mars Rover,

00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:03.850
that I can explore as easily
as a place on Earth.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:08.310
Humans are natural explorers.

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:10.895
We can instantly
understand an environment,

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.666
just by being present in it.

00:12:13.773 --> 00:12:15.793
We've built tools like our Mars Rover

00:12:15.817 --> 00:12:19.417
to extend our vision
and lengthen our reach.

00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:21.552
But for decades,

00:12:21.576 --> 00:12:25.541
we've explored from a seat
behind screens and keyboards.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.628
Now, we're leaping over all of that,

00:12:29.652 --> 00:12:32.855
over the giant antennas
and the relay satellites

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:35.154
and the vastness between worlds

00:12:35.178 --> 00:12:40.286
to take our first steps on this landscape
as if we were truly there.

00:12:41.502 --> 00:12:44.090
Today, a group of scientists
on our mission

00:12:44.114 --> 00:12:47.498
are seeing Mars as never before --

00:12:47.522 --> 00:12:50.839
an alien world made
a little more familiar,

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:54.418
because they're finally exploring it
as humans should.

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:59.911
But our dreams don't have to end
with making it just like being there.

00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:02.349
When we dial this real world
to the virtual,

00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:04.672
we can do magical things.

00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:07.483
We can see in invisible wavelengths

00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:10.292
or teleport to the top of a mountain.

00:13:10.882 --> 00:13:15.447
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals
in a rock just by touching it.

00:13:17.003 --> 00:13:18.661
We're taking the first steps.

00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:22.927
But we want the whole world
to join us in taking the next,

00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:25.714
because this is not a journey for a few,

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.253
but for all of us.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.225
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.

00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:32.986
Thank you so much for joining us
on the TED stage today.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:39.723
(Applause)

00:13:39.747 --> 00:13:42.459
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.

00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:43.656
AK: Bye, Jeff.

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:56.866
(Applause)

00:13:57.908 --> 00:14:01.121
I dream about this future

00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:02.873
every single day.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.831
I take inspiration from our ancestors.

00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:09.380
We used to live in tribes
where we interacted,

00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:11.800
communicated and worked together.

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:17.502
We are all beginning to build technology
that will enable us to return

00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:20.849
to the humanity that brought us
where we are today --

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:26.536
technology that will let us stop living
inside this 2D world

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.568
of monitors and pixels,

00:14:28.592 --> 00:14:33.339
and let us start remembering
what it feels like

00:14:33.363 --> 00:14:36.949
to live in our 3D world.

00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:41.526
It's a phenomenal time to be human.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.320
Thank you.

00:14:43.344 --> 00:14:48.413
(Applause)

00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:50.934
Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
I have some questions.

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.109
AK: OK.

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:54.555
HW: So there's been
some talk in the press.

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:57.605
And I'll just ask you straight,
then we have a straight answer.

00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:00.311
There's been talk about the difference
between the demos

00:15:00.335 --> 00:15:02.517
and the reality of the commercial product.

00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:04.492
Talk about this field of view issue.

00:15:04.516 --> 00:15:08.835
Is this type of experience what someone
who buys the product will get?

00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:10.818
AK: It's a great question,

00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:13.493
Or, said better, this is a question
we've been receiving

00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:16.180
in the media for possibly the last year.

00:15:16.204 --> 00:15:18.951
If you do your research,
I haven't answered that question.

00:15:18.975 --> 00:15:20.381
I've purposely ignored it,

00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:22.919
because ultimately,
it's the wrong question to ask.

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:29.959
That's the equivalent of me showing
holograms to someone for the first time,

00:15:29.983 --> 00:15:33.793
and you then saying,
"What's the size of your television?"

00:15:33.817 --> 00:15:36.511
The field of view for the product
is almost irrelevant.

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:40.033
What we should be talking about
is the density of lights,

00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:41.843
or radiance, that shows up.

00:15:41.867 --> 00:15:45.238
Better said, what the angular resolution
is of the things that you see.

00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.262
So from that perspective, what you saw --

00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:49.349
you know, the camera
is wearing a HoloLens.

00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:51.357
So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.

00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:54.947
HW: But the camera has a different lens
on it than our eye. Right?

00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:57.891
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.836
It's seeing a much wider view
than the human eye is.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.165
So if you think about the points of light
that show up radially

00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:06.703
from the vision of the camera,

00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:08.448
which is the thing that matters:

00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:11.030
how many points of light
can I get in a given volume?

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:15.181
That's the same as I get
on this HoloLens as I will on that one.

00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:20.186
Now, this camera sees
a much wider view of the world, right?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.433
HW: Jesus Christ!

00:16:21.457 --> 00:16:22.458
(Laughter)

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.561
AK: He did show up!
I told you he'd show up.

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:25.784
Come this way.

00:16:25.808 --> 00:16:27.672
(Laughter)

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:28.918
HW: Oh, shit.

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:31.731
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:35.817
HW: I knew something was happening,
but I really wasn't sure what.

00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:37.588
AK: So in short: to be super crisp,

00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:40.628
the camera that you see on the screen
has a wider field of view

00:16:40.652 --> 00:16:41.850
than the human eye.

00:16:41.874 --> 00:16:45.081
But the angular resolution
of the holograms that you see,

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:49.074
the points of light per unit of area,

00:16:49.098 --> 00:16:50.264
are actually the same.

00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:53.427
HW: So you spent -- Jeff,
I'll get to you in a minute --

00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:58.031
so you spent a lot of time
mapping the stage --

00:16:58.055 --> 00:16:59.405
AK: That's right.

00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:00.603
HW: So help me out here:

00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.596
if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.557
I don't need to map my apartment, right?

00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:08.694
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time
at about five frames per second,

00:17:08.718 --> 00:17:11.119
with this technology
that we call spatial mapping.

00:17:11.143 --> 00:17:13.170
So in your home, as soon as you put it on,

00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:16.124
holograms will start showing up,
and you'll start placing them

00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:17.939
and they'll start learning your home.

00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:21.472
In a stage environment where we're trying
to get something on my head

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:23.647
to communicate with something over there

00:17:23.671 --> 00:17:27.642
with all of the wireless connectivity
that usually brings all conferences down,

00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:31.630
we don't take the risk
of trying to do this live.

00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:35.081
So what we do is pre-map the stage
at five frames per second

00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:37.129
with the same spatial-mapping technology

00:17:37.153 --> 00:17:39.140
that you'll use with the product at home,

00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:40.315
and then we store it,

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:43.793
so that when there's shenanigans
of wireless in an environment like this,

00:17:43.817 --> 00:17:46.834
between the camera's HoloLens
and the one on my head,

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.451
we don't have things disappear.

00:17:48.475 --> 00:17:51.904
Because ultimately, the holograms
are coming from this HoloLens,

00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:53.968
and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.

00:17:53.992 --> 00:17:55.917
So if I lose connectivity,

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.468
you would stop seeing
beautiful things on the screen.

00:17:58.492 --> 00:18:00.055
HW: And it was beautiful.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.254
Um ... Jeff?

00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:03.713
JN: Yes?

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.028
HW: Hi.

00:18:07.543 --> 00:18:08.794
AK: I'll take a step back.

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.748
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,

00:18:11.772 --> 00:18:14.279
you were here, you were
in a room across the street.

00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:18.505
Tell me more about the fact that,
with holograms, you have sight

00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:21.230
but you don't have touch,
you don't have smell.

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:23.790
Is this scientifically useful now?

00:18:24.824 --> 00:18:26.552
That's my question for a hologram.

00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:28.840
JN: Thanks for the question.

00:18:28.864 --> 00:18:31.377
Absolutely, I believe
that these technologies

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:33.425
are scientifically useful right now,

00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:38.053
and that's why we're using them
in multiple parts of our work at NASA.

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:41.696
So we're using it to improve
the ways that we explore Mars.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.181
We're also using it for our astronauts
on the space station.

00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:47.657
We're even using it now to design

00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:49.866
the next generation of our spacecraft.

00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:53.868
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away.
Thank you very much.

00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:56.101
(Laughter)

00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:59.612
Alex, really, that was amazing.
Thank you so much.

00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:00.794
AK: Thank you.

00:19:00.818 --> 00:19:02.079
HW: Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:02.103 --> 00:19:04.669
(Applause)
