Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.924
I live in South Central.

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:21.067
This is South Central:

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:23.937
liquor stores,

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:26.312
fast food,

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:28.656
vacant lots.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.338
So the city planners, they get together and they figure

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.584
they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.752
so they change it to South Los Angeles,

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:40.634
like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.344
This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.512
Liquor stores,

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.824
fast food,

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:51.465
vacant lots.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:54.936
Just like 26.5 million other Americans,

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:57.496
I live in a food desert,

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.560
South Central Los Angeles,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.761
home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:09.200
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.701
People are dying from curable diseases

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.536
in South Central Los Angeles.

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:17.137
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:20.404
is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:24.004
which is probably eight, 10 miles away.

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.464
I got tired of seeing this happening.

00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:29.572
And I was wondering, how would you feel

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:32.860
if you had no access to healthy food,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.740
if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.400
that the present food system has on your neighborhood?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.068
I see wheelchairs bought and sold

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.137
like used cars.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:48.161
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:51.556
And I figured, this has to stop.

00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:57.382
So I figured that the problem is the solution.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:01.106
Food is the problem and food is the solution.

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:04.036
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:08.244
to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:12.796
So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.188
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:18.572
It's 150 feet by 10 feet.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.020
Thing is, it's owned by the city.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.596
But you have to maintain it.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:28.108
So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,

00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.951
since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.852
And this is how I decided to maintain it.

00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:37.838
So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together

00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:40.190
and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.300
you know, the whole nine, vegetables.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.271
What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:50.110
where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.439
from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.271
and everything we do is free.

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:57.373
And the garden, it was beautiful.

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:59.823
And then somebody complained.

00:02:59.823 --> 00:03:02.199
The city came down on me,

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.511
and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,

00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:09.139
which this citation was turning into a warrant.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.671
And I'm like, "Come on, really?

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.415
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:17.827
that you could care less about?" (Laughter)

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.167
And I was like, "Cool. Bring it."

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.362
Because this time it wasn't coming up.

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:28.374
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.491
and talked to the councilman,

00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:33.087
and one of the Green Grounds members,

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:35.905
they put up a petition on Change.org,

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.758
and with 900 signatures, we were a success.

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:40.834
We had a victory on our hands.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:44.331
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse

00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:46.977
and love what we're doing.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:49.501
I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:54.346
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.

00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:59.704
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.

00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:02.726
That's 20 Central Parks.

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:10.045
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.998
Why in the hell would they not okay this?

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:19.113
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:21.822
When one dollar's worth of green beans

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:25.380
will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.057
It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:32.198
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.

00:04:32.198 --> 00:04:39.198
(Applause)

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:42.070
See, I have a legacy in South Central.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.799
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:51.062
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality

00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:53.926
that was manufactured for me by some other people,

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.534
and I'm manufacturing my own reality.

00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:59.046
See, I'm an artist.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:03.150
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.726
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:11.158
me, I beautify lawns, parkways.

00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:15.068
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:17.263
and the plants and the trees,

00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:20.945
that's my embellishment for that cloth.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:26.986
You'd be surprised what the soil could do

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.521
if you let it be your canvas.

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:32.041
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is

00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.049
and how it affects people.

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:37.721
So what happened?

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:42.792
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.818
a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.

00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:50.699
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.239
We are the soil.

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:00.782
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.

00:06:00.782 --> 00:06:05.016
Gardening is the most therapeutic

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:07.960
and defiant act you can do,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.452
especially in the inner city.

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:13.196
Plus you get strawberries.

00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:16.654
(Laughter)

00:06:16.654 --> 00:06:19.032
I remember this time,

00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:21.341
there was this mother and a daughter came,

00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:24.808
it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,

00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:28.272
and I came out and they looked so ashamed.

00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:31.960
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.696
and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.

00:06:34.696 --> 00:06:36.707
This is on the street for a reason.

00:06:36.707 --> 00:06:40.198
It made me feel ashamed to see people

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:42.781
that were this close to me that were hungry,

00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:45.920
and this only reinforced why I do this,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.889
and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.376
people are going to steal your food?"

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.577
And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:55.170
That's why it's on the street.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.880
That's the whole idea.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.675
I want them to take it, but at the same time,

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:03.678
I want them to take back their health."

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:06.221
There's another time when I put

00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:11.664
a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:14.615
These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:17.240
It was cool, and they just shared the stories

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.096
about how this affected them and how

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:22.888
they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,

00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:26.314
and it was just cool to see how this changed them,

00:07:26.314 --> 00:07:32.019
if it was only for that one moment.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.882
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant

00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:36.633
maybe 20 gardens.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:40.898
We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins

00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:43.663
and participate, and it's all volunteers.

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:47.290
If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.554
(Laughter)

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:53.530
If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.864
But when none of this is presented to them,

00:07:56.864 --> 00:08:00.490
if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.034
they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:06.939
I see young people

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.050
and they want to work,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.171
but they're in this thing where they're caught up --

00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:15.778
I see kids of color and they're just on this track

00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:18.713
that's designed for them,

00:08:18.713 --> 00:08:20.746
that leads them to nowhere.

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:23.421
So with gardening, I see an opportunity

00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:25.567
where we can train these kids

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.564
to take over their communities,

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:32.408
to have a sustainable life.

00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:34.527
And when we do this, who knows?

00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:37.751
We might produce the next George Washington Carver.

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.036
but if we don't change the composition of the soil,

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:41.645
we will never do this.

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.587
Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:48.587
I want to plant a whole block of gardens

00:08:48.587 --> 00:08:51.975
where people can share in the food in the same block.

00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:54.236
I want to take shipping containers

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:56.932
and turn them into healthy cafes.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.324
Now don't get me wrong.

00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:01.602
I'm not talking about no free shit,

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:04.955
because free is not sustainable.

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:06.860
The funny thing about sustainability,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.617
you have to sustain it.

00:09:08.617 --> 00:09:12.774
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:15.012
What I'm talking about is putting people to work,

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:18.115
and getting kids off the street, and letting them know

00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:23.067
the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:25.405
opening farmer's markets.

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:27.498
So what I want to do here,

00:09:27.498 --> 00:09:30.204
we gotta make this sexy.

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:34.444
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,

00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:36.163
gangstas, gangsta gardeners.

00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:40.499
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.

00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:42.352
If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:46.772
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?

00:09:46.772 --> 00:09:49.956
And let that be your weapon of choice.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:56.900
(Applause)

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.523
So basically, if you want to meet with me,

00:10:02.523 --> 00:10:05.656
you know, if you want to meet,

00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:09.453
don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs

00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:13.259
and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.487
where you talk about doing some shit.

00:10:16.487 --> 00:10:19.641
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.921
with your shovel so we can plant some shit.

00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.105
Peace. Thank you.

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:30.249
(Applause)

00:10:30.249 --> 00:10:34.249
Thank you. (Applause)
