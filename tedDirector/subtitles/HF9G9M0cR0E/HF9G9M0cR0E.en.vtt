00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I became an inventor by accident. 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.330
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
was working at the University of Washington, 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
any of the cool stuff we've got now. 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And it was an arm that, 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.330
went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm. 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
and I got really lucky after that. 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And without giving you too much of a tirade, 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today: 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.330
my 44th invention. No, that's not true either. 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention. 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
I call this hypersonic sound. 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes, 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
but I want to make an analogy before I do

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
to this.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.330
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say, 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
That's really cool, but what's it good for? 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
And I say, What is the light bulb good for? 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy. 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
Hasn't changed that much. 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Light came out of it in every direction. 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
Before the light bulb was invented, 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
focus it a little bit; 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
put lenses in front of it,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
focus it a little bit better.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
that were totally focused. 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, think about where the world would be today 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
if we had the light bulb,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
but you couldn't focus light;

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.330
if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
You turn on the loudspeaker,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
the sound just kind of goes where it wants.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
it's pretty much every direction.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
A little bit of differential, but not much.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.330
we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
or computers, or T.V. sets,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
of what the importance is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
of being able to focus light.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.330
Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
I thought it was about time that we figure out

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
a way to put sound where you want to.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
I have a couple of units.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
small version, over your head --

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
(Applause)

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.330
The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:43.330
(Applause)

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.330
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
They tried this back in the '60s

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
and were too smart, and so they gave up.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
But they want to use it -- seriously.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
There's a mix an inventor has to have.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
You have to be kind of smart,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
Too many other smart people out there. So.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
I just happened to get my education in a little different way.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
I'm not at all against education.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
when they get educated, lose it:

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
And we're living in a great time right now,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
because almost everything's being explored anew.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
virtually nothing --

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
and I mean this honestly --

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
has been invented yet.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
We're just starting.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track --

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
They know that when you watch T.V. at home,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
because there are so many choices

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.330
you can change channels, miss their commercials.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.330
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.330
every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
you get to watch it for free;

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
when you want to hear the sound, you pay.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.330
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
where when you step in the line in the supermarket --

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
you'll be watching TV.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
And hopefully they'll be sensitive

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
if you don't want to hear it,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.330
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.330
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
I have been really lucky with this technology:

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.330
all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
They have literally beat a path to our door.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
We've been selling it since about last September, October,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
and it's been immensely gratifying.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
but this unit, with the electronics and everything,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
We expect by this time next year,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.330
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.330
Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.330
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.330
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
And the sound that you're hearing,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
is made out in front of it, in the air.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.330
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
You turn up the volume just a little bit --

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.330
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.330
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.330
I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
I'm having an effect on the pressure,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
which means during the making of that sine wave,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
All of audio as we know it

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.330
is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.330
Linearity means higher quality sound.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.330
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.330
it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.330
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
but it's so predictable

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.330
that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
Instead of being made on the face of the cone,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
it's made at literally billions of little independent points

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.330
along this narrow column in the air,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
and so when I aim it towards you,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
what you hear is made right next to your ears.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
I said we can shorten the column,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
we can spread it out to cover the couch.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
When you listen to stereo on your home system,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
your both ears hear both speakers.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
Turn on the left speaker sometime

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
So, the stage is more restricted --

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.330
Because the sound is made in the air along this column,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
it does not follow the inverse square law,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
which says it drops off about two thirds

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
every time you double the distance:

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
and the guy in the front row gets the same level

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.330
Isn't that terrific?

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
in having companies catch the vision of this,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.330
from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.330
and a separate system in the back --

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.330
(Laughter)

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
I was seeing if you were listening.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.330
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
or their rap music or whatever.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
is really starting to catch on.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.330
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.330
It also works five times better underwater.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.330
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
where you can put fake troop movements

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
quarter of a mile away on a hillside.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
(Laughter)

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
(Laughter)

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:51.330
I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
that can look at their countenance,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.330
and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.330
from 100 yards away when they play this thing.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.330
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Pain is 120.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.330
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.330
and there can be a public beach just off to the side,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
and they don't even know it's turned on.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.330
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.330
We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
you're over there, and it's there.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
I have a bunch of other inventions.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.330
I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.330
and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
We're using very short wavelengths.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
When you run very short wavelengths,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
and there's more energy coming out of the antenna

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
than there is the backscatter from the ground

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.330
I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
Turn it on; turn it off.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.330
That's a fluorescent tube refined."

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.330
when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
(Laughter)

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:37.330
Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.330
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
in my attic at my house,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
and one of the many designs which they have now

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
is still the same design I drew way back when.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.330
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.330
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
Let me give you, in the last minute,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
one more quick demo of this guy,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
for those of you that haven't heard it.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
Can never tell if it's on.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
Getting it over there?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.330
Get the cameraman.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Yeah, there you go.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
Thank you once again.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Appreciate it very much.
