00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:14.463
A few years ago,

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:17.257
with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.539
I invented a new technology
for editing genomes.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.207
It's called CRISPR-Cas9.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.446
The CRISPR technology allows
scientists to make changes

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.325
to the DNA in cells

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.255
that could allow us
to cure genetic disease.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:34.688
You might be interested to know

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.496
that the CRISPR technology came about
through a basic research project

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.463
that was aimed at discovering
how bacteria fight viral infections.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.212
Bacteria have to deal with viruses
in their environment,

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:49.900
and we can think about a viral infection
like a ticking time bomb --

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.282
a bacterium has only a few minutes
to defuse the bomb

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:54.916
before it gets destroyed.

00:00:55.284 --> 00:01:00.674
So, many bacteria have in their cells
an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:04.344
that allows them to detect
viral DNA and destroy it.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:09.116
Part of the CRISPR system
is a protein called Cas9,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.089
that's able to seek out, cut
and eventually degrade viral DNA

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:16.375
in a specific way.

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:18.556
And it was through our research

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.237
to understand the activity
of this protein, Cas9,

00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.092
that we realized that we could
harness its function

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:28.522
as a genetic engineering technology --

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:35.497
a way for scientists to delete or insert
specific bits of DNA into cells

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.552
with incredible precision --

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.243
that would offer opportunities

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:42.339
to do things that really haven't
been possible in the past.

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:45.246
The CRISPR technology
has already been used

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.354
to change the DNA in the cells
of mice and monkeys,

00:01:50.378 --> 00:01:52.003
other organisms as well.

00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:54.282
Chinese scientists showed recently

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:56.465
that they could even use
the CRISPR technology

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.118
to change genes in human embryos.

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:02.285
And scientists in Philadelphia showed
they could use CRISPR

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:07.152
to remove the DNA
of an integrated HIV virus

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:09.371
from infected human cells.

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:13.348
The opportunity to do this kind
of genome editing

00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:16.655
also raises various ethical issues
that we have to consider,

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.647
because this technology can be employed
not only in adult cells,

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.274
but also in the embryos of organisms,

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:26.298
including our own species.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.765
And so, together with my colleagues,

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:33.277
I've called for a global conversation
about the technology that I co-invented,

00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:37.841
so that we can consider all of the ethical
and societal implications

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.589
of a technology like this.

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.995
What I want to do now is tell you
what the CRISPR technology is,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.473
what it can do,

00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:47.742
where we are today

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.788
and why I think we need to take
a prudent path forward

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:53.165
in the way that we employ this technology.

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:58.831
When viruses infect a cell,
they inject their DNA.

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:00.839
And in a bacterium,

00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:05.728
the CRISPR system allows that DNA
to be plucked out of the virus,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:09.597
and inserted in little bits
into the chromosome --

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.571
the DNA of the bacterium.

00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:17.287
And these integrated bits of viral DNA
get inserted at a site called CRISPR.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:24.027
CRISPR stands for clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats.

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:25.052
(Laughter)

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:28.449
A big mouthful -- you can see why
we use the acronym CRISPR.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.878
It's a mechanism that allows cells
to record, over time,

00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:35.584
the viruses they have been exposed to.

00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:40.291
And importantly, those bits of DNA
are passed on to the cells' progeny,

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:44.848
so cells are protected from viruses
not only in one generation,

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:47.221
but over many generations of cells.

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:51.530
This allows the cells
to keep a record of infection,

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.493
and as my colleague,
Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:59.473
the CRISPR locus is effectively
a genetic vaccination card in cells.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:05.070
Once those bits of DNA have been inserted
into the bacterial chromosome,

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:09.293
the cell then makes a little copy
of a molecule called RNA,

00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:11.332
which is orange in this picture,

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:16.073
that is an exact replicate
of the viral DNA.

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:18.838
RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:22.815
and it allows interaction
with DNA molecules

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.838
that have a matching sequence.

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:29.167
So those little bits of RNA
from the CRISPR locus

00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.980
associate -- they bind --
to protein called Cas9,

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:34.939
which is white in the picture,

00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:39.182
and form a complex that functions
like a sentinel in the cell.

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:42.620
It searches through all
of the DNA in the cell,

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:46.896
to find sites that match
the sequences in the bound RNAs.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.555
And when those sites are found --

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.049
as you can see here,
the blue molecule is DNA --

00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:54.922
this complex associates with that DNA

00:04:54.946 --> 00:05:00.248
and allows the Cas9 cleaver
to cut up the viral DNA.

00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:02.628
It makes a very precise break.

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:08.496
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA
sentinel complex

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.701
like a pair of scissors
that can cut DNA --

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:14.961
it makes a double-stranded break
in the DNA helix.

00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:18.967
And importantly,
this complex is programmable,

00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:24.191
so it can be programmed to recognize
particular DNA sequences,

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.242
and make a break in the DNA at that site.

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:29.508
As I'm going to tell you now,

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:34.308
we recognized that that activity
could be harnessed for genome engineering,

00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:38.559
to allow cells to make
a very precise change to the DNA

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:41.055
at the site where
this break was introduced.

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:42.773
That's sort of analogous

00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:45.505
to the way that we use
a word-processing program

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.809
to fix a typo in a document.

00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:54.359
The reason we envisioned using
the CRISPR system for genome engineering

00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:58.002
is because cells have the ability
to detect broken DNA

00:05:58.026 --> 00:05:59.218
and repair it.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.711
So when a plant or an animal cell detects
a double-stranded break in its DNA,

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.332
it can fix that break,

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:09.883
either by pasting together
the ends of the broken DNA

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:14.017
with a little, tiny change
in the sequence of that position,

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:20.324
or it can repair the break by integrating
a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.

00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:26.027
So if we have a way to introduce
double-stranded breaks into DNA

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.631
at precise places,

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:30.464
we can trigger cells
to repair those breaks,

00:06:30.488 --> 00:06:35.511
by either the disruption or incorporation
of new genetic information.

00:06:35.936 --> 00:06:39.178
So if we were able to program
the CRISPR technology

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:41.525
to make a break in DNA

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:47.818
at the position at or near a mutation
causing cystic fibrosis, for example,

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:51.347
we could trigger cells
to repair that mutation.

00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:57.567
Genome engineering is actually not new,
it's been in development since the 1970s.

00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.342
We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:01.961
for copying DNA,

00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:04.365
and even for manipulating DNA.

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.105
And these technologies
were very promising,

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.535
but the problem was
that they were either inefficient,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.892
or they were difficult enough to use

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:19.718
that most scientists had not adopted them
for use in their own laboratories,

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:23.907
or certainly for many
clinical applications.

00:07:24.722 --> 00:07:31.722
So, the opportunity to take a technology
like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:35.102
because of its relative simplicity.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:38.895
We can think of older
genome engineering technologies

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.578
as similar to having
to rewire your computer

00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:46.372
each time you want to run
a new piece of software,

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:50.160
whereas the CRISPR technology
is like software for the genome,

00:07:50.184 --> 00:07:53.670
we can program it easily,
using these little bits of RNA.

00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:57.751
So once a double-stranded
break is made in DNA,

00:07:57.775 --> 00:07:59.862
we can induce repair,

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:03.332
and thereby potentially achieve
astounding things,

00:08:03.356 --> 00:08:07.515
like being able to correct mutations
that cause sickle cell anemia

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:09.890
or cause Huntington's Disease.

00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:13.375
I actually think that the first
applications of the CRISPR technology

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:15.668
are going to happen in the blood,

00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:20.445
where it's relatively easier
to deliver this tool into cells,

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:22.590
compared to solid tissues.

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:26.309
Right now, a lot of the work
that's going on

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:30.302
applies to animal models
of human disease, such as mice.

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:33.595
The technology is being used to make
very precise changes

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:38.790
that allow us to study the way
that these changes in the cell's DNA

00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:43.134
affect either a tissue or,
in this case, an entire organism.

00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:44.722
Now in this example,

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:48.539
the CRISPR technology
was used to disrupt a gene

00:08:48.563 --> 00:08:51.330
by making a tiny change in the DNA

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:55.798
in a gene that is responsible
for the black coat color of these mice.

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:01.237
Imagine that these white mice
differ from their pigmented litter-mates

00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:05.928
by just a tiny change at one gene
in the entire genome,

00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:07.942
and they're otherwise completely normal.

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:10.857
And when we sequence the DNA
from these animals,

00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:13.507
we find that the change in the DNA

00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.673
has occurred at exactly the place
where we induced it,

00:09:16.697 --> 00:09:18.459
using the CRISPR technology.

00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:22.386
Additional experiments
are going on in other animals

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.505
that are useful for creating models
for human disease,

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:28.132
such as monkeys.

00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:31.382
And here we find
that we can use these systems

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:35.208
to test the application of this technology
in particular tissues,

00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:40.305
for example, figuring out how to deliver
the CRISPR tool into cells.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.477
We also want to understand better

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:46.128
how to control the way
that DNA is repaired after it's cut,

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:51.833
and also to figure out how to control
and limit any kind of off-target,

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:55.094
or unintended effects
of using the technology.

00:09:56.356 --> 00:10:02.506
I think that we will see
clinical application of this technology,

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.042
certainly in adults,

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:05.669
within the next 10 years.

00:10:05.693 --> 00:10:08.827
I think that it's likely
that we will see clinical trials

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.280
and possibly even approved
therapies within that time,

00:10:12.304 --> 00:10:15.017
which is a very exciting thing
to think about.

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:17.542
And because of the excitement
around this technology,

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.859
there's a lot of interest
in start-up companies

00:10:20.883 --> 00:10:25.645
that have been founded
to commercialize the CRISPR technology,

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:27.158
and lots of venture capitalists

00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:29.754
that have been investing
in these companies.

00:10:31.242 --> 00:10:32.815
But we have to also consider

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:36.461
that the CRISPR technology can be used
for things like enhancement.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:39.529
Imagine that we could try
to engineer humans

00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:43.988
that have enhanced properties,
such as stronger bones,

00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:48.083
or less susceptibility
to cardiovascular disease

00:10:48.107 --> 00:10:49.618
or even to have properties

00:10:49.642 --> 00:10:52.041
that we would consider maybe
to be desirable,

00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:56.506
like a different eye color
or to be taller, things like that.

00:10:57.942 --> 00:10:59.788
"Designer humans," if you will.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.170
Right now, the genetic information

00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:07.687
to understand what types of genes
would give rise to these traits

00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:09.444
is mostly not known.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.714
But it's important to know

00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:15.023
that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool
to make such changes,

00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:17.554
once that knowledge becomes available.

00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:22.762
This raises a number of ethical questions
that we have to carefully consider,

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:27.001
and this is why I and my colleagues
have called for a global pause

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:31.771
in any clinical application
of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:32.946
to give us time

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.347
to really consider all of the various
implications of doing so.

00:11:37.743 --> 00:11:41.586
And actually, there is an important
precedent for such a pause

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.929
from the 1970s,

00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:44.817
when scientists got together

00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:48.671
to call for a moratorium
on the use of molecular cloning,

00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:54.650
until the safety of that technology
could be tested carefully and validated.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:12:00.646
So, genome-engineered humans
are not with us yet,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.317
but this is no longer science fiction.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:08.544
Genome-engineered animals and plants
are happening right now.

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:13.122
And this puts in front of all of us
a huge responsibility,

00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:17.723
to consider carefully
both the unintended consequences

00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:21.793
as well as the intended impacts
of a scientific breakthrough.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.342
Thank you.

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:27.366
(Applause)

00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:32.735
(Applause ends)

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:37.429
Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is
a technology with huge consequences,

00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:38.604
as you pointed out.

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:43.800
Your attitude about asking for a pause
or a moratorium or a quarantine

00:12:43.824 --> 00:12:45.844
is incredibly responsible.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:49.281
There are, of course,
the therapeutic results of this,

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:51.455
but then there are the un-therapeutic ones

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.659
and they seem to be the ones
gaining traction,

00:12:53.683 --> 00:12:54.929
particularly in the media.

00:12:54.953 --> 00:12:59.119
This is one of the latest issues
of The Economist -- "Editing humanity."

00:12:59.143 --> 00:13:02.962
It's all about genetic enhancement,
it's not about therapeutics.

00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:05.823
What kind of reactions
did you get back in March

00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:07.864
from your colleagues in the science world,

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.246
when you asked or suggested

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.586
that we should actually pause this
for a moment and think about it?

00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:16.055
Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues
were actually, I think, delighted

00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:18.324
to have the opportunity
to discuss this openly.

00:13:18.348 --> 00:13:20.694
It's interesting that as I talk to people,

00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:23.186
my scientific colleagues
as well as others,

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.520
there's a wide variety
of viewpoints about this.

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:29.218
So clearly it's a topic that needs
careful consideration and discussion.

00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:31.457
BG: There's a big meeting
happening in December

00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:33.457
that you and your colleagues are calling,

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:36.248
together with the National Academy
of Sciences and others,

00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:39.564
what do you hope will come
out of the meeting, practically?

00:13:39.588 --> 00:13:41.954
JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views

00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:45.578
of many different individuals
and stakeholders

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:49.894
who want to think about how to use
this technology responsibly.

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:53.020
It may not be possible to come up with
a consensus point of view,

00:13:53.044 --> 00:13:55.037
but I think we should at least understand

00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:57.033
what all the issues are as we go forward.

00:13:57.057 --> 00:13:58.463
BG: Now, colleagues of yours,

00:13:58.487 --> 00:14:00.566
like George Church,
for example, at Harvard,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.026
they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically
are just a question of safety.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.704
We test and test and test again,
in animals and in labs,

00:14:06.728 --> 00:14:10.644
and then once we feel it's safe enough,
we move on to humans."

00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:13.249
So that's kind of the other
school of thought,

00:14:13.273 --> 00:14:16.421
that we should actually use
this opportunity and really go for it.

00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:20.223
Is there a possible split happening
in the science community about this?

00:14:20.247 --> 00:14:22.707
I mean, are we going to see
some people holding back

00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:24.525
because they have ethical concerns,

00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:26.236
and some others just going forward

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.556
because some countries under-regulate
or don't regulate at all?

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.425
JD: Well, I think with any new technology,
especially something like this,

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:36.234
there are going to be
a variety of viewpoints,

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:39.599
and I think that's
perfectly understandable.

00:14:39.623 --> 00:14:41.135
I think that in the end,

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:46.110
this technology will be used
for human genome engineering,

00:14:46.134 --> 00:14:50.451
but I think to do that without careful
consideration and discussion

00:14:50.475 --> 00:14:53.412
of the risks and potential complications

00:14:53.436 --> 00:14:54.975
would not be responsible.

00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:57.978
BG: There are a lot of technologies
and other fields of science

00:14:58.002 --> 00:15:00.773
that are developing exponentially,
pretty much like yours.

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:04.830
I'm thinking about artificial
intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.366
No one seems --

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.898
aside from autonomous warfare robots --

00:15:08.922 --> 00:15:13.627
nobody seems to have launched
a similar discussion in those fields,

00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:15.061
in calling for a moratorium.

00:15:15.085 --> 00:15:19.156
Do you think that your discussion may
serve as a blueprint for other fields?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.699
JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists
to get out of the laboratory.

00:15:22.723 --> 00:15:23.876
Speaking for myself,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.516
it's a little bit
uncomfortable to do that.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.454
But I do think that being involved
in the genesis of this

00:15:30.478 --> 00:15:34.334
really puts me and my colleagues
in a position of responsibility.

00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:37.788
And I would say that I certainly hope
that other technologies

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.458
will be considered in the same way,

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:43.880
just as we would want to consider
something that could have implications

00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:45.831
in other fields besides biology.

00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:47.807
BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.

00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:49.092
JD: Thank you.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:52.809
(Applause)
