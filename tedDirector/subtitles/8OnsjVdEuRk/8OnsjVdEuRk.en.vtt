00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:18.747
We conventionally divide space

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.309
into private and public realms,

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.576
and we know these legal
distinctions very well

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.584
because we've become experts

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:29.444
at protecting our private
property and private space.

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:31.348
But we're less attuned

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:34.903
to the nuances of the public.

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:38.826
What translates generic public
space into qualitative space?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.232
I mean, this is something

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:42.057
that our studio has been working on

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.565
for the past decade.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.828
And we're doing this
through some case studies.

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:47.317
A large chunk of our work

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.857
has been put into transforming

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.653
this neglected industrial ruin

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.726
into a viable post-industrial space

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.227
that looks forward and backward

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:57.488
at the same time.

00:00:57.512 --> 00:00:59.990
And another huge chunk of our work

00:01:00.014 --> 00:01:02.028
has gone into making relevant

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:04.724
a site that's grown
out of sync with its time.

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.768
We've been working
on democratizing Lincoln Center

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.486
for a public that doesn't
usually have $300

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.251
to spend on an opera ticket.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.942
So we've been eating, drinking,

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.236
thinking, living public space

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.207
for quite a long time.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.476
And it's taught us really one thing,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.444
and that is to truly
make good public space,

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:30.694
you have to erase the distinctions

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:33.319
between architecture, urbanism,

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.194
landscape, media design

00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:36.778
and so on.

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.807
It really goes beyond distinction.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.861
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.194
and we're working
on another transformation,

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.819
and that is for the existing
Hirshhorn Museum

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:48.444
that's sited

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:50.736
on the most revered
public space in America,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.669
the National Mall.

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:55.236
The Mall is a symbol

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.069
of American democracy.

00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:01.069
And what's fantastic is that this symbol

00:02:01.093 --> 00:02:03.278
is not a thing, it's not an image,

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:04.986
it's not an artifact,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.694
actually it's a space,

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:09.544
and it's kind of just defined
by a line of buildings

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:11.575
on either side.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.319
It's a space where citizens
can voice their discontent

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.612
and show their power.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.528
It's a place where pivotal
moments in American history

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:21.684
have taken place.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.090
And they're inscribed in there forever --

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:26.469
like the march on Washington
for jobs and freedom

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:29.561
and the great speech that Martin
Luther King gave there.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:33.944
The Vietnam protests,
the commemoration of all that died

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:35.986
in the pandemic of AIDS,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.528
the march for women's reproductive rights,

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:41.986
right up until almost the present.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.148
The Mall is the greatest civic stage

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:48.819
in this country for dissent.

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:52.707
And it's synonymous with free speech,

00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.398
even if you're not sure what it
is that you have to say.

00:02:55.422 --> 00:03:00.428
It may just be a place
for civic commiseration.

00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:04.069
There is a huge disconnect, we believe,

00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:08.236
between the communicative
and discursive space of the Mall

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.278
and the museums that line
it to either side.

00:03:12.302 --> 00:03:15.903
And that is that those
museums are usually passive,

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:19.278
they have passive relationships
between the museum

00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:20.922
as the presenter and the audience,

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.194
as the receiver of information.

00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:24.944
And so you can see dinosaurs

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:29.028
and insects and collections of locomotives

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.353
and all of that,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.884
but you're really not involved;

00:03:31.908 --> 00:03:33.528
you're being talked to.

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:38.231
When Richard Koshalek took
over as director of the Hirshhorn

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.028
in 2009,

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:42.444
he was determined to take advantage

00:03:42.468 --> 00:03:45.694
of the fact that this museum was sited

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.444
at the most unique place:

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.319
at the seat of power in the U.S.

00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:51.528
And while art and politics

00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:56.986
are inherently and implicitly
together always and all the time,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.153
there could be some very
special relationship

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:05.069
that could be forged
here in its uniqueness.

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:07.694
The question is, is it possible ultimately

00:04:07.718 --> 00:04:09.444
for art to insert itself

00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:12.569
into the dialogue of national
and world affairs?

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:16.438
And could the museum be
an agent of cultural diplomacy?

00:04:16.462 --> 00:04:21.499
There are over 180 embassies
in Washington D.C.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:24.486
There are over 500 think tanks.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.986
There should be a way

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.903
of harnessing all of that intellectual
and global energy

00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:31.053
into, and somehow through, the museum.

00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:34.132
There should be some kind of brain trust.

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:37.444
So the Hirshhorn, as we began
to think about it,

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:39.944
and as we evolved the mission,

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:41.778
with Richard and his team --

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.903
it's really his life blood.

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:47.988
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art,

00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:50.778
the Hirshhorn will become a public forum,

00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:52.903
a place of discourse

00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:55.111
for issues around arts,

00:04:55.135 --> 00:05:00.194
culture, politics and policy.

00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:04.194
It would have the global reach
of the World Economic Forum.

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:07.076
It would have the interdisciplinarity
of the TED Conference.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.534
It would have the informality
of the town square.

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:13.463
And for this new initiative,

00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:15.278
the Hirshhorn would have to expand

00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:16.655
or appropriate a site

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.549
for a contemporary, deployable structure.

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:21.288
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn --

00:05:21.312 --> 00:05:24.403
so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut

00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:26.611
designed in the early '70s

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:28.363
by Gordon Bunshaft.

00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:29.653
It's hulking, it's silent,

00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:31.403
it's cloistered, it's arrogant,

00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:33.736
it's a design challenge.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.309
Architects love to hate it.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.319
One redeeming feature

00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:39.028
is it's lifted up off the ground

00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:40.778
and it's got this void,

00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:42.403
and it's got an empty core

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:45.319
kind of in the spirit and that facade

00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:49.069
very much corporate and federal style.

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:50.986
And around that space,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.528
the ring is actually galleries.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.153
Very, very difficult
to mount shows in there.

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.111
When the Hirshhorn opened,

00:05:57.135 --> 00:05:59.421
Ada Louise Huxstable,
the New York Times critic,

00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:00.932
had some choice words:

00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:02.734
"Neo-penitentiary modern."

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.593
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.028
for a maimed collection."

00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:08.784
Almost four decades later,

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:10.528
how will this building expand

00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:12.557
for a new progressive program?

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.069
Where would it go?

00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:15.311
It can't go in the Mall.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:16.568
There is no space there.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.111
It can't go in the courtyard.

00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:23.319
It's already taken up by landscape
and by sculptures.

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:24.724
Well there's always the hole.

00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:29.236
But how could it take
the space of that hole

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.236
and not be buried in it invisibly?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.986
How could it become iconic?

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.534
And what language would it take?

00:06:36.558 --> 00:06:39.736
The Hirshhorn sits
among the Mall's monumental institutions.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.580
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,

00:06:42.604 --> 00:06:45.378
made of stone or concrete.

00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:47.268
And the question is,

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:48.684
if one inhabits that space,

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.046
what is the material of the Mall?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.694
It has to be different
from the buildings there.

00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:56.718
It has to be something entirely different.

00:06:56.742 --> 00:06:58.506
It has to be air.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.028
In our imagination, it has to be light.

00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:03.243
It has to be ephemeral.
It has to be formless.

00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:05.267
And it has to be free.

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:08.801
(Video)

00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:19.754
So this is the big idea.

00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:22.319
It's a giant airbag.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:25.974
The expansion takes
the shape of its container

00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:27.713
and it oozes out wherever it can --

00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:29.736
the top and sides.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.486
But more poetically,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.528
we like to think of the structure

00:07:33.552 --> 00:07:35.600
as inhaling the democratic
air of the Mall,

00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:39.361
bringing it into itself.

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:43.332
The before and the after.

00:07:43.356 --> 00:07:46.486
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.028
That was the lounge.

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.990
It's basically one big volume of air

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.278
that just oozes out in every direction.

00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:56.311
The membrane is translucent.

00:07:56.335 --> 00:08:00.000
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.

00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:04.092
And it's inflated twice a year
for one month at a time.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.277
This is the view from the inside.

00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:09.123
So you might have been wondering

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:11.101
how in the world

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.554
did we get this approved
by the federal government.

00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:17.434
It had to be approved
by actually two agencies.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:21.319
And one is there to preserve

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:23.684
the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:26.417
I blush whenever I show this.

00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:30.236
It is yours to interpret.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.278
But one thing I can say

00:08:32.302 --> 00:08:34.736
is that it's a combination

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.986
of iconoclasm

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.613
and adoration.

00:08:40.637 --> 00:08:43.729
There was also some creative
interpretation involved.

00:08:43.753 --> 00:08:46.653
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910

00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.611
limits the height of buildings in D.C.

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:50.569
to 130 feet,

00:08:50.593 --> 00:08:53.444
except for spires, towers,
domes and minarets.

00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:58.111
This pretty much exempts monuments
of the church and state.

00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:01.236
And the bubble is 153 ft.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.861
That's the Pantheon next to it.

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:07.153
It's about 1.2 million cubic
feet of compressed air.

00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:09.069
And so we argued it

00:09:09.093 --> 00:09:11.069
on the merits of being a dome.

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.153
So there it is,

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:14.327
very stately,

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:17.778
among all the stately
buildings in the Mall.

00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:20.819
And while this Hirshhorn
is not landmarked,

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:23.194
it's very, very historically sensitive.

00:09:23.218 --> 00:09:25.569
And so we couldn't really
touch its surfaces.

00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:27.308
We couldn't leave any traces behind.

00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:29.486
So we strained it from the edges,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.611
and we held it by cables.

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.986
It's a study of some bondage techniques,

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.669
which are actually very important

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:38.594
because it's hit by wind all the time.

00:09:38.618 --> 00:09:40.709
There's one permanent
steel ring at the top,

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:43.424
but it can't be seen
from any vantage point on the Mall.

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:45.611
There are also some restrictions

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.112
about how much it could be lit.

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.153
It glows from within, it's translucent.

00:09:49.177 --> 00:09:52.319
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol

00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:53.736
or some of the monuments.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.116
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.236
So it comes to the site twice a year.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.194
It's taken off the delivery truck.

00:10:01.218 --> 00:10:02.694
It's hoisted.

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.986
And then it's inflated

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.736
with this low-pressure air.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.713
And then it's restrained with the cables.

00:10:08.737 --> 00:10:11.903
And then it's ballasted
with water at the very bottom.

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:16.028
This is a very strange moment

00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:18.444
where we were asked
by the bureaucracy at the Mall

00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:21.653
how much time would it take to install.

00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:24.392
And we said, well the first
erection would take one week.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.736
And they really connected with that idea.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.736
And then it was really
easy all the way through.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.819
So we didn't really have
that many hurdles, I have to say,

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.891
with the government
and all the authorities.

00:10:37.915 --> 00:10:39.439
But some of the toughest hurdles

00:10:39.463 --> 00:10:40.944
have been the technical ones.

00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.236
This is the warp and weft.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.278
This is a point cloud.

00:10:44.302 --> 00:10:46.403
There are extreme pressures.

00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:48.189
This is a very, very unusual building

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.111
in that there's no gravity load,

00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:51.850
but there's load in every direction.

00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:56.403
And I'm just going to zip
through these slides.

00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:59.528
And this is the space in action.

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:02.361
So flexible interior for discussions,

00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.694
just like this, but in the round --

00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:06.153
luminous and reconfigurable.

00:11:06.177 --> 00:11:08.569
Could be used for anything,

00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:10.319
for performances, films,

00:11:10.343 --> 00:11:12.861
for installations.

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:15.278
And the very first program

00:11:15.302 --> 00:11:17.493
will be one of cultural
dialogue and diplomacy

00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:18.778
organized in partnership

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:21.403
with the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:23.153
Form and content are together here.

00:11:23.177 --> 00:11:25.819
The bubble is an anti-monument.

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:28.361
The ideals of participatory democracy

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:30.486
are represented through suppleness

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.932
rather than rigidity.

00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:33.361
Art and politics

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:37.001
occupy an ambiguous site
outside the museum walls,

00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:40.594
but inside of the museum's core,

00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:42.444
blending its air

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.811
with the democratic air of the Mall.

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:50.361
And the bubble will inflate

00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:51.986
hopefully for the first time

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.194
at the end of 2013.

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:56.694
Thank you.

00:11:56.718 --> 00:11:59.718
(Applause)
