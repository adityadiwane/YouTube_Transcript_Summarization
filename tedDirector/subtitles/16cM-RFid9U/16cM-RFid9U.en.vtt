00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:14.337
I want to tell you the story

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:18.119
about the time I almost got kidnapped

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:21.119
in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:25.105
It's the day after graduating
from design school

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:26.614
and I'm having a yard sale.

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:29.331
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:31.468
and he starts looking through my stuff.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.918
And he buys a piece of art that I made.

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.085
And it turns out he's alone
in town for the night,

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.662
driving cross-country on a road trip

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.469
before he goes into the Peace Corps.

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:44.496
So I invite him out for a beer

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.623
and he tells me all about his passion

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.695
for making a difference in the world.

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:52.086
Now it's starting to get late,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.067
and I'm getting pretty tired.

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:56.404
As I motion for the tab,

00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:58.575
I make the mistake of asking him,

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.281
"So where are you staying tonight?"

00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:04.114
And he makes it worse by saying,

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:06.718
"Actually, I don't have a place."

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:09.982
And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:12.212
What do you do?

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.284
We've all been there, right?

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:16.848
Do I offer to host this guy?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.483
But, I just met him -- I mean,

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.333
he says he's going to the Peace Corps,

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.992
but I don't really know if he's going
to the Peace Corps

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.896
and I don't want to end up kidnapped
in the trunk of a Miata.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.094
That's a small trunk!

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:32.155
So then I hear myself saying,

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.203
"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on
in my living room."

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.547
And the voice in my head goes,

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:38.889
"Wait, what?"

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.515
That night, I'm laying in bed,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.746
I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.477
"Oh my god, what have I done?

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.656
There's a complete stranger
sleeping in my living room.

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:54.315
What if he's psychotic?"

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.329
My anxiety grows so much,

00:01:56.353 --> 00:01:58.213
I leap out of bed,

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:00.930
I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.779
and I lock the bedroom door.

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:06.168
It turns out he was not psychotic.

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:08.423
We've kept in touch ever since.

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:10.737
And the piece of art
he bought at the yard sale

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.250
is hanging in his classroom;
he's a teacher now.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:16.812
This was my first hosting experience,

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.720
and it completely changed my perspective.

00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:25.960
Maybe the people that my childhood
taught me to label as strangers

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:28.440
were actually friends waiting
to be discovered.

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:33.487
The idea of hosting people on airbeds
gradually became natural to me

00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.170
and when I moved to San Francisco,

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:36.789
I brought the airbed with me.

00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:38.742
So now it's two years later.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:42.051
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.349
my roommate moves out,
and then the rent goes up.

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:49.051
And then I learn there's a design
conference coming to town,

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.866
and all the hotels are sold out.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.370
And I've always believed
that turning fear into fun

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:55.902
is the gift of creativity.

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:02.060
So here's what I pitch my best friend
and my new roommate Brian Chesky:

00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:04.384
"Brian, thought of a way
to make a few bucks --

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:06.891
turning our place into 'designers
bed and breakfast,'

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.694
offering young designers who come
to town a place to crash,

00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:12.165
complete with wireless Internet,
a small desk space,

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.205
sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.400
Ha!"

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:20.074
We built a basic website
and Airbed and Breakfast was born.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.945
Three lucky guests got to stay

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.540
on a 20-dollar airbed
on the hardwood floor.

00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:28.524
But they loved it, and so did we.

00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:31.406
I swear, the ham
and Swiss cheese omelets we made

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.437
tasted totally different
because we made them for our guests.

00:03:35.618 --> 00:03:37.800
We took them on adventures
around the city,

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.436
and when we said goodbye
to the last guest,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.943
the door latch clicked,

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:44.927
Brian and I just stared at each other.

00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:49.270
Did we just discover
it was possible to make friends

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:50.872
while also making rent?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.999
The wheels had started to turn.

00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:55.674
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:58.015
joined as engineering co-founder.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.619
And we buckled down to see

00:04:00.643 --> 00:04:02.546
if we could turn this into a business.

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:05.686
Here's what we pitched investors:

00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:09.814
"We want to build a website

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:13.380
where people publicly post pictures
of their most intimate spaces,

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:15.261
their bedrooms, the bathrooms --

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.711
the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed
when people come over.

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:20.406
And then, over the Internet,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.863
they're going to invite complete strangers
to come sleep in their homes.

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:25.292
It's going to be huge!"

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:27.482
(Laughter)

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.763
We sat back, and we waited
for the rocket ship to blast off.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.098
It did not.

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:37.506
No one in their right minds
would invest in a service

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.102
that allows strangers
to sleep in people's homes.

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:41.278
Why?

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.220
Because we've all been taught
as kids, strangers equal danger.

00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:49.585
Now, when you're faced with a problem,
you fall back on what you know,

00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:51.379
and all we really knew was design.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.212
In art school, you learn
that design is much more

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:58.449
than the look and feel of something --
it's the whole experience.

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:00.532
We learned to do that for objects,

00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:04.840
but here, we were aiming
to build Olympic trust

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:06.674
between people who had never met.

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:10.242
Could design make that happen?

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.697
Is it possible to design for trust?

00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:18.802
I want to give you a sense
of the flavor of trust

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:20.682
that we were aiming to achieve.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.122
I've got a 30-second experiment

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:25.594
that will push you past your comfort zone.

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:27.879
If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.654
OK, I need you to take out your phones.

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:40.366
Now that you have your phone out,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.119
I'd like you to unlock your phone.

00:05:45.807 --> 00:05:49.624
Now hand your unlocked phone
to the person on your left.

00:05:49.648 --> 00:05:53.353
(Laughter)

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:04.547
That tiny sense of panic
you're feeling right now --

00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:06.246
(Laughter)

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.600
is exactly how hosts feel the first time
they open their home.

00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.338
Because the only thing
more personal than your phone

00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:14.561
is your home.

00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.890
People don't just see your messages,

00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:18.173
they see your bedroom,

00:06:18.197 --> 00:06:19.787
your kitchen, your toilet.

00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:25.481
Now, how does it feel holding
someone's unlocked phone?

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.933
Most of us feel really responsible.

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:32.818
That's how most guests feel
when they stay in a home.

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:35.785
And it's because of this
that our company can even exist.

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:39.094
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?

00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:42.576
(Laughter)

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.197
Would you tell Twitter
he's running for President?

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.222
(Laughter)

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:49.784
(Applause)

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.977
OK, you can hand your phones back now.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.840
So now that you've experienced
the kind of trust challenge

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:08.104
we were facing,

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:11.257
I'd love to share a few discoveries
we've made along the way.

00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:14.270
What if we changed one small thing

00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:16.338
about the design of that experiment?

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:20.145
What if your neighbor had introduced
themselves first, with their name,

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.034
where they're from, the name
of their kids or their dog?

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:27.217
Imagine that they had 150 reviews
of people saying,

00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:29.646
"They're great at holding
unlocked phones!"

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.527
(Laughter)

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:37.906
Now how would you feel
about handing your phone over?

00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:40.936
It turns out,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.412
a well-designed reputation system
is key for building trust.

00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:47.961
And we didn't actually
get it right the first time.

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:50.730
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:55.833
Eventually, we learned to wait
until both guests and hosts

00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:57.961
left the review before we reveal them.

00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:02.199
Now, here's a discovery
we made just last week.

00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:04.888
We did a joint study with Stanford,

00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:07.906
where we looked at people's
willingness to trust someone

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.396
based on how similar they are in age,
location and geography.

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:16.427
The research showed, not surprisingly,

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:18.395
we prefer people who are like us.

00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:22.929
The more different somebody is,

00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:24.280
the less we trust them.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.153
Now, that's a natural social bias.

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.886
But what's interesting is what happens

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.868
when you add reputation into the mix,

00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:34.732
in this case, with reviews.

00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:37.415
Now, if you've got
less than three reviews,

00:08:37.439 --> 00:08:38.819
nothing changes.

00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:41.646
But if you've got more than 10,

00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:44.443
everything changes.

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:48.695
High reputation beats high similarity.

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:53.029
The right design can actually
help us overcome

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.235
one of our most deeply rooted biases.

00:08:57.247 --> 00:09:00.355
Now we also learned that building
the right amount of trust

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:02.632
takes the right amount of disclosure.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:06.537
This is what happens when a guest
first messages a host.

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:11.752
If you share too little, like, "Yo,"

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.483
acceptance rates go down.

00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:16.624
And if you share too much, like,

00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:18.341
"I'm having issues with my mother,"

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:19.515
(Laughter)

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:21.531
acceptance rates also go down.

00:09:22.372 --> 00:09:24.317
But there's a zone that's just right,

00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:28.639
like, "Love the artwork in your place.
Coming for vacation with my family."

00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:31.972
So how do we design for just
the right amount of disclosure?

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.115
We use the size of the box
to suggest the right length,

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:39.377
and we guide them with prompts
to encourage sharing.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.256
We bet our whole company

00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:45.789
on the hope that,

00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:47.696
with the right design,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.989
people would be willing to overcome
the stranger-danger bias.

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:53.300
What we didn't realize

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:55.758
is just how many people

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:58.157
were ready and waiting
to put the bias aside.

00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:02.574
This is a graph that shows
our rate of adoption.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.455
There's three things happening here.

00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:09.796
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.

00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:12.961
The second is the efforts of our team.

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.582
And third is the existence
of a previously unsatisfied need.

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:21.476
Now, things have been going pretty well.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.292
Obviously, there are times
when things don't work out.

00:10:25.647 --> 00:10:27.611
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:28.904
and trashed homes.

00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:32.784
Hosts have left guests
stranded in the rain.

00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.625
In the early days, I was customer service,

00:10:38.213 --> 00:10:40.506
and those calls came
right to my cell phone.

00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:44.392
I was at the front lines
of trust breaking.

00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:48.044
And there's nothing worse
than those calls,

00:10:48.068 --> 00:10:50.297
it hurts to even think about them.

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:53.806
And the disappointment
in the sound of someone's voice

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.569
was and, I would say, still is

00:10:56.593 --> 00:10:59.033
our single greatest motivator
to keep improving.

00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:05.185
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights
we've ever hosted,

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:09.272
less than a fraction of a percent
have been problematic.

00:11:10.447 --> 00:11:12.776
Turns out, people
are justified in their trust.

00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:15.927
And when trust works out right,

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:18.251
it can be absolutely magical.

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:22.087
We had a guest stay
with a host in Uruguay,

00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:23.719
and he suffered a heart attack.

00:11:24.274 --> 00:11:26.267
The host rushed him to the hospital.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.288
They donated their own blood
for his operation.

00:11:31.342 --> 00:11:33.892
Let me read you his review.

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:36.252
(Laughter)

00:11:41.053 --> 00:11:43.332
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:45.599
prone to myocardial infarctions.

00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:47.868
(Laughter)

00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:52.504
The area is beautiful and has
direct access to the best hospitals.

00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:54.012
(Laughter)

00:11:54.036 --> 00:11:57.565
Javier and Alejandra instantly
become guardian angels

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:00.295
who will save your life
without even knowing you.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.082
They will rush you to the hospital
in their own car while you're dying

00:12:05.106 --> 00:12:08.413
and stay in the waiting room
while the doctors give you a bypass.

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:12.554
They don't want you to feel lonely,
they bring you books to read.

00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:16.605
And they let you stay at their house
extra nights without charging you.

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:17.859
Highly recommended!"

00:12:17.883 --> 00:12:20.336
(Applause)

00:12:26.342 --> 00:12:28.591
Of course, not every stay is like that.

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:31.787
But this connection beyond the transaction

00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.572
is exactly what the sharing
economy is aiming for.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.809
Now, when I heard that term,

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.759
I have to admit, it tripped me up.

00:12:40.783 --> 00:12:43.306
How do sharing
and transactions go together?

00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:46.960
So let's be clear; it is about commerce.

00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:50.156
But if you just called it
the rental economy,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.777
it would be incomplete.

00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:56.905
The sharing economy is commerce
with the promise of human connection.

00:12:57.612 --> 00:12:59.473
People share a part of themselves,

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.158
and that changes everything.

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:05.853
You know how most travel today is, like,

00:13:05.877 --> 00:13:07.608
I think of it like fast food --

00:13:07.632 --> 00:13:09.643
it's efficient and consistent,

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:13.623
at the cost of local and authentic.

00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:17.740
What if travel were like
a magnificent buffet

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.413
of local experiences?

00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:21.733
What if anywhere you visited,

00:13:22.392 --> 00:13:24.637
there was a central marketplace of locals

00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:27.303
offering to get you thoroughly drunk

00:13:27.327 --> 00:13:31.252
on a pub crawl in neighborhoods
you didn't even know existed.

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:36.003
Or learning to cook from the chef
of a five-star restaurant?

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:41.746
Today, homes are designed around
the idea of privacy and separation.

00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:45.703
What if homes were designed
to be shared from the ground up?

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.787
What would that look like?

00:13:49.673 --> 00:13:52.401
What if cities embraced
a culture of sharing?

00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:58.510
I see a future of shared cities
that bring us community and connection

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:00.745
instead of isolation and separation.

00:14:01.878 --> 00:14:03.859
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:05.566
they've actually even started this.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.466
They've repurposed hundreds
of government parking spots

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.934
to be shared by residents.

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:13.463
They're connecting students
who need a place to live

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:15.855
with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:20.582
And they've started an incubator
to help fund the next generation

00:14:20.606 --> 00:14:22.297
of sharing economy start-ups.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.176
Tonight, just on our service,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.544
785,000 people

00:14:33.803 --> 00:14:36.583
in 191 countries

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:41.257
will either stay in a stranger's home

00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:44.228
or welcome one into theirs.

00:14:46.014 --> 00:14:48.913
Clearly, it's not as crazy
as we were taught.

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:52.783
We didn't invent anything new.

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:55.853
Hospitality has been around forever.

00:14:58.568 --> 00:15:01.698
There's been many other
websites like ours.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.327
So, why did ours eventually take off?

00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:10.319
Luck and timing aside,

00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:13.933
I've learned that you can take
the components of trust,

00:15:13.957 --> 00:15:15.522
and you can design for that.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.371
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:23.974
stranger-danger bias.

00:15:23.998 --> 00:15:25.759
And that's amazing to me.

00:15:26.304 --> 00:15:27.805
It blows my mind.

00:15:29.184 --> 00:15:31.762
I think about this every time
I see a red Miata go by.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.688
Now, we know design won't solve
all the world's problems.

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.294
But if it can help out with this one,

00:15:42.318 --> 00:15:43.907
if it can make a dent in this,

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:49.745
it makes me wonder,
what else can we design for next?

00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.492
Thank you.

00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:59.142
(Applause)
