00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.448
Today I'm going to speak to you

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:18.502
about the last 30 years
of architectural history.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.143
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:23.854
It's a complex topic,

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:28.252
so we're just going to dive right in
at a complex place:

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:29.482
New Jersey.

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:32.696
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.562
and I was six, and I lived there
in my parents' house

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:38.210
in a town called Livingston,

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:41.165
and this was my childhood bedroom.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:44.124
Around the corner from my bedroom

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:47.010
was the bathroom
that I used to share with my sister.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.138
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:52.963
was a balcony that overlooked
the family room.

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:57.095
And that's where everyone
would hang out and watch TV,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.282
so that every time that I walked
from my bedroom to the bathroom,

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:02.642
everyone would see me,

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.420
and every time I took a shower
and would come back in a towel,

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:07.821
everyone would see me.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:09.543
And I looked like this.

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.741
I was awkward,

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:15.856
insecure, and I hated it.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.919
I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:21.967
I hated that room, and I hated that house.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:24.457
And that's architecture.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.234
(Laughter)

00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:27.576
Done.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.462
That feeling, those emotions that I felt,

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:34.179
that's the power of architecture,

00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:37.741
because architecture is not about math
and it's not about zoning,

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.123
it's about those visceral,
emotional connections

00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:43.903
that we feel to the places that we occupy.

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:47.529
And it's no surprise
that we feel that way,

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:49.761
because according to the EPA,

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:54.404
Americans spend 90 percent
of their time indoors.

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:59.164
That's 90 percent of our time
surrounded by architecture.

00:01:59.188 --> 00:02:00.696
That's huge.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.213
That means that architecture is shaping us
in ways that we didn't even realize.

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:11.296
That makes us a little bit gullible
and very, very predictable.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.093
It means that when I show you
a building like this,

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:15.499
I know what you think:

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:18.870
You think "power"
and "stability" and "democracy."

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.872
And I know you think that
because it's based on a building

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.690
that was build 2,500 years ago
by the Greeks.

00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:27.594
This is a trick.

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:30.080
This is a trigger that architects use

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:33.993
to get you to create
an emotional connection

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:36.658
to the forms that we build
our buildings out of.

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:39.877
It's a predictable emotional connection,

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:43.121
and we've been using this trick
for a long, long time.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.902
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:50.083
We used it in the 19th century
to build art museums.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:52.312
And in the 20th century in America,

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:54.171
we used it to build houses.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.933
And look at these solid,
stable little soldiers

00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:59.528
facing the ocean
and keeping away the elements.

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:02.900
This is really, really useful,

00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.911
because building things is terrifying.

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:10.467
It's expensive, it takes a long time,
and it's very complicated.

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:13.154
And the people that build things --

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:15.383
developers and governments --

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:18.260
they're naturally afraid of innovation,

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:22.264
and they'd rather just use those forms
that they know you'll respond to.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.314
That's how we end up
with buildings like this.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:27.766
This is a nice building.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.081
This is the Livingston Public Library

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.215
that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.864
and, you know, it's got a dome

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:38.495
and it's got this round thing 
and columns, red brick,

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:43.485
and you can kind of guess what Livingston
is trying to say with this building:

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.035
children, property values and history.

00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:51.286
But it doesn't have much to do
with what a library actually does today.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.273
That same year, in 2004,
on the other side of the country,

00:03:56.297 --> 00:03:58.292
another library was completed,

00:03:58.316 --> 00:03:59.789
and it looks like this.

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:01.331
It's in Seattle.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.694
This library is about how
we consume media in a digital age.

00:04:07.718 --> 00:04:11.288
It's about a new kind
of public amenity for the city,

00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:13.917
a place to gather and read and share.

00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:16.867
So how is it possible

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:20.304
that in the same year,
in the same country,

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:22.951
two buildings, both called libraries,

00:04:22.975 --> 00:04:24.607
look so completely different?

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:31.109
And the answer is that architecture works
on the principle of a pendulum.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.369
On the one side is innovation,

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:38.010
and architects are constantly pushing,
pushing for new technologies,

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:41.716
new typologies, new solutions
for the way that we live today.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:44.280
And we push and we push and we push

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:46.903
until we completely alienate all of you.

00:04:46.927 --> 00:04:49.153
We wear all black, we get very depressed,

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:51.338
you think we're adorable,

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:54.821
we're dead inside because
we've got no choice.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:56.597
We have to go to the other side

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.736
and reengage those symbols
that we know you love.

00:05:00.394 --> 00:05:02.553
So we do that, and you're happy,

00:05:02.577 --> 00:05:04.387
we feel like sellouts,

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:06.061
so we start experimenting again

00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:09.279
and we push the pendulum back
and back and forth and back and forth

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:11.678
we've gone for the last 300 years,

00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:13.815
and certainly for the last 30 years.

00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:18.518
Okay, 30 years ago
we were coming out of the '70s.

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:22.201
Architects had been busy experimenting
with something called brutalism.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.765
It's about concrete.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.261
(Laughter)

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:26.429
You can guess this.

00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.783
Small windows, dehumanizing scale.

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:32.570
This is really tough stuff.

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:35.357
So as we get closer to the '80s,

00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:37.724
we start to reengage those symbols.

00:05:37.748 --> 00:05:40.696
We push the pendulum
back into the other direction.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.529
We take these forms that we know you love

00:05:43.553 --> 00:05:45.118
and we update them.

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.151
We add neon

00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:49.439
and we add pastels

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:51.117
and we use new materials.

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:52.579
And you love it.

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.552
And we can't give you enough of it.

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:56.740
We take Chippendale armoires

00:05:56.764 --> 00:05:59.136
and we turned those into skyscrapers,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.866
and skyscrapers can be
medieval castles made out of glass.

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:05.961
Forms got big,

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:08.512
forms got bold and colorful.

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:11.380
Dwarves became columns.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.443
(Laughter)

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:14.573
Swans grew to the size of buildings.

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:15.934
It was crazy.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.513
But it's the '80s, it's cool.

00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.715
(Laughter)

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:23.733
We're all hanging out in malls

00:06:23.757 --> 00:06:26.138
and we're all moving to the suburbs,

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:28.736
and out there, out in the suburbs,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.092
we can create our own
architectural fantasies.

00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:33.870
And those fantasies,

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.957
they can be Mediterranean

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:37.906
or French

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.130
or Italian.

00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:40.797
(Laughter)

00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:42.714
Possibly with endless breadsticks.

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:44.764
This is the thing about postmodernism.

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:46.602
This is the thing about symbols.

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:49.888
They're easy, they're cheap,

00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:52.417
because instead of making places,

00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:54.493
we're making memories of places.

00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:57.947
Because I know, 
and I know all of you know,

00:06:57.971 --> 00:06:59.286
this isn't Tuscany.

00:07:00.182 --> 00:07:01.327
This is Ohio.

00:07:01.452 --> 00:07:02.970
(Laughter)

00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:04.819
So architects get frustrated,

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:08.174
and we start pushing the pendulum
back into the other direction.

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:10.786
In the late '80s and early '90s,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.058
we start experimenting with something
called deconstructivism.

00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:17.473
We throw out historical symbols,

00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:21.343
we rely on new, computer-aided
design techniques,

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.324
and we come up with new compositions,

00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:26.204
forms crashing into forms.

00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:29.251
This is academic and heady stuff,

00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:31.126
it's super unpopular,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.813
we totally alienate you.

00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:37.024
Ordinarily, the pendulum would just
swing back into the other direction.

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:39.380
And then, something amazing happened.

00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:43.222
In 1997, this building opened.

00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:46.653
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao,
by Frank Gehry.

00:07:48.228 --> 00:07:49.632
And this building

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:53.920
fundamentally changes
the world's relationship to architecture.

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:58.594
Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao
was one of those rare moments

00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:01.921
when critics, academics,
and the general public

00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:04.711
were completely united around a building.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.462
The New York Times
called this building a miracle.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.842
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent

00:08:14.866 --> 00:08:16.535
after this building was completed.

00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:20.334
So all of a sudden, everybody
wants one of these buildings:

00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:22.383
L.A.,

00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.172
Seattle,

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:26.800
Chicago,

00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:28.528
New York,

00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:30.446
Cleveland,

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.713
Springfield.

00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:32.771
(Laughter)

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:36.018
Everybody wants one,
and Gehry is everywhere.

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:39.382
He is our very first starchitect.

00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:44.865
Now, how is it possible
that these forms --

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:46.794
they're wild and radical --

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.657
how is it possible that they become
so ubiquitous throughout the world?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.766
And it happened because media
so successfully galvanized around them

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:02.587
that they quickly taught us
that these forms mean culture and tourism.

00:09:03.068 --> 00:09:06.466
We created an emotional
reaction to these forms.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.862
So did every mayor in the world.

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:11.469
So every mayor knew
that if they had these forms,

00:09:11.493 --> 00:09:14.483
they had culture and tourism.

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:18.110
This phenomenon
at the turn of the new millennium

00:09:18.134 --> 00:09:20.264
happened to a few other starchitects.

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.671
It happened to Zaha

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:25.094
and it happened to Libeskind,

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:29.732
and what happened
to these elite few architects

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:31.512
at the turn of the new millennium

00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:35.213
could actually start to happen
to the entire field of architecture,

00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:38.475
as digital media starts
to increase the speed

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:40.314
with which we consume information.

00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:44.044
Because think about
how you consume architecture.

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:45.644
A thousand years ago,

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:49.488
you would have had to have walked to
the village next door to see a building.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.118
Transportation speeds up:

00:09:51.142 --> 00:09:54.142
You can take a boat, you can take a plane,
you can be a tourist.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:57.063
Technology speeds up:
You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,

00:09:57.087 --> 00:10:01.950
until finally, we are all
architectural photographers,

00:10:01.974 --> 00:10:05.874
and the building has become
disembodied from the site.

00:10:06.768 --> 00:10:10.315
Architecture is everywhere now,

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:13.453
and that means that
the speed of communication

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:16.570
has finally caught up
to the speed of architecture.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.879
Because architecture
actually moves quite quickly.

00:10:19.903 --> 00:10:22.611
It doesn't take long
to think about a building.

00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:24.788
It takes a long time to build a building,

00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:27.106
three or four years,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.798
and in the interim, an architect
will design two or eight

00:10:30.822 --> 00:10:33.468
or a hundred other buildings

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:37.183
before they know if that building
that they designed four years ago

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.085
was a success or not.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.239
That's because there's never been
a good feedback loop in architecture.

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:47.308
That's how we end up
with buildings like this.

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:50.272
Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:52.167
it was a 20-year movement.

00:10:52.383 --> 00:10:56.201
For 20 years, we were producing
buildings like this

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:59.093
because we had no idea
how much you hated it.

00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:03.084
It's never going to happen again,

00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:05.238
I think,

00:11:05.262 --> 00:11:11.362
because we are living on the verge
of the greatest revolution in architecture

00:11:11.386 --> 00:11:13.755
since the invention of concrete,

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:16.233
of steel, or of the elevator,

00:11:16.257 --> 00:11:17.939
and it's a media revolution.

00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:23.732
So my theory is that when
you apply media to this pendulum,

00:11:23.756 --> 00:11:26.617
it starts swinging faster and faster,

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.379
until it's at both extremes
nearly simultaneously,

00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:35.371
and that effectively blurs the difference
between innovation and symbol,

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:38.770
between us, the architects,
and you, the public.

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:45.402
Now we can make nearly instantaneous,
emotionally charged symbols

00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:47.115
out of something that's brand new.

00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:50.186
Let me show you how this plays out

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.376
in a project that my firm
recently completed.

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:56.304
We were hired to replace this building,
which burned down.

00:11:56.304 --> 00:11:58.773
This is the center of a town
called the Pines

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.543
in Fire Island in New York State.

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:01.980
It's a vacation community.

00:12:02.729 --> 00:12:06.482
We proposed a building that was audacious,

00:12:06.506 --> 00:12:10.157
that was different than any of the forms
that the community was used to,

00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:14.702
and we were scared
and our client was scared

00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:16.489
and the community was scared,

00:12:16.513 --> 00:12:20.669
so we created a series
of photorealistic renderings

00:12:20.693 --> 00:12:22.071
that we put onto Facebook

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.221
and we put onto Instagram,

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:26.566
and we let people start
to do what they do:

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.291
share it, comment, like it, hate it.

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:34.562
But that meant that two years
before the building was complete,

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:37.914
it was already a part of the community,

00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:44.204
so that when the renderings
looked exactly like the finished product,

00:12:44.228 --> 00:12:46.188
there were no surprises.

00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:50.100
This building was already a part
of this community,

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:52.409
and then that first summer,

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:56.351
when people started arriving
and sharing the building on social media,

00:12:56.375 --> 00:13:01.862
the building ceased to be just an edifice
and it became media,

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:05.669
because these, these are not
just pictures of a building,

00:13:05.693 --> 00:13:08.080
they're your pictures of a building.

00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:11.814
And as you use them to tell your story,

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:14.546
they become part
of your personal narrative,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.118
and what you're doing
is you're short-circuiting

00:13:18.142 --> 00:13:20.392
all of our collective memory,

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:24.271
and you're making these charged symbols
for us to understand.

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:27.476
That means we don't need
the Greeks anymore

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.118
to tell us what to think
about architecture.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:34.167
We can tell each other
what we think about architecture,

00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:39.962
because digital media hasn't just changed
the relationship between all of us,

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:43.515
it's changed the relationship
between us and buildings.

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:47.732
Think for a second about
those librarians back in Livingston.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.805
If that building was going
to be built today,

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:55.473
the first thing they would do is go online
and search "new libraries."

00:13:55.705 --> 00:14:00.975
They would be bombarded by examples
of experimentation, of innovation,

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:04.187
of pushing at the envelope
of what a library can be.

00:14:04.998 --> 00:14:06.341
That's ammunition.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.181
That's ammunition
that they can take with them

00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:12.330
to the mayor of Livingston,
to the people of Livingston,

00:14:12.354 --> 00:14:16.313
and say, there's no one answer
to what a library is today.

00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:17.822
Let's be a part of this.

00:14:18.287 --> 00:14:21.153
This abundance of experimentation

00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:24.236
gives them the freedom
to run their own experiment.

00:14:26.452 --> 00:14:28.664
Everything is different now.

00:14:28.664 --> 00:14:32.019
Architects are no longer
these mysterious creatures

00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:34.538
that use big words
and complicated drawings,

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.522
and you aren't the hapless public,

00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:41.081
the consumer that won't accept
anything that they haven't seen anymore.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.713
Architects can hear you,

00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:46.841
and you're not intimidated
by architecture.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.152
That means that that pendulum
swinging back and forth

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:54.154
from style to style,
from movement to movement,

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:55.459
is irrelevant.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.280
We can actually move forward

00:14:58.304 --> 00:15:02.670
and find relevant solutions
to the problems that our society faces.

00:15:03.757 --> 00:15:07.199
This is the end of architectural history,

00:15:07.223 --> 00:15:10.091
and it means that
the buildings of tomorrow

00:15:10.115 --> 00:15:13.278
are going to look a lot different
than the buildings of today.

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:18.797
It means that a public space
in the ancient city of Seville

00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:23.005
can be unique and tailored
to the way that a modern city works.

00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:28.411
It means that a stadium in Brooklyn
can be a stadium in Brooklyn,

00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:31.197
not some red-brick historical pastiche

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:33.701
of what we think a stadium ought to be.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.373
It means that robots are going
to build our buildings,

00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:41.014
because we're finally ready for the forms
that they're going to produce.

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:45.693
And it means that buildings
will twist to the whims of nature

00:15:45.717 --> 00:15:47.520
instead of the other way around.

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:52.280
It means that a parking garage
in Miami Beach, Florida,

00:15:52.304 --> 00:15:54.788
can also be a place for sports

00:15:54.812 --> 00:15:56.191
and for yoga

00:15:56.215 --> 00:15:58.794
and you can even
get married there late at night.

00:15:58.818 --> 00:15:59.842
(Laughter)

00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:04.029
It means that three architects
can dream about swimming

00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:05.973
in the East River of New York,

00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:08.487
and then raise nearly
half a million dollars

00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.839
from a community
that gathered around their cause,

00:16:11.863 --> 00:16:13.593
no one client anymore.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:17.666
It means that no building
is too small for innovation,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.888
like this little reindeer pavilion

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:25.003
that's as muscly and sinewy
as the animals it's designed to observe.

00:16:25.808 --> 00:16:28.546
And it means that a building
doesn't have to be beautiful

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.863
to be lovable,

00:16:29.887 --> 00:16:32.902
like this ugly little building in Spain,

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:35.407
where the architects dug a hole,

00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:36.813
packed it with hay,

00:16:36.837 --> 00:16:39.170
and then poured concrete around it,

00:16:39.194 --> 00:16:40.834
and when the concrete dried,

00:16:40.858 --> 00:16:44.418
they invited someone to come
and clean that hay out

00:16:44.442 --> 00:16:47.373
so that all that's left when it's done

00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:50.072
is this hideous little room

00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:56.050
that's filled with the imprints
and scratches of how that place was made,

00:16:56.074 --> 00:17:00.558
and that becomes the most sublime place
to watch a Spanish sunset.

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:05.013
Because it doesn't matter
if a cow builds our buildings

00:17:05.037 --> 00:17:06.847
or a robot builds our buildings.

00:17:06.871 --> 00:17:10.219
It doesn't matter how we build,
it matters what we build.

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:14.324
Architects already know how
to make buildings that are greener

00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:16.506
and smarter and friendlier.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.104
We've just been waiting
for all of you to want them.

00:17:20.022 --> 00:17:23.350
And finally, we're not
on opposite sides anymore.

00:17:23.957 --> 00:17:26.929
Find an architect, hire an architect,

00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:32.770
work with us to design better buildings,
better cities, and a better world,

00:17:32.794 --> 00:17:35.034
because the stakes are high.

00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:40.825
Buildings don't just reflect our society,
they shape our society

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:42.901
down to the smallest spaces:

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:44.929
the local libraries,

00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:47.382
the homes where we raise our children,

00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:50.599
and the walk that they take
from the bedroom to the bathroom.

00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:52.388
Thank you.

00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:55.412
(Applause)
