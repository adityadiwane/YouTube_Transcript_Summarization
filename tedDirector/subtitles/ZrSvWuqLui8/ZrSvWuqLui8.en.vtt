00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
This is about a place in London

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
called Kiteflyer's Hill

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
where I used to go and spend hours

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
who I've got over.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
actually, for me.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
Thank you very much.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
♫ up to Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
♫ Some nights I think of you ♫

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
♫ and then I go up ♫

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.160
♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.160
♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.160
♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.160
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.160
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160
♫ We won't say a word ♫

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
♫ We won't need them ♫

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160
♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.160
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:38.160
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:55.160
♫ [French] ♫

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:22.160
♫ Where are you? Where are you now? ♫

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.160
♫ Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
(Applause)

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Gracias. Thank you very much.
