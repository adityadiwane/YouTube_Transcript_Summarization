00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:17.439
In the early days of Twitter,
it was like a place of radical de-shaming.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:20.411
People would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:24.929
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:27.755
Voiceless people realized
that they had a voice,

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.734
and it was powerful and eloquent.

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:35.527
If a newspaper ran some racist
or homophobic column,

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.942
we realized we could do
something about it.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.335
We could get them.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.811
We could hit them with a weapon
that we understood but they didn't --

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.010
a social media shaming.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.496
Advertisers would withdraw
their advertising.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.943
When powerful people
misused their privilege,

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.630
we were going to get them.

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:57.092
This was like the
democratization of justice.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:59.519
Hierarchies were being leveled out.

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:01.541
We were going to do things better.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:06.964
Soon after that, a disgraced
pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --

00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:10.123
he'd been caught plagiarizing
and faking quotes,

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:13.879
and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:15.394
And he had the opportunity

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:19.248
to publicly apologize
at a foundation lunch.

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:22.203
This was going to be the most
important speech of his life.

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.511
Maybe it would win him some salvation.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:26.443
He knew before he arrived

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.546
that the foundation was going to be
live-streaming his event,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.594
but what he didn't know
until he turned up,

00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:36.546
was that they'd erected a giant screen
Twitter feed right next to his head.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.062
(Laughter)

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.629
Another one in a monitor screen
in his eye line.

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:44.089
I don't think the foundation did this
because they were monstrous.

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:47.267
I think they were clueless:
I think this was a unique moment

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.828
when the beautiful naivety of Twitter

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:53.161
was hitting the increasingly
horrific reality.

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:57.160
And here were some of the Tweets
that were cascading into his eye line,

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.910
as he was trying to apologize:

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:02.196
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us
into forgiving him."

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.295
(Laughter)

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.787
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven
that he is capable of feeling shame."

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.280
That one must have been written
by the best psychiatrist ever,

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:15.779
to know that about such
a tiny figure behind a lectern.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.152
And, "Jonah Lehrer is just
a frigging sociopath."

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:25.274
That last word is a very human thing
to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.

00:02:25.298 --> 00:02:29.475
It's because we want to destroy people
but not feel bad about it.

00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:32.951
Imagine if this was an actual court,

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:35.801
and the accused was in the dark,
begging for another chance,

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.566
and the jury was yelling out,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.277
"Bored! Sociopath!"

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:41.442
(Laughter)

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.485
You know, when we watch
courtroom dramas, we tend to identify

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.480
with the kindhearted defense attorney,

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:51.010
but give us the power,
and we become like hanging judges.

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.819
Power shifts fast.

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:58.780
We were getting Jonah because he was
perceived to have misused his privilege,

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:02.087
but Jonah was on the floor then,
and we were still kicking,

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.893
and congratulating ourselves
for punching up.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:09.933
And it began to feel weird and empty
when there wasn't a powerful person

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.975
who had misused their privilege
that we could get.

00:03:13.332 --> 00:03:16.634
A day without a shaming
began to feel like a day

00:03:16.658 --> 00:03:19.585
picking fingernails and treading water.

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:22.783
Let me tell you a story.

00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.982
It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.744
She was a PR woman from New York
with 170 Twitter followers,

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.724
and she'd Tweet little
acerbic jokes to them,

00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:37.371
like this one on a plane
from New York to London:

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:40.906
[Weird German Dude: You're in first class.
It's 2014. Get some deodorant."

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.032
-Inner monologue as inhale BO.
Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:47.319
So Justine chuckled to herself,
and pressed send, and got no replies,

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:49.404
and felt that sad feeling that we all feel

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:53.062
when the Internet doesn't
congratulate us for being funny.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:54.257
(Laughter)

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.404
Black silence when the Internet
doesn't talk back.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.182
And then she got to Heathrow,
and she had a little time to spare

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:05.982
before her final leg, so she thought up
another funny little acerbic joke:

00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:10.328
[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS.
Just kidding. I'm white!]

00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:16.478
And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,
got on the plane, got no replies,

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:19.085
turned off her phone, fell asleep,

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.098
woke up 11 hours later,

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:24.716
turned on her phone while the plane
was taxiing on the runway,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.097
and straightaway there was
a message from somebody

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.217
that she hadn't spoken
to since high school,

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:33.988
that said, "I am so sorry
to see what's happening to you."

00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:37.793
And then another message
from a best friend,

00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:39.831
"You need to call me right now.

00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:43.868
You are the worldwide number one
trending topic on Twitter."

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:45.602
(Laughter)

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:49.704
What had happened is that one
of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet

00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:54.628
to a Gawker journalist, and he
retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:

00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.872
[And now, a funny holiday joke
from IAC's PR boss]

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.859
And then it was like a bolt of lightning.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.385
A few weeks later, I talked
to the Gawker journalist.

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.097
I emailed him and asked him how it felt,
and he said, "It felt delicious."

00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:09.003
And then he said,
"But I'm sure she's fine."

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.761
But she wasn't fine,
because while she slept,

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:18.269
Twitter took control of her life
and dismantled it piece by piece.

00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:21.542
First there were the philanthropists:

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:24.048
[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate
words ... bother you,

00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:26.219
join me in supporting
@CARE's work in Africa.]

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:30.032
[In light of ... disgusting,
racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]

00:05:30.056 --> 00:05:31.547
Then came the beyond horrified:

00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.587
[... no words for that horribly disgusting
racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.

00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:36.762
I am beyond horrified.]

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.039
Was anybody on Twitter
that night? A few of you.

00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:42.533
Did Justine's joke overwhelm
your Twitter feed the way it did mine?

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:45.449
It did mine, and I thought
what everybody thought that night,

00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:48.561
which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.925
Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.257
And I sat up in my bed,

00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:55.205
and I put the pillow behind my head,

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.476
and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure
that joke was intended to be racist.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.262
Maybe instead of gleefully
flaunting her privilege,

00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:05.886
she was mocking the gleeful
flaunting of privilege.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.723
There's a comedy tradition of this,

00:06:07.747 --> 00:06:11.435
like South Park or Colbert
or Randy Newman.

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:15.904
Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being
as good at it as Randy Newman.

00:06:16.444 --> 00:06:19.364
In fact, when I met Justine
a couple of weeks later in a bar,

00:06:19.388 --> 00:06:21.477
she was just crushed,

00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.450
and I asked her to explain the joke,

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:27.109
and she said, "Living in America
puts us in a bit of a bubble

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.627
when it comes to what is going on
in the Third World.

00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:31.848
I was making of fun of that bubble."

00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:36.734
You know, another woman on Twitter that
night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,

00:06:36.758 --> 00:06:40.406
she reviewed my book on public shaming
and wrote that she Tweeted that night,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.720
"I'm not sure that her joke
was intended to be racist,"

00:06:43.744 --> 00:06:46.483
and she said straightaway she got
a fury of Tweets saying,

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.960
"Well, you're just
a privileged bitch, too."

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:51.220
And so to her shame, she wrote,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.776
she shut up and watched
as Justine's life got torn apart.

00:06:57.697 --> 00:06:59.506
It started to get darker:

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.440
[Everyone go report
this cunt @JustineSacco]

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:05.050
Then came the calls for her to be fired.

00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:07.946
[Good luck with the job hunt
in the new year. #GettingFired]

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.705
Thousands of people around the world

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.256
decided it was their duty
to get her fired.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.450
[@JustineSacco last tweet
of your career. #SorryNotSorry

00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:20.337
Corporations got involved,
hoping to sell their products

00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:22.718
on the back of Justine's annihilation:

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.959
[Next time you plan to tweet something
stupid before you take off,

00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:28.134
make sure you are getting
on a @Gogo flight!]

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:30.564
(Laughter)

00:07:30.588 --> 00:07:33.194
A lot of companies were making
good money that night.

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:37.135
You know, Justine's name was normally
Googled 40 times a month.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.487
That month, between December the 20th
and the end of December,

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:45.264
her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.

00:07:45.893 --> 00:07:49.418
And one Internet economist told me
that that meant that Google made

00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:54.452
somewhere between 120,000 dollars
and 468,000 dollars

00:07:54.476 --> 00:07:58.542
from Justine's annihilation, whereas
those of us doing the actual shaming --

00:07:58.566 --> 00:07:59.720
we got nothing.

00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:00.744
(Laughter)

00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:04.218
We were like unpaid
shaming interns for Google.

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:07.529
(Laughter)

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.949
And then came the trolls:

00:08:09.973 --> 00:08:12.704
[I'm actually kind of hoping
Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]

00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:14.134
Somebody else on that wrote,

00:08:14.158 --> 00:08:17.407
"Somebody HIV-positive should rape
this bitch and then we'll find out

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.510
if her skin color protects her from AIDS."

00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:22.113
And that person got a free pass.

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:24.224
Nobody went after that person.

00:08:24.248 --> 00:08:26.883
We were all so excited
about destroying Justine,

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.534
and our shaming brains
are so simple-minded,

00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:31.943
that we couldn't also handle
destroying somebody

00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:34.904
who was inappropriately
destroying Justine.

00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:39.223
Justine was really uniting
a lot of disparate groups that night,

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:42.183
from philanthropists to "rape the bitch."

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:46.506
[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!
You demented bitch...

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.118
Just let the world know you're planning
to ride bare back while in Africa.]

00:08:50.142 --> 00:08:52.167
Women always have it worse than men.

00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:55.292
When a man gets shamed, it's,
"I'm going to get you fired."

00:08:55.316 --> 00:08:57.014
When a woman gets shamed, it's,

00:08:57.038 --> 00:09:01.919
"I'm going to get you fired
and raped and cut out your uterus."

00:09:01.943 --> 00:09:04.352
And then Justine's employers got involved:

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:07.682
[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an
outrageous, offensive comment.

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:10.680
Employee in question currently
unreachable on an intl flight.]

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:12.902
And that's when the anger
turned to excitement:

00:09:12.926 --> 00:09:16.548
[All I want for Christmas is to see
@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands

00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:18.573
and she checks
her inbox/voicemail. #fired]

00:09:18.597 --> 00:09:21.288
[Oh man, @justinesacco
is going to have the most painful

00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:23.711
phone-turning-on moment ever
when her plane lands.]

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:27.151
[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco
bitch get fired. In REAL time.

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.199
Before she even KNOWS
she's getting fired.]

00:09:29.223 --> 00:09:31.236
What we had was
a delightful narrative arc.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.085
We knew something that Justine didn't.

00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:35.450
Can you think of anything
less judicial than this?

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:38.351
Justine was asleep on a plane
and unable to explain herself,

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:41.938
and her inability was
a huge part of the hilarity.

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:46.917
On Twitter that night, we were
like toddlers crawling towards a gun.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.794
Somebody worked out exactly
which plane she was on, so they linked

00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:52.917
to a flight tracker website.

00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:56.053
[British Airways Flight 43
On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]

00:09:56.077 --> 00:09:58.532
A hashtag began trending worldwide:

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.158
# hasJustineLandedYet?

00:10:01.182 --> 00:10:03.348
[It is kinda wild
to see someone self-destruct

00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:06.095
without them even being aware of it.
#hasJustineLandedYet]

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:09.513
[Seriously. I just want to go home
to go to bed, but everyone at the bar

00:10:09.537 --> 00:10:12.497
is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.
Can't look away. Can't leave.]

00:10:12.521 --> 00:10:16.007
[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best
thing to happen to my Friday night.]

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:19.134
[Is no one in Cape Town going
to the airport to tweet her arrival?

00:10:19.158 --> 00:10:20.877
Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures]

00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:22.417
And guess what? Yes there was.

00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:25.307
[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed
at Cape Town international.

00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:27.863
And if you want to know
what it looks like to discover

00:10:27.887 --> 00:10:31.462
that you've just been torn to shreds
because of a misconstrued liberal joke,

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:33.494
not by trolls, but by nice people like us,

00:10:33.518 --> 00:10:35.064
this is what it looks like:

00:10:35.088 --> 00:10:37.742
[... She's decided to wear
sunnies as a disguise.]

00:10:37.766 --> 00:10:39.219
So why did we do it?

00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.834
I think some people were genuinely upset,

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:44.286
but I think for other people,

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.333
it's because Twitter is basically
a mutual approval machine.

00:10:47.357 --> 00:10:50.276
We surround ourselves with people
who feel the same way we do,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.563
and we approve each other,

00:10:51.587 --> 00:10:53.238
and that's a really good feeling.

00:10:53.262 --> 00:10:55.910
And if somebody gets in the way,
we screen them out.

00:10:55.934 --> 00:10:58.021
And do you know what
that's the opposite of?

00:10:58.045 --> 00:10:59.786
It's the opposite of democracy.

00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:04.333
We wanted to show that we cared
about people dying of AIDS in Africa.

00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:08.364
Our desire to be seen to be compassionate
is what led us to commit

00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.433
this profoundly un-compassionate act.

00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:14.417
As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote
in the Boston Review,

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:18.852
"This isn't social justice.
It's a cathartic alternative."

00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:20.885
For the past three years,

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:24.187
I've been going around the world
meeting people like Justine Sacco --

00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.995
and believe me, there's a lot
of people like Justine Sacco.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.725
There's more every day.

00:11:28.749 --> 00:11:32.041
And we want to think they're fine,
but they're not fine.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:34.200
The people I met were mangled.

00:11:34.224 --> 00:11:36.065
They talked to me about depression,

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:40.005
and anxiety and insomnia
and suicidal thoughts.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.768
One woman I talked to,
who also told a joke that landed badly,

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.006
she stayed home for a year and a half.

00:11:47.427 --> 00:11:51.869
Before that, she worked with adults
with learning difficulties,

00:11:51.893 --> 00:11:54.331
and was apparently really good at her job.

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:59.175
Justine was fired, of course,
because social media demanded it.

00:11:59.607 --> 00:12:01.351
But it was worse than that.

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:03.334
She was losing herself.

00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:07.418
She was waking up in the middle
of the night, forgetting who she was.

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:12.035
She was got because she was perceived
to have misused her privilege.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.620
And of course, that's a much better thing
to get people for than the things

00:12:15.644 --> 00:12:18.804
we used to get people for,
like having children out of wedlock.

00:12:18.828 --> 00:12:21.659
But the phrase "misuse of privilege"
is becoming a free pass

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:25.111
to tear apart pretty much
anybody we choose to.

00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:27.441
It's becoming a devalued term,

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:30.450
and it's making us lose
our capacity for empathy

00:12:30.474 --> 00:12:35.394
and for distinguishing between serious
and unserious transgressions.

00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:39.863
Justine had 170 Twitter followers,
and so to make it work,

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:41.856
she had to be fictionalized.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.695
Word got around that she was the daughter
the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.

00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:50.343
[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco
her father is a SA mining billionaire.

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:52.422
She's not sorry.
And neither is her father.]

00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:54.269
I thought that was true about Justine,

00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:57.631
until I met her at a bar, and I asked her
about her billionaire father,

00:12:57.655 --> 00:12:59.568
and she said, "My father sells carpets."

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:01.749
And I think back on
the early days of Twitter,

00:13:01.773 --> 00:13:04.503
when people would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:07.453
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

00:13:07.477 --> 00:13:11.650
These days, the hunt is on
for people's shameful secrets.

00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:13.716
You can lead a good, ethical life,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.174
but some bad phraseology in a Tweet
can overwhelm it all,

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:21.182
become a clue to your secret inner evil.

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:24.236
Maybe there's two types
of people in the world:

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.787
those people who favor
humans over ideology,

00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:30.717
and those people who favor
ideology over humans.

00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:33.755
I favor humans over ideology,

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.540
but right now, the ideologues are winning,

00:13:36.564 --> 00:13:41.234
and they're creating a stage
for constant artificial high dramas

00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:43.686
where everybody's either
a magnificent hero

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.318
or a sickening villain,

00:13:45.342 --> 00:13:48.359
even though we know that's not true
about our fellow humans.

00:13:48.383 --> 00:13:52.369
What's true is that
we are clever and stupid;

00:13:52.393 --> 00:13:55.579
what's true is that we're grey areas.

00:13:55.603 --> 00:13:58.481
The great thing about social media
was how it gave a voice

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.901
to voiceless people,

00:13:59.925 --> 00:14:02.579
but we're now creating
a surveillance society,

00:14:02.603 --> 00:14:06.953
where the smartest way to survive
is to go back to being voiceless.

00:14:07.423 --> 00:14:08.856
Let's not do that.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.032
Thank you.

00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:15.774
(Applause)

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.895
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:24.165
Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.

00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:25.363
BG: Don't go away.

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:28.734
What strikes me about Justine's story

00:14:28.758 --> 00:14:31.191
is also the fact that if you
Google her name today,

00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:33.962
this story covers the first
100 pages of Google results --

00:14:33.986 --> 00:14:36.198
there is nothing else about her.

00:14:36.222 --> 00:14:38.810
In your book, you mention another story

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:43.365
of another victim who actually got
taken on by a reputation management firm,

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:48.473
and by creating blogs and posting nice,
innocuous stories about her love for cats

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:51.213
and holidays and stuff,
managed to get the story

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:55.160
off the first couple pages of Google
results, but it didn't last long.

00:14:55.184 --> 00:15:00.137
A couple of weeks later, they started
creeping back up to the top result.

00:15:00.161 --> 00:15:02.109
Is this a totally lost battle?

00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:05.317
Jon Ronson: You know, I think
the very best thing we can do,

00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:09.915
if you see a kind of unfair
or an ambiguous shaming,

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:13.339
is to speak up, because I think
the worst thing that happened to Justine

00:15:13.363 --> 00:15:16.379
was that nobody supported her --
like, everyone was against her,

00:15:16.403 --> 00:15:18.128
and that is profoundly traumatizing,

00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:21.974
to be told by tens of thousands of people
that you need to get out.

00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:26.088
But if a shaming happens and there's
a babble of voices, like in a democracy,

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:29.208
where people are discussing it,
I think that's much less damaging.

00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:30.859
So I think that's the way forward,

00:15:30.883 --> 00:15:33.479
but it's hard, because if you do
stand up for somebody,

00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:35.199
it's incredibly unpleasant.

00:15:35.223 --> 00:15:37.143
BG: So let's talk about your experience,

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:39.175
because you stood up by writing this book.

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.788
By the way, it's mandatory
reading for everybody, okay?

00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:46.122
You stood up because the book
actually puts the spotlight on shamers.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:49.178
And I assume you didn't only
have friendly reactions on Twitter.

00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:51.882
JR: It didn't go down that well
with some people.

00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:52.907
(Laughter)

00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:55.035
I mean, you don't want
to just concentrate --

00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:58.456
because lots of people understood,
and were really nice about the book.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.833
But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing
stories about abuses of power,

00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:05.137
and when I say the powerful people
over there in the military,

00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:07.929
or in the pharmaceutical industry,
everybody applauds me.

00:16:07.953 --> 00:16:12.328
As soon as I say, "We are the powerful
people abusing our power now,"

00:16:12.352 --> 00:16:15.076
I get people saying,
"Well you must be a racist too."

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.775
BG: So the other night --
yesterday -- we were at dinner,

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.714
and there were two discussions going on.

00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:22.786
On one side you were talking
with people around the table --

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.973
and that was a nice,
constructive discussion.

00:16:24.997 --> 00:16:27.344
On the other, every time
you turned to your phone,

00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:28.929
there is this deluge of insults.

00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:32.344
JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
We had like a TED dinner last night.

00:16:32.368 --> 00:16:36.168
We were chatting and it was lovely
and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.

00:16:36.192 --> 00:16:38.312
Somebody said, "You are
a white supremacist."

00:16:38.336 --> 00:16:41.310
And then I went back and had
a nice conversation with somebody,

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.875
and then I went back to Twitter,

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:45.987
somebody said my very existence
made the world a worse place.

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:48.758
My friend Adam Curtis says

00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:52.590
that maybe the Internet is like
a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,

00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:55.655
when eventually everyone
will start screaming at each other

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.209
and shooting each other,
and then eventually everybody

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:00.229
would flee to somewhere safer,

00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:04.153
and I'm starting to think of that
as a really nice option.

00:17:04.177 --> 00:17:06.130
BG: Jon, thank you.
JR: Thank you, Bruno.

00:17:06.154 --> 00:17:10.152
(Applause)
