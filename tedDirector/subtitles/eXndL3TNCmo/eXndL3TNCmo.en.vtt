00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and at IDEO this past year,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but I've been to a lot of them since that time.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so thinking back, I was thinking

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
certainly technological objects.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who are in the audience were my clients.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and we'd put it on the conference table,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That was a really good time.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And if you were here last year,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I took a lot of pictures last year;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This year -- maybe you could show the slides --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and helped Handspring design it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Also, though we designed it a few years ago --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Lots of lives are being saved by those.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, we really will continue to focus on products.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and that's that people like us --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
human-centeredness in an approach to design.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And I think you're starting to see that,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and it's making our job even more enjoyable.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But firms like ours are having to move to a point where

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
showing how they'll be used.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And so in order to do that we've been forming

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
internal video-production groups

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in order to make these kind of experience prototypes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And it's a much better way to see.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
as opposed to them being empty.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So I thought that I would show you a few videos

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to show off this new, broader definition

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of design in products and services and environments.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
or a minute-and-a-half apiece --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
work over the last year, and how it responds in video.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and OMA to help us conceive the technology

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that's in their retail store in New York.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And that meant actually designing custom technology

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
there's RF tags on the user, on the cards,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
there's the staff devices that are all around the store.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the staff person can scan them in

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and in the dressing room there are scanners

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We can put that up on a touch screen

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and you can play with that, and get more information

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The last time I went to see this store,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And then one of my favorite features of the technology

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
but there's a three second delay.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
(Applause)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
About a year and a half ago we were asked to design

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
an installation in the museum --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I don't know if anybody's seen this --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
it's pretty spectacular in the room.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Anyway, it's based on the London subway system.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And so you can see that

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the goal is to bring some of the feedback

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that the people who had gone to the museum were giving,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the little trains go around with what you're thinking about.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
mostly teenagers coming out of there --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
there's this big open space that has these tables in it

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that have interactive games which are quite fun,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And the topics include things that the museum is about:

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
or what a driverless car might be like.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
There's lots of room, so people can come up

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and understand what it is before they get involved.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and go off into the atmosphere.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The next video is not done by us.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Scott Adams ran into us

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and asked us if we wouldn't help to design

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
He's always been interested in technology in the future.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with some of the smartest design guys in the world

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the team built their own little cubicles

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to fully experience the problems.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Narrator: They took pictures.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and you're sort of held captive there for a minute.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We'll see what happens.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for the computer and for family photos.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and actually give Dilbert a group hug.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Laughter)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So you feel that in your cubicle.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that wilts when you leave in disappointment,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or something to be aggressive with to release tension.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that stretches across your cubicle.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
as well as wastewater.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So this building actually celebrates the water

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
so that it can be filtered for the final time.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
kind of wild and crazy and everybody's

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But it was intended to be quite quiet.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And then you would wander around and gather information,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
once it comes through the plant.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And then, if you saw,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You can see: there's the plant.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And we're announcing a new product here tonight,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
started by Nigel Jagger in London.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and actually seeing what's there,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and enjoying what scuba divers do.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This product, it has two cameras.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You throw it over the side of your boat

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
so that the interface doesn't get in your way.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And the other one was to design the object

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
seven or eight years, this project --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and [we're] just ready to start building them.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and is equipped with powerful lights.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You watch the video with superimposed graphics

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that indicate your depth and compass heading.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to help you completely lose yourself underwater.)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
(Applause)

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
which is a project that I'm very excited about.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and he had a very interesting insight, which is that

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
he said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
there must be entrepreneurs everywhere."

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
they could find enough money to put something together.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
with Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
he's started 19,000 companies.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
He's made 30,000 new jobs.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So we're in the process of helping them design

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
deep-well, low-cost manual pumps

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to be able to grow crops in the off-season.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
but they can't grow them in the off-season.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
very straightforward things that we're designing --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
my students are doing this as class projects

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and so --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(Laughter)

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Laughter)

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Can you read it?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Laughter)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
(Laughter)

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000
(Applause)

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and from all the different presenters.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and I think this is great.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Designers are more trusted and more integrated

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
into the business strategy of companies,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.
