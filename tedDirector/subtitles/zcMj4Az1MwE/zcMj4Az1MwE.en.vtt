00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:14.821
When I die,

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:19.928
I would like for my body
to be laid out to be eaten by animals.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.631
Having your body laid out to be eaten
by animals is not for everyone.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:26.688
(Laughter)

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.665
Maybe you have already had
the end-of-life talk with your family

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.409
and decided on,
I don't know, cremation.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.399
And in the interest of full disclosure,

00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:43.411
what I am proposing for my dead body
is not strictly legal at the moment,

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.426
but it's not without precedent.

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:49.512
We've been laying out our dead
for all of human history;

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:51.605
it's call exposure burial.

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:56.176
In fact, it's likely happening
right now as we speak.

00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:58.915
In the mountainous regions of Tibet,

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.003
they practice "sky burial,"

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.918
a ritual where the body is left
to be consumed by vultures.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:10.771
In Mumbai, in India,
those who follow the Parsi religion

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:15.072
put their dead in structures
called "Towers of Silence."

00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:18.031
These are interesting cultural tidbits,

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.503
but they just haven't really been
that popular in the Western world --

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:24.227
they're not what you'd expect.

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:30.008
In America, our death traditions
have come to be chemical embalming,

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:33.413
followed by burial at your local cemetery,

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:35.757
or, more recently, cremation.

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:40.106
I myself, am a recent vegetarian,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.749
which means I spent the first
30 years or so of my life

00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:45.980
frantically inhaling animals --

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:47.982
as many as I could get my hands on.

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:53.286
Why, when I die, should they not
have their turn with me?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.077
(Laughter)

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.981
Am I not an animal?

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.769
Biologically speaking,
are we not all, in this room, animals?

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:05.601
Accepting the fact that we are animals

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.756
has some potentially
terrifying consequences.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.248
It means accepting
that we are doomed to decay and die,

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:16.514
just like any other creature on earth.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.690
For the last nine years,
I've worked in the funeral industry,

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:23.845
first as a crematory operator,

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.347
then as a mortician

00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:28.483
and most recently, as the owner
of my own funeral home.

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:30.894
And I have some good news:

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:36.490
if you're looking to avoid the whole
"doomed to decay and die" thing:

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:40.730
you will have all the help
in the world in that avoidance

00:02:40.754 --> 00:02:42.531
from the funeral industry.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.805
It's a multi-billion-dollar industry,

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.813
and its economic model
is based on the principle

00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:54.316
of protection, sanitation
and beautification of the corpse.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.602
Whether they mean to or not,

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:02.119
the funeral industry promotes
this idea of human exceptionalism.

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:04.278
It doesn't matter what it takes,

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:05.594
how much it costs,

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.576
how bad it is for the environment,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.873
we're going to do it
because humans are worth it!

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:13.355
It ignores the fact

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.466
that death can be an emotionally messy
and complex affair,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.034
and that there is beauty in decay --

00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:25.471
beauty in the natural return
to the earth from whence we came.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.916
Now, I don't want you to get me wrong --

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.927
I absolutely understand
the importance of ritual,

00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:35.052
especially when it comes
to the people that we love.

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:38.611
But we have to be able
to create and practice this ritual

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.416
without harming the environment,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.379
which is why we need new options.

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:49.275
So let's return to the idea of protection,
sanitation and beautification.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.075
We'll start with a dead body.

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.691
The funeral industry
will protect your dead body

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:59.556
by offering to sell your family a casket
made of hardwood or metal

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.459
with a rubber sealant.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:05.654
At the cemetery, on the day of burial,
that casket will be lowered

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.815
into a large concrete or metal vault.

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:13.497
We're wasting all of these resources --
concretes, metal, hardwoods --

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:17.286
hiding them in vast
underground fortresses.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.668
When you choose burial at the cemetery,

00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:25.985
your dead body is not coming anywhere
near the dirt that surrounds it.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.124
Food for worms

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:29.325
you are not.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:35.296
Next, the industry will sanitize
your body through embalming:

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.521
the chemical preservation of the dead.

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:40.060
This procedure drains your blood

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:44.386
and replaces it with a toxic,
cancer-causing formaldehyde.

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.812
They say they do this
for the public health

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:50.686
because the dead body can be dangerous,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.209
but the doctors in this room will tell you

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:55.987
that that claim would only apply

00:04:56.011 --> 00:05:00.927
if the person had died of some wildly
infectious disease, like Ebola.

00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:05.080
Even human decomposition,
which, let's be honest,

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:08.094
is a little stinky and unpleasant,

00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:09.861
is perfectly safe.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:15.123
The bacteria that causes disease
is not the same bacteria

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.121
that causes decomposition.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:22.416
Finally, the industry
will beautify the corpse.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:26.890
They'll tell you that the natural
dead body of your mother or father

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:28.998
is not good enough as it is.

00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.213
They'll put it in makeup.

00:05:31.237 --> 00:05:33.028
They'll put it in a suit.

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:36.991
They'll inject dyes so the person
looks a little more alive --

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:38.301
just resting.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:41.758
Embalming is a cheat code,

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:46.179
providing the illusion that death
and then decay are not the natural end

00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:49.088
for all organic life on this planet.

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.447
Now, if this system of beautification,
sanitation, protection

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.664
doesn't appeal to you,

00:05:57.688 --> 00:05:59.087
you are not alone.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.626
There is a whole wave of people --

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.614
funeral directors, designers,
environmentalists --

00:06:04.638 --> 00:06:08.449
trying to come up with a more
eco-friendly way of death.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.683
For these people, death is not necessarily

00:06:11.707 --> 00:06:15.899
a pristine, makeup,
powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:17.964
There's no question

00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:21.915
that our current methods of death
are not particularly sustainable,

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.575
what with the waste of resources
and our reliance on chemicals.

00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:27.660
Even cremation,

00:06:27.684 --> 00:06:31.402
which is usually considered
the environmentally friendly option,

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:33.664
uses, per cremation,

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:38.588
the natural gas equivalent
of a 500-mile car trip.

00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:42.302
So where do we go from here?

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:46.540
Last summer, I was in the mountains
of North Carolina,

00:06:46.564 --> 00:06:49.911
hauling buckets of wood chips
in the summer sun.

00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:54.750
I was at Western Carolina University
at their "Body Farm,"

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:58.606
more accurately called
a "human decomposition facility."

00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:01.859
Bodies donated to science
are brought here,

00:07:01.883 --> 00:07:05.907
and their decay is studied
to benefit the future of forensics.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.928
On this particular day,

00:07:07.952 --> 00:07:12.523
there were 12 bodies laid out
in various stages of decomposition.

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:14.828
Some were skeletonized,

00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:17.224
one was wearing purple pajamas,

00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:19.984
one still had blonde facial hair visible.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.939
The forensic aspect is really fascinating,

00:07:23.963 --> 00:07:26.359
but not actually why I was there.

00:07:26.383 --> 00:07:29.645
I was there because a colleague of mine
named Katrina Spade

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:34.009
is attempting to create a system,
not of cremating the dead,

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:35.983
but composting the dead.

00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:39.263
She calls the system "Recomposition,"

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:42.959
and we've been doing it with cattle
and other livestock for years.

00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:44.989
She imagines a facility

00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.639
where the family could come
and lay their dead loved one

00:07:47.663 --> 00:07:52.094
in a nutrient-rich mixture that would,
in four-to-six weeks,

00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:55.722
reduce the body -- bones
and all -- to soil.

00:07:56.622 --> 00:07:58.067
In those four-to-six weeks,

00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:00.549
your molecules become other molecules;

00:08:00.573 --> 00:08:02.311
you literally transform.

00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:06.579
How would this fit in
with the very recent desire

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.205
a lot of people seem to have

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:09.734
to be buried under a tree,

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:11.819
or to become a tree when they die?

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.060
In a traditional cremation,
the ashes that are left over --

00:08:16.084 --> 00:08:18.070
inorganic bone fragments --

00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:20.345
form a thick, chalky layer

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:23.592
that, unless distributed
in the soil just right,

00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:26.793
can actually hurt or kill the tree.

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:30.677
But if you're recomposed,
if you actually become the soil,

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:32.235
you can nourish the tree,

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.948
and become the post-mortem contributor
you've always wanted to be --

00:08:35.972 --> 00:08:37.765
that you deserve to be.

00:08:38.638 --> 00:08:41.981
So that's one option
for the future of cremation.

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:44.390
But what about the future of cemeteries?

00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:48.997
There are a lot of people who think
we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore

00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:51.060
because we're running out of land.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:54.010
But what if we reframed it,

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.639
and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,

00:08:56.663 --> 00:08:58.622
but its potential savior?

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:02.178
I'm talking about conservation burial,

00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:06.261
where large swaths of land
are purchased by a land trust.

00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:11.924
The beauty of this is that once you plant
a few dead bodies in that land,

00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:14.966
it can't be touched,
it can't be developed on --

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.788
hence the term, "conservation burial."

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:21.694
It's the equivalent of chaining yourself
to a tree post-mortem --

00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:24.182
"Hell no, I won't go!

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:27.251
No, really -- I can't.
I'm decomposing under here."

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.370
(Laughter)

00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:30.715
Any money that the family
gives to the cemetery

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:34.248
would go back into protecting
and managing the land.

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:39.595
There are no headstones
and no graves in the typical sense.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:41.766
The graves are scattered
about the property

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.350
under elegant mounds,

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:47.055
marked only by a rock
or a small metal disk,

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:49.977
or sometimes only locatable by GPS.

00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:52.237
There's no embalming,

00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.460
no heavy, metal caskets.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.325
My funeral home sells a few caskets

00:09:57.349 --> 00:10:01.101
made out of things like
woven willow and bamboo,

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:04.848
but honestly, most of our families
just choose a simple shroud.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:09.639
There are none of the big vaults
that most cemeteries require

00:10:09.663 --> 00:10:12.982
just because it makes it easier
for them to landscape.

00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:17.453
Families can come here;
they can luxuriate in nature;

00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:20.154
they can even plant a tree or a shrub,

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:23.180
though only native plants
to the area are allowed.

00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:27.613
The dead then blend seamlessly
in with the landscape.

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:31.230
There's hope in conservation cemeteries.

00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:36.733
They offer dedicated green space
in both urban and rural areas.

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:41.929
They offer a chance to reintroduce
native plants and animals to a region.

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.715
They offer public trails,

00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:46.787
places for spiritual practice,

00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:49.926
places for classes and events --

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.102
places where nature and mourning meet.

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:57.667
Most importantly,
they offer us, once again,

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:02.818
a chance to just decompose
in a hole in the ground.

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:05.175
The soil,

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:06.867
let me tell you,

00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:08.420
has missed us.

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:11.007
I think for a lot of people,

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:12.628
they're starting to get the sense

00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:16.961
that our current funeral industry
isn't really working for them.

00:11:18.118 --> 00:11:19.308
For many of us,

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:23.743
being sanitized and beautified
just doesn't reflect us.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:26.996
It doesn't reflect
what we stood for during our lives.

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:31.753
Will changing the way we bury our dead
solve climate change?

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.419
No.

00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:35.897
But it will make bold moves

00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:39.451
in how we see ourselves
as citizens of this planet.

00:11:40.474 --> 00:11:45.082
If we can die in a way
that is more humble and self-aware,

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:47.606
I believe that we stand a chance.

00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:49.296
Thank you.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.561
(Applause)
