00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm going to show you how terrorism

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
actually interacts with our daily life.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
in Italian jails.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Now, as many of you may remember,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
which was very active in Italy

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
As part of their strategy

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
They sat in silence through their trails,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
waving occasionally at family and friends.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.260
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and tell their story.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And I was one of those people.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
he said that the female members of the organization

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
had actually supported my name.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
In particular, one person had put it forward.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
She was my childhood friend.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
She had joined the Red Brigades

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
and became a leader of the organization.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Naturally, I didn't know that

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
until the day she was arrested.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
At the time of the phone call

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I just had a baby,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I successfully completed a management buyout

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
to the company I was working with,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and touring the high-security prisons.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
But this is exactly what I did

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
because I wanted to know

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
what had turned my best friend

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
into a terrorist,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and why she'd never tried to recruit me.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
(Laughter)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
(Applause)

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So, this is exactly what I did.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Now, I found the answer very quickly.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I actually had failed

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the psychological profiling of a terrorist.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
The center committee of the Red Brigades

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
had judged me too single-minded

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
because she was very good at following orders.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
She also embraced violence.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Because she believed that the only way

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
to unblock what, at the time,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
was known as a blocked democracy,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.260
was the arms struggle.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I also discovered that their life was not ruled

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
by politics or ideology,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
but actually was ruled by economics.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
They were constantly short of cash.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
They were constantly searching for cash.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Now, contrary to what many people believe,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
terrorism is actually a very expensive business.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I'll give you an idea.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.260
In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
on a yearly basis

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
was seven million dollars.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
This is roughly between 100

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
and 150 million, today.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Now, you know, if you live underground

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
it's really hard to produce this amount of money.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.260
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and then, later on, other arms organizations,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
everybody was extremely reluctant

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
to talk about ideology, or politics.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Because they had no idea.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
The political vision of a terrorist organization

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
is decided by the leadership,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
All the others do, day in and day out,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
is search for money.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Once, for example, I was interviewing

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
this part-timer from the Red Brigades.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.260
He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And he told me that the best time of his life

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
was when he was a member of the Red Brigades

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
from Lebanon, where he would pick up

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Soviet weapons from the PLO,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and then carry them all the way to Sardinia

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
where the other arms organization from Europe would go

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and take their share of the arms.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.260
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
which went to fund their organization.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So, because I am a trained economist

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
and I think in economic terms,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
all of the sudden I thought,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
maybe there is something here.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.260
between one organization and another one.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
But it was only when I interviewed

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Italian former prime minister,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
that I finally realized

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that terrorism is actually business.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
I was having lunch with him

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
in a high-security prison in Italy.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And as we were eating,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
I had the distinct feeling

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that I was back in the city of London,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.260
having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
This guy thought in the same way I did.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.260
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.260
asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So, in the end, I took a decision

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that, in retrospect, did change my life.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I sold my company,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and funded the research myself.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And what I discovered

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
is this parallel reality,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.260
another international economic system,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
which runs parallel to our own,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
which has been created by arms organizations

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
since the end of World War II.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And what is even more shocking

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.260
is that this system

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
has followed, step by step, the evolution

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
of our own system,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
of our Western capitalism.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And there are three main stages.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
So, state sponsor of terrorism,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
feature of the Cold War.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This is when the two superpowers were fighting

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
a war by proxy,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
along the periphery of the sphere of influence,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
fully funding arms organizations.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So, the link between crime and terror

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is established very early on.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And here is the best example,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
legally funded by the U.S. Congress,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
illegally funded by the Reagan administration

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:47.260
via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and some groups successfully carry out

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
the privatization of terrorism.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So, they gain independence from the sponsor,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and start funding themselves.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.260
Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
So, Arafat used to get a percentage

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
of the smuggling of hashish

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So, every single time

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
without knowing, actually,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
was funding the IRA.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
But the great change came, of course,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
with globalization and deregulation.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
This is when arms organization were able to link up,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
also financially, with each other.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
But above all, they started to do

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
serious business with the world of crime.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
And together they money-laundered

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
their dirty business through the same channel.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
This is when we see the birth of the transnational

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
arms organization Al Qaeda.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
This is an organization that can raise money across border.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
But also that is able to carry out attacks

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
in more than one country.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Now, deregulation also brought back

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
rogue economics.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
So what is rogue economics?

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
lurking in the background of history.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
It comes back at times of great transformation,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
globalization being one of those transformations.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
It is at this times in which

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
politics actually loses control of the economy,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and the economy becomes a rogue force

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
working against us.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.260
It has happened before in history.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.260
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.260
And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Now, I calculated how big was this international

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
economic system composed by crime,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
terror, and illegal economy,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
before 9-11.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
It is trillions, it's not billions.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
soon will be more,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
considering where this country is going.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
(Laughter)

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Now, until 9-11,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
the bulk of all this money

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
flew into the U.S. economy

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
and the money laundering was taking place

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
inside the United States.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
The entry point, of course, of most of this money

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
were the off-shore facilities.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
So, this was a vital injection of cash

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
into the U.S. economy.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
the U.S. money supply is the amount

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
of dollars that the Federal Reserve

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
prints every year

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
in order to satisfy

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
the increase in the demand for dollars,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
which, of course, reflects the growth

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
of the economy.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.260
So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.260
a growing number of these dollars

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
was actually leaving the United States,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
never to come back.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
These were money taken out

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
These were money taken out to fund

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
the growth of the terror,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.260
illegal and criminal economy.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
So, you see, what is the relationship?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.260
The United States actually is a country

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.260
that is the reserve currency of the world.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
What does it mean? That means that

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
it has a privilege that other countries do not have.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
in circulation in the world.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
This privilege is called seigniorage.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
No other country can do that.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.260
can borrow only against the amount of money

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.260
in circulation inside its own borders.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
So, here is the implication of the relationship

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.260
between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
The U.S. in the 1990s

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
was borrowing against the growth

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.260
of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
This is how close we are with this world.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
because George Bush launched the War on Terror.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Part of the War on Terror

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
was the introduction of the Patriot Act.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
is a legislation that greatly reduces

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
the liberties of Americans in order to protect them

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
against terrorism.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
But there is a section of the Patriot Act

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
which refers specifically to finance.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
What the Patriot Act did was

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
to prohibit U.S. bank,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
and U.S.-registered foreign banks

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.260
from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
It closed that door between the money laundering

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
in dollars, and the U.S. economy.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.260
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
the right to monitor any dollar transaction

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.260
taking place anywhere in the world.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
finance and banking.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
All the bankers said to their clients,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.260
of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And this is what people did.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
to check their relationship,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to monitor their relationship with their clientele.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
The same thing happened, of course,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.260
in the world of crime and terror.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:14.260
People simply moved their money-laundering activities

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
away from the United States

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
into Europe.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Why did this happen? This happened because

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
It was introduced only in the United States.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
In Europe, a similar legislation

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
was not introduced.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
So, within six months

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
Europe became the epicenter

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
of the money-laundering activities

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
of the world.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So, this is how incredible are the relationship

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
between the world of crime

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and the world of terror,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and our own life.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
So, why did I tell you this story?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
I told you this story because you

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
must understand that there is a world

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.260
that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
including the personal relationship that you have

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
with friends and family.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
You got to question everything that is told to you,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
including what I just told you today.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
(Laughter)

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
This is the only way for you

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And believe me,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
it's going to be scary.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
(Laughter)

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.260
(Applause)
