00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:14.828
When we talk about corruption,

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:18.298
there are typical types
of individuals that spring to mind.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.626
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.815
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.803
Until his death in 2006,

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:29.109
he was the all-powerful
leader of Turkmenistan,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.874
a Central Asian country
rich in natural gas.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:36.824
Now, he really loved to issue
presidential decrees.

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:39.069
And one renamed the months of the year

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:42.219
including after himself and his mother.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:44.253
He spent millions of dollars

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.073
creating a bizarre personality cult,

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.042
and his crowning glory was the building

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:53.082
of a 40-foot-high gold-plated
statue of himself

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:56.146
which stood proudly
in the capital's central square

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.138
and rotated to follow the sun.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.911
He was a slightly unusual guy.

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:03.768
And then there's that cliché,

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:07.167
the African dictator
or minister or official.

00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:10.278
There's Teodorín Obiang.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:14.509
So his daddy is president
for life of Equatorial Guinea,

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.633
a West African nation that has exported

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:21.114
billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s

00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:25.158
and yet has a truly appalling
human rights record.

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:27.052
The vast majority of its people

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.007
are living in really miserable poverty

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.127
despite an income
per capita that's on a par

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.625
with that of Portugal.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.330
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:41.762
a $30 million mansion
in Malibu, California.

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:42.863
I've been up to its front gates.

00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:45.958
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.

00:01:45.982 --> 00:01:49.677
He bought an €18 million art collection

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:53.816
that used to belong to fashion
designer Yves Saint Laurent,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.364
a stack of fabulous sports cars,

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.919
some costing a million dollars apiece --

00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:00.235
oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.596
Now get this:

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.737
Until recently, he was earning
an official monthly salary

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.891
of less than 7,000 dollars.

00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:11.944
And there's Dan Etete.

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:14.588
Well, he was the former
oil minister of Nigeria

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:16.562
under President Abacha,

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:20.064
and it just so happens
he's a convicted money launderer too.

00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:22.306
We've spent a great deal of time

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.707
investigating a $1 billion --

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:26.470
that's right, a $1 billion —

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:29.131
oil deal that he was involved with,

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:31.083
and what we found was pretty shocking,

00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:33.849
but more about that later.

00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:37.366
So it's easy to think
that corruption happens

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.226
somewhere over there,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.682
carried out by a bunch of greedy despots

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.706
and individuals up to no good in countries

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.714
that we, personally, may
know very little about

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:48.403
and feel really unconnected to

00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:51.891
and unaffected by what might be going on.

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:55.134
But does it just happen over there?

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.413
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:01.194
My first job out of university

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:05.178
was investigating the illegal
trade in African ivory.

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:09.407
And that's how my relationship
with corruption really began.

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.415
In 1993, with two friends
who were colleagues,

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.218
Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:18.819
we set up an organization
called Global Witness.

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:21.569
Our first campaign
was investigating the role

00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:25.875
of illegal logging in funding
the war in Cambodia.

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.918
So a few years later, and it's now 1997,

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:33.679
and I'm in Angola undercover
investigating blood diamonds.

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:35.406
Perhaps you saw the film,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.097
the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:38.674
the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:42.129
Well, some of that sprang from our work.

00:03:42.153 --> 00:03:44.845
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.025
who were struggling
to survive on the streets

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.113
and war orphans living
in sewers under the streets,

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.202
and a tiny, very wealthy elite

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:55.421
who gossiped about shopping
trips to Brazil and Portugal.

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:58.182
And it was a slightly crazy place.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:01.866
So I'm sitting in a hot
and very stuffy hotel room

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.926
feeling just totally overwhelmed.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.282
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.

00:04:07.306 --> 00:04:10.184
Because I'd been speaking
to lots of people there

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.552
who, well, they talked
about a different problem:

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:15.973
that of a massive web
of corruption on a global scale

00:04:15.997 --> 00:04:19.307
and millions of oil dollars going missing.

00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.768
And for what was then
a very small organization

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.916
of just a few people,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.658
trying to even begin to think
how we might tackle that

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:29.129
was an enormous challenge.

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:30.677
And in the years that I've been,

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.232
and we've all been campaigning
and investigating,

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.495
I've repeatedly seen
that what makes corruption

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.763
on a global, massive scale possible,

00:04:37.787 --> 00:04:40.897
well it isn't just greed
or the misuse of power

00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.336
or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.373
I mean, yes, it's all of those,

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:48.325
but corruption, it's made
possible by the actions

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.946
of global facilitators.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.136
So let's go back to some of those
people I talked about earlier.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.653
Now, they're all people
we've investigated,

00:04:56.677 --> 00:04:59.439
and they're all people who couldn't
do what they do alone.

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:01.879
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:05.718
with high-end art and luxury
houses without help.

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.893
He did business with global banks.

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:11.732
A bank in Paris held accounts
of companies controlled by him,

00:05:11.756 --> 00:05:14.130
one of which was used to buy the art,

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:16.771
and American banks, well, they funneled

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:19.707
73 million dollars into the States,

00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:23.806
some of which was used to buy
that California mansion.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.714
And he didn't do all of this
in his own name either.

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:28.468
He used shell companies.

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:30.802
He used one to buy
the property, and another,

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:32.888
which was in somebody else's name,

00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:36.886
to pay the huge bills it
cost to run the place.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.114
And then there's Dan Etete.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.196
Well, when he was oil minister,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.326
he awarded an oil block now
worth over a billion dollars

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.160
to a company that, guess what, yeah,

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:51.543
he was the hidden owner of.

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:54.945
Now, it was then much later traded on

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.541
with the kind assistance
of the Nigerian government --

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.623
now I have to be careful what I say here —

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:03.772
to subsidiaries of Shell
and the Italian Eni,

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.426
two of the biggest oil companies around.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.879
So the reality is,
is that the engine of corruption,

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:11.322
well, it exists far
beyond the shores of countries

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:14.521
like Equatorial Guinea
or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.

00:06:14.545 --> 00:06:16.845
This engine, well, it's driven

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.211
by our international banking system,

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:21.754
by the problem of anonymous
shell companies,

00:06:21.778 --> 00:06:24.136
and by the secrecy that we have afforded

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.105
big oil, gas and mining operations,

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.838
and, most of all, by the failure
of our politicians

00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:32.913
to back up their rhetoric and do something

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:37.905
really meaningful and systemic
to tackle this stuff.

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:39.916
Now let's take the banks first.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.250
Well, it's not going
to come as any surprise

00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:46.562
for me to tell you that banks
accept dirty money,

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:51.106
but they prioritize their profits
in other destructive ways too.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.213
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.

00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:57.852
Now this region, it has just five percent

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:03.268
of its forests left intact. Five percent.

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:04.603
So how did that happen?

00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:07.659
Well, because an elite
and its facilitators

00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:09.833
have been making millions of dollars

00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:13.364
from supporting logging
on an industrial scale

00:07:13.388 --> 00:07:15.770
for many years.

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:18.024
So we sent an undercover investigator in

00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:21.614
to secretly film meetings
with members of the ruling elite,

00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:24.945
and the resulting footage, well,
it made some people very angry,

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.195
and you can see that on YouTube,

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.172
but it proved what we had long suspected,

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:32.669
because it showed
how the state's chief minister,

00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:34.579
despite his later denials,

00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:37.978
used his control over land
and forest licenses

00:07:38.002 --> 00:07:41.009
to enrich himself and his family.

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:45.608
And HSBC, well, we know
that HSBC bankrolled

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.617
the region's largest logging companies

00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:50.022
that were responsible
for some of that destruction

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:52.609
in Sarawak and elsewhere.

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:56.317
The bank violated its own
sustainability policies in the process,

00:07:56.341 --> 00:08:00.137
but it earned around 130 million dollars.

00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:02.473
Now shortly after our exposé,

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:05.075
very shortly after our exposé
earlier this year,

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.079
the bank announced
a policy review on this.

00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:10.665
And is this progress? Maybe,

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:13.168
but we're going to be
keeping a very close eye

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.505
on that case.

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:18.918
And then there's the problem
of anonymous shell companies.

00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:21.747
Well, we've all heard
about what they are, I think,

00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.243
and we all know they're used quite a bit

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:26.829
by people and companies
who are trying to avoid

00:08:26.853 --> 00:08:29.876
paying their proper dues to society,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.929
also known as taxes.

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:34.838
But what doesn't usually come to light

00:08:34.862 --> 00:08:39.388
is how shell companies are used to steal

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:42.760
huge sums of money,
transformational sums of money,

00:08:42.784 --> 00:08:44.806
from poor countries.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.226
In virtually every case of corruption
that we've investigated,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.438
shell companies have appeared,

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.798
and sometimes
it's been impossible to find out

00:08:52.822 --> 00:08:56.310
who is really involved in the deal.

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:58.638
A recent study by the World Bank

00:08:58.662 --> 00:09:01.588
looked at 200 cases of corruption.

00:09:01.612 --> 00:09:04.678
It found that over 70
percent of those cases

00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:07.632
had used anonymous shell companies,

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:11.014
totaling almost 56 billion dollars.

00:09:11.038 --> 00:09:13.276
Now many of these
companies were in America

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.586
or the United Kingdom,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.987
its overseas territories
and Crown dependencies,

00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.241
and so it's not just an offshore problem,

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.533
it's an on-shore one too.

00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:23.672
You see, shell companies, they're central

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.926
to the secret deals which may
benefit wealthy elites

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.950
rather than ordinary citizens.

00:09:29.974 --> 00:09:33.196
One striking recent case
that we've investigated

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.172
is how the government
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:40.529
sold off a series of valuable,
state-owned mining assets

00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:43.883
to shell companies
in the British Virgin Islands.

00:09:43.907 --> 00:09:46.155
So we spoke to sources in country,

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:49.191
trawled through company
documents and other information

00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:53.246
trying to piece together a really
true picture of the deal.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.071
And we were alarmed to find
that these shell companies

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.587
had quickly flipped many of the assets on

00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:02.808
for huge profits to major
international mining companies

00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:05.171
listed in London.

00:10:05.195 --> 00:10:08.427
Now, the Africa Progress
Panel, led by Kofi Annan,

00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:11.315
they've calculated
that Congo may have lost

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:16.419
more than 1.3 billion dollars
from these deals.

00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:18.672
That's almost twice

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:24.312
the country's annual health
and education budget combined.

00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:26.938
And will the people of Congo,
will they ever get their money back?

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:28.596
Well, the answer to that question,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.490
and who was really involved
and what really happened,

00:10:30.514 --> 00:10:32.993
well that's going to probably
remain locked away

00:10:33.017 --> 00:10:36.142
in the secretive company registries
of the British Virgin Islands

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:40.976
and elsewhere unless we all do
something about it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.963
And how about the oil, gas
and mining companies?

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.677
Okay, maybe it's a bit
of a cliché to talk about them.

00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:48.797
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.

00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:53.230
There's corruption everywhere,
so why focus on that sector?

00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.430
Well, because there's a lot at stake.

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:59.527
In 2011, natural resource exports

00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:03.039
outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:07.462
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nineteen to one.

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:11.099
Now that's a hell of a lot
of schools and universities

00:11:11.123 --> 00:11:13.076
and hospitals and business startups,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.434
many of which haven't
materialized and never will

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:19.765
because some of that money
has simply been stolen away.

00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:22.170
Now let's go back to the oil
and mining companies,

00:11:22.194 --> 00:11:25.186
and let's go back to Dan Etete
and that $1 billion deal.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.475
And now forgive me, I'm
going to read the next bit

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:30.772
because it's a very live
issue, and our lawyers

00:11:30.796 --> 00:11:32.962
have been through this in some detail

00:11:32.986 --> 00:11:36.272
and they want me to get it right.

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:40.445
Now, on the surface, the deal
appeared straightforward.

00:11:40.469 --> 00:11:42.545
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:45.519
paid the Nigerian
government for the block.

00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:47.682
The Nigerian government transferred

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.506
precisely the same amount,
to the very dollar,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.121
to an account earmarked
for a shell company

00:11:55.145 --> 00:11:57.247
whose hidden owner was Etete.

00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:00.636
Now, that's not bad going
for a convicted money launderer.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.093
And here's the thing.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.970
After many months of digging around

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:07.505
and reading through hundreds
of pages of court documents,

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.460
we found evidence that, in fact,

00:12:09.484 --> 00:12:12.889
Shell and Eni had known that the funds

00:12:12.913 --> 00:12:15.964
would be transferred
to that shell company,

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:19.671
and frankly, it's hard
to believe they didn't know

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:22.962
who they were really dealing with there.

00:12:22.986 --> 00:12:26.050
Now, it just shouldn't take
these sorts of efforts

00:12:26.074 --> 00:12:28.579
to find out where the money
in deals like this went.

00:12:28.603 --> 00:12:30.148
I mean, these are state assets.

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:31.614
They're supposed to be
used for the benefit

00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:33.347
of the people in the country.

00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:36.536
But in some countries,
citizens and journalists

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560
who are trying to expose stories like this

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:40.061
have been harassed and arrested

00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:44.516
and some have even risked
their lives to do so.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.320
And finally, well, there
are those who believe

00:12:48.344 --> 00:12:50.644
that corruption is unavoidable.

00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:52.793
It's just how some business is done.

00:12:52.817 --> 00:12:55.358
It's too complex and difficult to change.

00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:58.285
So in effect, what? We just accept it.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.678
But as a campaigner and investigator,

00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:01.729
I have a different view,

00:13:01.753 --> 00:13:03.899
because I've seen what can happen

00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:06.453
when an idea gains momentum.

00:13:06.477 --> 00:13:09.197
In the oil and mining sector, for example,

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.460
there is now the beginning

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:13.709
of a truly worldwide transparency standard

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:16.729
that could tackle some of these problems.

00:13:16.753 --> 00:13:19.151
In 1999, when Global Witness called

00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:22.490
for oil companies to make
payments on deals transparent,

00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:26.279
well, some people laughed
at the extreme naiveté

00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:28.382
of that small idea.

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:31.952
But literally hundreds
of civil society groups

00:13:31.976 --> 00:13:33.830
from around the world came together

00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:35.439
to fight for transparency,

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:39.420
and now it's fast becoming
the norm and the law.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.392
Two thirds of the value

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.712
of the world's oil and mining companies

00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:47.483
are now covered by transparency laws.
Two thirds.

00:13:47.507 --> 00:13:48.956
So this is change happening.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.846
This is progress.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.969
But we're not there yet, by far.

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:56.215
Because it really isn't about corruption

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:58.330
somewhere over there, is it?

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.535
In a globalized world, corruption

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:02.798
is a truly globalized business,

00:14:02.822 --> 00:14:04.913
and one that needs global solutions,

00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:08.913
supported and pushed by us
all, as global citizens,

00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:10.075
right here.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.265
Thank you.

00:14:11.289 --> 00:14:18.105
(Applause)
