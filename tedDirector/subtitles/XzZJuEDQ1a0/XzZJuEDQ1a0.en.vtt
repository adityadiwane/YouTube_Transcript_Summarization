00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:16.432
My first love was for the night sky.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:17.998
Love is complicated.

00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:22.527
You're looking at a fly-through of the 
Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:26.639
one of the most distant images
of our universe ever observed.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:29.153
Everything you see here is a galaxy,

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:32.160
comprised of billions of stars each.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.901
And the farthest galaxy is 
a trillion, trillion kilometers away.

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.805
As an astrophysicist, I have
the awesome privilege of studying

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.252
some of the most exotic objects 
in our universe.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:48.064
The objects that have captivated me 
from first crush throughout my career

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:52.473
are supermassive, 
hyperactive black holes.

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:57.931
Weighing one to 10 billion times 
the mass of our own sun,

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.825
these galactic black holes 
are devouring material,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.145
at a rate of upwards of 
1,000 times more

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.512
than your "average" 
supermassive black hole.

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:09.640
(Laughter)

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.334
These two characteristics,

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:14.548
with a few others, make them quasars.

00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:17.465
At the same time, the objects I study

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.242
are producing some of the most
powerful particle streams

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:21.937
ever observed.

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.777
These narrow streams, called jets,

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:29.385
are moving at 99.99 percent 
of the speed of light,

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:33.368
and are pointed directly at the Earth.

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:39.257
These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive
and supermassive black holes

00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:43.801
are called blazars, or blazing quasars.

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.282
What makes blazars so special
is that they're some of the universe's

00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:49.802
most efficient particle accelerators,

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:54.720
transporting incredible amounts
of energy throughout a galaxy.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469
Here, I'm showing an
artist's conception of a blazar.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.669
The dinner plate by which 
material falls onto the black hole

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:02.256
is called the accretion disc,

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:04.082
shown here in blue.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.061
Some of that material is slingshotted
around the black hole

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.085
and accelerated to insanely high speeds

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:11.912
in the jet, shown here in white.

00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:14.599
Although the blazar system is rare,

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.606
the process by which nature
pulls in material via a disk,

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:20.883
and then flings some of it out via a jet,
is more common.

00:02:21.647 --> 00:02:24.091
We'll eventually zoom out of 
the blazar system

00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:29.180
to show its approximate relationship
to the larger galactic context.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.295
Beyond the cosmic accounting
of what goes in to what goes out,

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.342
one of the hot topics in 
blazar astrophysics right now

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:45.053
is where the highest-energy 
jet emission comes from.

00:02:45.053 --> 00:02:48.974
In this image, I'm interested
in where this white blob forms

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.617
and if, as a result, there's any 
relationship between the jet

00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:55.483
and the accretion disc material.

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:57.286
Clear answers to this question

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:00.401
were almost completely
inaccessible until 2008,

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.675
when NASA launched a new telescope
that better detects gamma ray light --

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.387
that is, light with energies
a million times higher

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.934
than your standard x-ray scan.

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:14.824
I simultaneously compare variations
between the gamma ray light data

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:18.493
and the visible light data from
day to day and year to year,

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:21.767
to better localize these gamma ray blobs.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.453
My research shows that in some instances,

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:27.513
these blobs form much closer
to the black hole

00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:29.873
than we initially thought.

00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:31.764
As we more confidently localize

00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:34.060
where these gamma ray 
blobs are forming,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.583
we can better understand how jets
are being accelerated,

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.191
and ultimately reveal 
the dynamic processes

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:44.886
by which some of the most fascinating
objects in our universe are formed.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.501
This all started as a love story.

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.414
And it still is.

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:55.624
This love transformed me from 
a curious, stargazing young girl

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:57.445
to a professional astrophysicist,

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.782
hot on the heels of celestial discovery.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.202
Who knew that chasing after the universe

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:07.000
would ground me so deeply
to my mission here on Earth.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.468
Then again, when do we ever know
where love's first flutter

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:11.942
will truly take us.

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:13.171
Thank you.

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.471
(Applause)
