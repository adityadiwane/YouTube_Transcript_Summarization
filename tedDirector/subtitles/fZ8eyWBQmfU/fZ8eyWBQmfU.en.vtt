00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
So magic is a very introverted field.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
While scientists regularly publish their latest research,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
That's true even amongst peers.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
then how could a cyber illusionist like myself

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
share his research?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And about three years ago,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I started an exercise

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in openness and inclusiveness

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.260
by reaching out into the open-source software community

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
to create new digital tools for magic --

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
to start them off further on in the process

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and to get them to the poetry faster.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
It's an augmented reality

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
projection tracking and mapping system,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
or a digital storytelling tool.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
So let's give this a try.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And I'm going to use it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to give you my take

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
on the stuff of life.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
(Applause)

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:48.260
(Music)

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Wake up.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Hey.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Come on.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:22.260
(Music)

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Please.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:42.260
(Music)

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Come on.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Ah, sorry about that.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Forgot this.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:59.260
(Music)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Give it another try.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
He figured out the system.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.260
(Music)

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
(Laughter)

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
(Applause)

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.260
(Music)

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Uh oh.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:44.260
(Music)

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
All right. Let's try this.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Come on.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:12.260
(Music)

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
(Laughter)

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Music)

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Hey.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:05:16.260
(Music)

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
You heard her, go ahead.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
(Laughter)

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
(Applause)

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Bye-bye.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:38.260
(Applause)
