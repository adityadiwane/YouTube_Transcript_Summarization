00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
political cartoonist.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
It's a sort of paper-based reader.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
(Laughter)

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It's lighter than an iPad,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
it's a bit cheaper.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
You know what they say?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
They say the print media is dying --

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
who says that? Well, the media.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
But this is no news, right?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
You've read about it already.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
(Laughter)

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the world has gotten smaller.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
I know it's a cliche, but look,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
look how small,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
how tiny it has gotten.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
And you know the reason why, of course.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
This is because of technology -- yeah.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
(Laughter)

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Any computer designers in the room?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Yeah well,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
you guys are making my life miserable

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
because track pads used to be round,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
a nice round shape.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
That makes a good cartoon.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
those square things?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Well, I know the world is flat now.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.260
That's true.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And the Internet has reached

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
every corner of the world,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
the poorest, the remotest places.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.260
(Laughter)

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So we are bridging the digital divide.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
The Third World is connected,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
we are connected.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And what happens next?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Well, you've got mail.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Yeah.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Well, the Internet has empowered us.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
It has empowered you,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
it has empowered me

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and it has empowered some other guys as well.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.260
(Laughter)

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You know, these last two cartoons --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
I did them live

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
during a conference in Hanoi.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And they were not used to that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
in communist 2.0 Vietnam.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
(Laughter)

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
it was quite a sensation --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and then this guy came to me.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And as he came the second day,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And on the third day, I finally understood,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
the guy was actually on duty.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
smiling with my sketches

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
in the files of the Vietnamese police.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
(Laughter)

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
It has rocked the music industry;

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
it has changed the way we consume music.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
For those of you old enough to remember,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
we used to have to go to the store

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
to steal it.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
(Laughter)

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And it has changed the way

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
your future employer

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
will look at your application.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So be careful

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
with that Facebook account --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
your momma told you, be careful.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And technology has set us free --

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
this is free WiFi.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
But yeah, it has liberated us

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
from the office desk.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
This is your life,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
enjoy it.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
(Laughter)

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
In short, technology, the internet,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
they have changed our lifestyle.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Tech guru, like this man --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
they are shaping the way we do things.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
They are shaping the way we consume.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
They are shaping our very desires.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.260
(Laughter)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.260
(Applause)

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
You will not like it.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And technology has even changed

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
our relationship to God.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.260
(Laughter)

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Now I shouldn't get into this.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Religion and political cartoons,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
as you may have heard,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
make a difficult couple,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
ever since that day of 2005,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
demonstrations, fatwa,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
they provoked violence. People died in the violence.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
This was so sickening;

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
people died because of cartoons.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I mean --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
I had the feeling at the time

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
They were used first by a Danish newspaper,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
which wanted to make a point on Islam.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
who received the assignment to draw the prophet --

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
12 of them refused. Did you know that?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
This is not how it works."

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And then, of course, they were used

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
by extremists and politicians on the other side.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
They wanted to stir up controversy.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
You know the story.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
History tells us,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
they've been used by the Nazis

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to attack the Jews.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And here we are now.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
In the United Nations,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
half of the world is pushing

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to penalize the offense to religion --

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
they call it the defamation of religion --

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
while the other half of the world is fighting back

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
in defense of freedom of speech.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So the clash of civilizations is here,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and cartoons are at the middle of it?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
This got me thinking.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Now you see me thinking

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
at my kitchen table,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and since you're in my kitchen,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
please meet my wife.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.260
(Laughter)

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
In 2006, a few months after,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
I went Ivory Coast --

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Western Africa.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
You had a rebellion in the North,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
and in the middle, the French army.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
This looks like a giant hamburger.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
You don't want to be the ham in the middle.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I was there to report on that story

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
in cartoons.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
I've been doing this for the last 15 years;

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
it's my side job, if you want.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
So you see the style is different.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
I went to places like Gaza

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
during the war in 2009.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So this is really journalism in cartoons.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You'll hear more and more about it.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
This is the future of journalism, I think.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
There was an ethnic side to this conflict

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
as very often in Africa.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
And I went to see the Dozo.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of West Africa.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
People fear them --

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
they help the rebellion a lot.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
They are believed to have magical powers.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
They can disappear and escape bullets.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
I went to see a Dozo chief;

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
he told me about his magical powers.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
He said, "I can chop your head off right away

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and bring you back to life."

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
(Laughter)

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
"Another time."

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
So back in Abidjan,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
I was given a chance to lead a workshop

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
with local cartoonists there

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and I thought, yes,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
against the other side.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
it was compared to the media in Rwanda

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
before the genocide --

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
so imagine.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And what can a cartoonist do?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
to draw what they wanted to see,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and the guy has to feed his family, right?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
So the idea was pretty simple.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
We brought together cartoonists

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
from all sides in Ivory Coast.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And I asked them to do a project together,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
tackle the issues affecting their country

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Show the positive power of cartoons.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
It's a great tool of communication

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
for bad or for good.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
And cartoons can cross boundaries,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
as you have seen.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
And humor is a good way, I think,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to address serious issues.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
And I'm very proud of what they did.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
The first day, they were even shouting at each other.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
But they came up with a book,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
looking back at 13 years

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
of political crisis in Ivory Coast.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So the idea was there.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And I've been doing projects like this,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
in 2009 in Lebanon,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
this year in Kenya, back in January.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
In Lebanon, it was not a book.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
The idea was to have --

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
the same principal, a divided country --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
take cartoonists from all sides

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and let them do something together.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So in Lebanon,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
we enrolled the newspaper editors,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and we got them to publish

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
like religion in politics and everyday life.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And it worked.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
published all those cartoonists together --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
anti-government,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
pro-government,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Christian,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Muslim, of course,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
English-speaking, well, you name it.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
So this was a great project.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And then in Kenya, what we did

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
was addressing the issue of ethnicity,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
And we did video clips --

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
So, preaching for freedom of speech

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
is easy here,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
but as you have seen

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
in contexts of repression or division,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
again, what can a cartoonist do?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
He has to keep his job.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Well I believe that in any context anywhere,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
he always has the choice at least

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
not to do a cartoon

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that will feed hatred.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
And that's the message I try to convey to them.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
I think we all always have the choice in the end

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
not to do the bad thing.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
But we need to support

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
these [unclear], critical

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
and responsible voices

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
in Africa, in Lebanon,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
in your local newspaper,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
in the Apple store.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Today, tech companies

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
are the world's largest editors.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
They decide what is too offensive

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
or too provocative for you to see.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
it's about your freedoms.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
And for dictators all over the world,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
the good news

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
is when cartoonists,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
journalists and activists shut up.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Thank you.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.260
(Applause)
