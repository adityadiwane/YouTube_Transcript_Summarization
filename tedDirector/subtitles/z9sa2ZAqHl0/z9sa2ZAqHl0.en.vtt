00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
because I have no form

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of PowerPoint presentation.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
So what I'm going to do

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
is, every now and again, I will make this gesture,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.260
you can imagine what you'd like to see.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I do a radio show.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
It's about science, it's about rationalism.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So therefore, we get a lot of complaints

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
every single week --

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
complaints including one we get very often,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
celebrates the idea of vivisection.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
We have made it quite clear to these people

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
that an infinite monkey cage is roomy.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
(Laughter)

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
We also had someone else who said,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
An infinite number of monkeys

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
could never write the works of Shakespeare.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
We know this because they did an experiment."

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
(Laughter)

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So the main element though, the main complaint we get --

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and one that I find most worrying --

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
on ruining the magic?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
You bring in science, and it ruins the magic."

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Now I'm an arts graduate;

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I love myth and magic

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
and existentialism and self-loathing.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
That's what I do.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But I also don't understand

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
how it does ruin the magic.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
All of the magic, I think,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that may well be taken away by science

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
is then replaced by something as wonderful.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Astrology, for instance:

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
(Laughter)

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Now astrology --

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
we remove the banal idea

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
that your life could be predicted;

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
who's wearing a hat.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
That is gone.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
We can see predictions of galaxies forming,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
This is a wonderful thing.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
one day it would say,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
"Not a good day for making plans.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
You'll been engulfed by a red giant."

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And that to me as well,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
well Many Worlds theory --

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
one of the most beautiful, fascinating,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
sometimes terrifying ideas

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
from the quantum interpretation --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is a wonderful thing.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
That every person here, every decision that you've made today,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
every decision you've made in your life,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
you've not really made that decision,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
is made, each one going off into a new universe.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
That is a wonderful idea.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.260
If you ever think that your life is rubbish,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
always remember

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
(Laughter)

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
don't end it all.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Remember that in the majority of universes,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
you don't even exist in the first place.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
This to me, in its own strange way,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is very, very comforting.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
But it's not gone.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Science actually says

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
we will live forever.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Well, there is one proviso.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that gets this one go.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
But every single thing that makes us,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
every atom in us,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
has already created a myriad of different things

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and will go on to create a myriad of new things.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
We have been mountains

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and apples and pulsars

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and other people's knees.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
That is a good thing.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Unlike the occupants of the universe,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
the universe itself is not wasteful.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
We are all totally recyclable.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And when we die,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
This is a wonderful thing.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Understanding, to me,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.260
does not remove the wonder and the joy.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
"Why do you love me?"

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And I can with all honesty

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
look her in the eye and say,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
"Because our pheromones

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
matched our olfactory receptors."

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
(Laughter)

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Though I'll probably also say something

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
about her hair and personality as well.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And that is a wonderful thing there.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Love does not die because of that thing.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Pain doesn't go away either.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
If someone punches me --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
and because of my personality,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
this is recently a regular occurrence --

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I understand where the pain comes from.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It is basically momentum to energy

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
where the four-vector is constant -- that's what it is.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
But at no point can I react and go,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.260
"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
No, I just spit out a tooth.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Laughter)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I have a son. His name is Archie.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I'm very lucky,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
because he's better than all the other children.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
Now I know you don't think that.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
You may well have your own children

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and think, "Oh no, my child's best."

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
That's the wonderful thing about evolution --

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
the predilection to believe

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
that our child is best.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and therefore we love it.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
That is a wonderful thing.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Though I should say that my son is best

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and is better than your children.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
I've done some tests.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And all of these things to me

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
give such joy and excitement and wonder.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
for bad housework, for instance.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
You house is in a terrible state.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Your partner is about to return.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
You think, what should I do?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Do nothing.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
All you have to do

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
say, "I'm so sorry.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
I stopped observing the house for a moment,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and when I started observing again,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
everything had happened."

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
(Laughter)

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
For me, it's a very, very important thing.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Even on my journey up here --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
I'm sitting on a train.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Every time I breathe in,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I'm breathing in a million-billion-billion

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
atoms of oxygen.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
I'm sitting on a chair.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Even though I know the chair is made of atoms

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and therefore actually in many ways empty space,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
I find it comfortable.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I look out the window, and I realize

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that every single time we stop and I look out that window,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
framed in that window,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
wherever we are,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
I am observing more life

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
than there is in the rest of the known universe

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
beyond the planet Earth.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
If you go to the safari parks

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
on Saturn or Jupiter,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
you will be disappointed.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And I realize I'm observing this

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
with the brain, the human brain,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
the most complex thing in the known universe.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
That, to me, is an incredible thing.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And do you know what, that might be enough.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
"The more the universe seems comprehensible,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
the more it seems pointless."

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Now for some people,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
I'm glad the universe is pointless.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
It means if I get to the end of my life,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
That's not the point."

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
I can make my own purpose.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
You can make your own purpose.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
We have the individual power

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
to go, "This is what I want to do."

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
And in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
I have chosen to make silly jokes

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
