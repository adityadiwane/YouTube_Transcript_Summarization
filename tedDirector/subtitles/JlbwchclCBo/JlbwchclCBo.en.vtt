00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.771
Joseph Keller used to jog
around the Stanford campus,

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:21.512
and he was struck by all the women
jogging there as well.

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:25.125
Why did their ponytails swing
from side to side like that?

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.825
Being a mathematician,
he set out to understand why.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.330
Professor Keller was curious
about many things:

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.321
why teapots dribble

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:36.175
or how earthworms wriggle.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.715
Until a few months ago,
I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.253
I read about him in the New York Times,

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:44.709
in the obituaries.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:48.505
The Times had half a page
of editorial dedicated to him,

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:52.451
which you can imagine is premium space
for a newspaper of their stature.

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:55.530
I read the obituaries almost every day.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.532
My wife understandably thinks
I'm rather morbid

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.956
to begin my day with scrambled eggs
and a "Let's see who died today."

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.130
(Laughter)

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:07.137
But if you think about it,

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.574
the front page of the newspaper
is usually bad news,

00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:12.573
and cues man's failures.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:15.263
An instance where bad news
cues accomplishment

00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:18.522
is at the end of the paper,
in the obituaries.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.589
In my day job,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.089
I run a company that focuses
on future insights

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.533
that marketers can derive
from past data --

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:28.501
a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.067
And we began to think:

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:35.209
What if we held a rearview mirror
to obituaries from the New York Times?

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:39.802
Were there lessons on how you could get
your obituary featured --

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.803
even if you aren't around to enjoy it?

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:43.311
(Laughter)

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.963
Would this go better with scrambled eggs?

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:47.137
(Laughter)

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:50.981
And so, we looked at the data.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.183
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries

00:01:56.207 --> 00:01:59.849
over a 20-month period
between 2015 and 2016.

00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:04.697
What did these 2,000 deaths --
rather, lives -- teach us?

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.754
Well, first we looked at words.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.539
This here is an obituary headline.

00:02:08.563 --> 00:02:10.859
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:13.405
If you remove the beginning and the end,

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.763
you're left with a beautifully
worded descriptor

00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:21.462
that tries to, in just a few words,
capture an achievement or a lifetime.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.647
Just looking at these is fascinating.

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.416
Here are a few famous ones,
people who died in the last two years.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.759
Try and guess who they are.

00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:30.223
[An Artist who Defied Genre]

00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:31.432
That's Prince.

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.154
[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:35.338
Oh, yes.

00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:36.586
[Muhammad Ali]

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.156
[Groundbreaking Architect]

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.431
Zaha Hadid.

00:02:40.663 --> 00:02:42.411
So we took these descriptors

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.959
and did what's called
natural language processing,

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:46.754
where you feed these into a program,

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:48.643
it throws out the superfluous words --

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.890
"the," "and," -- the kind of words
you can mime easily in "Charades," --

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:55.107
and leaves you with the most
significant words.

00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:56.952
And we did it not just for these four,

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.495
but for all 2,000 descriptors.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.262
And this is what it looks like.

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:07.651
Film, theatre, music, dance
and of course, art, are huge.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.251
Over 40 percent.

00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:12.803
You have to wonder
why in so many societies

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:17.262
we insist that our kids pursue
engineering or medicine or business or law

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:18.873
to be construed as successful.

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.384
And while we're talking profession,

00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:22.559
let's look at age --

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:25.093
the average age at which
they achieved things.

00:03:25.117 --> 00:03:26.963
That number is 37.

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:31.750
What that means is,
you've got to wait 37 years ...

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.169
before your first significant achievement
that you're remembered for --

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:36.344
on average --

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:38.846
44 years later, when you
die at the age of 81 --

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.038
on average.

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:41.063
(Laughter)

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.771
Talk about having to be patient.

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:43.852
(Laughter)

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:45.965
Of course, it varies by profession.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:47.579
If you're a sports star,

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:49.730
you'll probably hit
your stride in your 20s.

00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:52.399
And if you're in your 40s like me,

00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:54.414
you can join the fun world of politics.

00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:55.494
(Laughter)

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:59.433
Politicians do their first and sometimes
only commendable act in their mid-40s.

00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:00.714
(Laughter)

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:02.675
If you're wondering what "others" are,

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.175
here are some examples.

00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:06.757
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.663
and the things they're remembered for?

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:10.439
(Laughter)

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:13.800
Our curiosity was in overdrive,

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:17.612
and we desired to analyze
more than just a descriptor.

00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:23.764
So, we ingested the entire
first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,

00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:26.562
but we did this separately
for two groups of people:

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:29.363
people that are famous
and people that are not famous.

00:04:29.387 --> 00:04:32.076
Famous people -- Prince,
Ali, Zaha Hadid --

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.335
people who are not famous
are people like Jocelyn Cooper,

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.513
Reverend Curry

00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:38.706
or Lorna Kelly.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.918
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
of most of their names.

00:04:41.942 --> 00:04:45.754
Amazing people, fantastic achievements,
but they're not famous.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.328
So what if we analyze
these two groups separately --

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:50.877
the famous and the non-famous?

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:52.320
What might that tell us?

00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:53.584
Take a look.

00:04:56.376 --> 00:04:57.845
Two things leap out at me.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.559
First:

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.124
"John."

00:05:01.148 --> 00:05:02.448
(Laughter)

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:07.122
Anyone here named John
should thank your parents --

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:08.475
(Laughter)

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.581
and remind your kids to cut out
your obituary when you're gone.

00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.237
And second:

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:16.823
"help."

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:21.809
We uncovered, many lessons
from lives well-led,

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.669
and what those people immortalized
in print could teach us.

00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:29.431
The exercise was a fascinating testament
to the kaleidoscope that is life,

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:32.170
and even more fascinating

00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:35.262
was the fact that the overwhelming
majority of obituaries

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:38.284
featured people famous and non-famous,

00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:40.741
who did seemingly extraordinary things.

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.504
They made a positive dent
in the fabric of life.

00:05:44.528 --> 00:05:45.765
They helped.

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:49.183
So ask yourselves as you go
back to your daily lives:

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:52.127
How am I using my talents to help society?

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.124
Because the most powerful lesson here is,

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:59.484
if more people lived their lives
trying to be famous in death,

00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:02.113
the world would be a much better place.

00:06:02.882 --> 00:06:04.051
Thank you.

00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:06.923
(Applause)
