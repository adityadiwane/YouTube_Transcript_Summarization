00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I don't sleep that much,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330
as being a great virtue, after years of kind of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
battling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
But for years I've been sitting up

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.330
I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Sometimes I used to walk more at night.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
(Laughter)

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And sometimes -- actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
And so I was following this guy.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
And I took a picture of his shoes,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
and we thanked each other and just went on our way.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.330
But I do that all the time.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.330
As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
so many clothes out there.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
And the only ones that look interesting to me

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.330
are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
or very, very surprising.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
And often, I'm driving in a taxi

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
and I see a hole in a shirt, or something

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
that looks very interesting or pretty or functional

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.330
in some way that I'd never seen happen before.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
it was a shadow, you know.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
there was actually someone thought of that thought already.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
I don't know where inspiration comes from.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
It does not come for me from research.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
I don't get necessarily inspired by research.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330
I've ever, ever done in my whole life,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.330
was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.330
I read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.330
And I saw this really smart critic who I love.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and she came backstage and she said,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
And I said, how do I know about Stalinism?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
So I don't really know that. I don't really --

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
actually I do my own kind of research, you know.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330
If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
not because it's what I'm supposed to do.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330
light from behind the projection,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.330
or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
I sit up at night and I watch movies

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
and I watch women in movies a lot.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
And I think about, you know, their roles,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
Whether they're kind of glorified in this way,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.330
or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
I go back to color all the time.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Color is something that motivates me a lot.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.330
It's rarely color that I find in nature,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.330
although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
natural color is so beautiful.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
So that's what I do. I study color a lot.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.330
But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
I mean, that's just not possible, you know.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
I want to show you -- I'm also like a big --

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.330
I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
and that's another thing that motivates me a lot.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.330
So I do it.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.330
(Laughter)

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.330
When I was about 21, an astrologer told me

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
that I was going to meet the man of my dreams,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
and that his name was going to be Eric, right?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
So, you know, for years I would go to bars

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
I was humping immediately, or something.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
(Laughter)

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.330
And there were times when I was actually so desperate

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
(Laughter)

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.330
And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.330
and you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
where I do a cabaret act.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
So actually, check this out.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Very embarrassing.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.330
(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.330
The name of the show is based on this story

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.330
that I have to tell you about my mother.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.330
I was dating this guy, right?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.330
And this has to do with being happy, I swear.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.330
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.330
And we were getting serious,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.330
And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.330
who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
You know, homosexuality, right?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
They eat out, they see shows."

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
They eat out, they see shows.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
(Laughter)

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.330
That's the name of the show, they eat out, they --

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
that's on my tombstone when I die.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
"He ate out, he saw shows," right?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.330
to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.330
I don't know how to put this.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.330
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
And at least, you know, in my case,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
because if I just do one thing all the time,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.330
I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.330
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.330
And I kind of try not to look back, you know.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.330
Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.330
But I guess that's okay. Right?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Because if you do many things

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
you get to feel lousy about everything,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
and not just one, you know.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.330
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
I will show you this next thing,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.330
speaking of costumes for operas.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
I do work with different choreographers.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
and I work with Mark Morris a lot,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.330
who is one of my best friends.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.330
And I designed three operas with him,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
and the most recent one, "King Arthur."

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
I'd been very ingrained in the dance world

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.330
since I was a teenager.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
I went to performing arts high school,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.330
where I was an actor.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
And many of my friends were ballet dancers.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
I don't know where it comes from.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
I started making puppets when I was a kid.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.330
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
And then performing arts high school.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
There I was in high school,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
meeting dancers and acting.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.330
And somehow, from there, I got interested in design.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
I went to Parsons School of Design

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
and then I began my career as a designer.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
I don't really think of myself as a designer,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.330
I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.330
It's just that.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.330
(Laughter)

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
You always have to be slightly bored with everything.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.330
And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
(Laughter)

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
But I am really a little bored with everything.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.330
I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything --

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
she books everything and she makes everything happen.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.330
And she makes all the deals.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
And I always tell her that I find myself

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
with a lot of time on the computer bridge program.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
so ... somehow, like, about ten years ago

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
I thought that the most unboring place in the world

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
would be like a T.V. studio,

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.330
Because it's all of these things that I love

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.330
all kind of in one place.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.330
and do another thing and talk about it, right?

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
And so I had this T.V. show.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
Actually, could you roll the clip, please?

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Hi there.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.330
Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.330
IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
Man: Her grandmother says, "Delish!"

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.330
IM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.330
I want to stay out of the way.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
I don't want to be -- okay. Here we go.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
Do you get nervous, Ashleigh?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.330
Ashleigh: Doing what?

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.330
ROD: Cutting hair.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.330
A: Cutting hair? Never, never.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330
IM: You look so cute already, by the way.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.330
ROD: You like it? All right.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.330
IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
ROD: Of course I want to look cute.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.330
IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.330
aggressively ugly.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.330
ROD: No, not me, no.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.330
IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
really messed up, you know what I mean?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.330
And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.330
Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
does that mean you shouldn't have kids,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.330
because you know they're going to end up getting messed up?

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.330
their well-being first, I think.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
But you have to make the decision for yourself.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
My kids are seven, who the hell knows.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And they're going to be playing this clip:

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
"I'm such a good mother."

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
My God, this is the shortest I've ever had.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.330
IM: It looks good, yeah?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.330
A: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been --

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
ROD: No! It's all right -- go crazy.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.330
A: Oh no, we're just staging,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.330
ROD: We're just staging it.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.330
IM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
ROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.330
IM: Oh, it's so fabulous!

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
ROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.330
I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.330
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.330
"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
Right? And then I realized, that was on my website,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.330
I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.330
I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.330
I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
And I often look at things as though they're food.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.330
How could you show a beat up old dress?

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.330
I always relate things to kitchen-ry.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
And so I think that's what it all boils down to.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.330
Everything boils down to that.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.330
So check this out.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.330
This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.330
It's, like, this website.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
It's got a lot of different things on it.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.330
It's a polymathematical website.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.330
We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And here is the last bit.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.330
(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.330
Chef: Do you?

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.330
Chef: Oh.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.330
Chef: You can't?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.330
IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Chef: No, but that's all it is.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.330
IM: Is that all it is?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
Chef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.330
Let me tell you something interesting.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.330
IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.330
Just because I don't know that whole -- that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.330
Sorry, what?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.330
Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
In the old days when they used to make butter,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.330
you know how you make butter?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.330
IM: Churns?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.330
Chef: For cream?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.330
IM: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.330
Chef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.330
and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
The liquid is actually that clear liquid.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.330
If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
it's actually buttermilk.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.330
And that's what it was in the early days.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.330
Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.330
Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.330
IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
So who would think that it was low-fat?

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Well, that's it. Thank you very much.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.330
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.330
Thanks. Bye.
