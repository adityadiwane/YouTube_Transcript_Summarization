00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I just came back from a community

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
that holds the secret to human survival.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
It's a place where women run the show,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
have sex to say hello,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and play rules the day --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
where fun is serious business.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
And no, this isn't Burning Man

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
or San Francisco.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
(Laughter)

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
This is the world of wild bonobos

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in the jungles of Congo.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
your living closest relative.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
That means we all share a common ancestor,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
an evolutionary grandmother,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
who lived around six million years ago.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Now, chimpanzees are well-known

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
for their aggression.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
(Laughter)

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But unfortunately,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
we have made too much of an emphasis

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
of this aspect

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
in our narratives of human evolution.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
But bonobos show us

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
the other side of the coin.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
While chimpanzees

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
are dominated by big, scary guys,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
bonobo society

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
is run by empowered females.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
These guys have really worked something out,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
since this leads to a highly tolerant society

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
where fatal violence

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
has not been observed yet.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But unfortunately,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
bonobos are the least understood

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
of the great apes.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and it has been very difficult to study them.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
The Congo is a paradox --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
but also the heart of darkness itself --

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
the scene of a violent conflict

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
that has raged for decades

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
and claimed nearly as many lives

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
as the First World War.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Not surprisingly,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.260
this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Bushmeat trades and forest loss

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
means we couldn't fill a small stadium

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
with all the bonobos that are left in the world --

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and we're not even sure of that to be honest.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
you can hear hidden laughter

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
swaying the trees.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Who are these cousins?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.260
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
since they have frequent, promiscuous

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and bisexual sex

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
to manage conflict

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and solve social issues.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
to all of humanity's problems --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
since there's more to bonobo life

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
than the Kama Sutra.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Bonobos, like humans,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
love to play throughout their entire lives.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Play is not just child's games.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
For us and them,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
play is foundational for bonding relationships

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and fostering tolerance.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
It's where we learn to trust

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and where we learn about the rules of the game.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Play increases creativity

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
and resilience,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and it's all about the generation of diversity --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
diversity of interactions,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
diversity of behaviors,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
diversity of connections.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And when you watch bonobo play,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
you're seeing the very evolutionary roots

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
of human laughter, dance

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and ritual.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Play is the glue

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that binds us together.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Now, I don't know how you play,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
but I want to show you a couple of unique clips

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
fresh from the wild.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and I do not mean football.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So here,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
we have a young female and a male

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
engaged in a chase game.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Have a look what she's doing.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
"she's got him by the balls."

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
(Laughter)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Yeah.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
(Laughter)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So sex play is common

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
in both bonobos and humans.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And this video is really interesting

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
because it shows --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
this video's really interesting

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
because it shows the inventiveness

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
of bringing unusual elements into play --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
such as testicles --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
and also how play both requires trust

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and fosters trust --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
while at the same time being tremendous fun.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
But play's a shapeshifter.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
(Laughter)

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Play's a shapeshifter,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
and it can take many forms,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
some of which are more quiet,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
imaginative, curious --

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
maybe where wonder is discovered anew.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And I want you to see,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
this is Fuku, a young female,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and she is quietly playing with water.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I think, like her,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
we sometimes play alone,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and we explore the boundaries

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of our inner and our outer worlds.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
And it's that playful curiosity

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and then the unexpected connections we form

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
are the real hotbed for creativity.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So these are just small tasters

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
into the insights that bonobo give us

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
to our past and present.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
But they also hold a secret for our future,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
a future where we need to adapt

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
to an increasingly challenging world

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
through greater creativity

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and greater cooperation.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
The secret is that play is the key

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
to these capacities.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
In other words,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
play is our adaptive wildcard.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
In order to adapt successfully

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
to a changing world,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
we need to play.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
But will we make the most of our playfulness?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Play is not frivolous.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Play's essential.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
For bonobos and humans alike,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
life is not just red in tooth and claw.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
In times when it seems least appropriate to play,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
it might be the times when it is most urgent.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And so, my fellow primates,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
let us embrace this gift from evolution

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and play together,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
as we rediscover creativity,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
fellowship and wonder.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Thank you.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
(Applause)
