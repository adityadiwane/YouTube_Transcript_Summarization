00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:17.176
Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.829
Now, I think that we can all agree

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:22.162
that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.882
(Laughter)

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:26.873
But it's not just because
of our dashing personalities,

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:31.520
superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases.

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:35.826
It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.326
of how to find the perfect partner.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.029
Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled,

00:00:42.053 --> 00:00:43.916
"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" --

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.347
(Laughter)

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.989
Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love.

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:51.242
Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.518
Of all of the available women in the UK,

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:57.037
all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him,

00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.867
somebody in the right age range,

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.813
somebody with a university degree,

00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:03.819
somebody he's likely to get on well with,

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:05.786
somebody who's likely to be attractive,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.116
somebody who's likely
to find him attractive.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.194
(Laughter)

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:16.008
And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK.

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:17.211
(Laughter)

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:19.268
It's not looking very good, is it Peter?

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.246
Now, just to put that into perspective,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.550
that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates

00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:28.275
of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.593
And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.878
of bumping into any one
of these special ladies

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:37.441
on a given night out.

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.467
I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.949
don't really bother
going on nights out anymore.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.365
The thing is that I personally
don't subscribe

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.045
to such a pessimistic view.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.658
Because I know,
just as well as all of you do,

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:52.054
that love doesn't really work like that.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:56.928
Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
and rational and easily predictable.

00:01:57.396 --> 00:01:59.617
But I also know that that doesn't mean

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.921
that mathematics hasn't got something
that it can offer us,

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:06.691
because, love, as with most of life,
is full of patterns

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:11.141
and mathematics is, ultimately,
all about the study of patterns.

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:15.509
Patterns from predicting the weather
to the fluctuations in the stock market,

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.564
to the movement of the planets
or the growth of cities.

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:20.878
And if we're being honest,
none of those things

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:24.064
are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either.

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:30.144
Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential

00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:33.489
to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything.

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.333
Even something as mysterious as love.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.651
And so, to try to persuade you

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:43.368
of how totally amazing, excellent
and relevant mathematics is,

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:50.075
I want to give you my top three
mathematically verifiable tips for love.

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:52.416
(Laughter)

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.080
OK, so Top Tip #1:

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.221
How to win at online dating.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:01.938
So my favorite online dating
website is OkCupid,

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.550
not least because it was started
by a group of mathematicians.

00:03:05.574 --> 00:03:07.319
Now, because they're mathematicians,

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:08.820
they have been collecting data

00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:12.340
on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade.

00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:14.514
And they've been trying
to search for patterns

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:16.401
in the way that we talk about ourselves

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.484
and the way that we interact
with each other

00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:19.852
on an online dating website.

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.801
And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings.

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:24.423
But my particular favorite

00:03:24.447 --> 00:03:27.803
is that it turns out
that on an online dating website,

00:03:27.827 --> 00:03:33.487
how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are,

00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.367
and actually, having people
think that you're ugly

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.286
can work to your advantage.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.619
(Laughter)

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:42.313
Let me show you how this works.

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:46.716
In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.541
you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are

00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:51.850
on a scale between one and five.

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:54.855
Now, if we compare this score,
the average score,

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.020
to how many messages
a selection of people receive,

00:03:58.044 --> 00:03:59.567
you can begin to get a sense

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.999
of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website.

00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:07.365
This is the graph the OkCupid guys
have come up with.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.383
And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true

00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:13.232
that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get.

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:17.511
But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:21.398
who are so much more popular
than people down here,

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:24.518
even though they have the same
score of attractiveness?

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:28.675
And the reason why is that it's not just
straightforward looks that are important.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.506
So let me try to illustrate
their findings with an example.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.448
So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example,

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:39.952
everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman.

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:43.694
Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either.

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:48.309
If you compare Portia de Rossi
to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:52.015
now, a lot of people,
myself included, I should say,

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.296
think that Sarah Jessica Parker
is seriously fabulous

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.966
and possibly one
of the most beautiful creatures

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.380
to have ever have walked
on the face of the Earth.

00:05:01.404 --> 00:05:06.169
But some other people,
i.e., most of the Internet ...

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:08.263
(Laughter)

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.673
seem to think that she looks
a bit like a horse.

00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:13.486
(Laughter)

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.603
Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:19.535
Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.467
and you ask them to give
them a score between one and five

00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:25.511
I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score.

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:28.299
But the way that people would vote
would be very different.

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:31.025
So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the four

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.480
because everybody agrees
that she's very beautiful,

00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:36.218
whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion.

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:38.218
There'd be a huge spread in her scores.

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:40.591
And actually it's this spread that counts.

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.841
It's this spread
that makes you more popular

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:45.041
on an online Internet dating website.

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:46.253
So what that means then

00:05:46.277 --> 00:05:48.882
is that if some people
think that you're attractive,

00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:50.767
you're actually better off

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:54.738
having some other people
think that you're a massive minger.

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:58.149
That's much better
than everybody just thinking

00:05:58.173 --> 00:06:00.236
that you're the cute girl next door.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.585
Now, I think this begins
to make a bit more sense

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:05.879
when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages.

00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.261
So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive,

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:12.250
but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested.

00:06:12.274 --> 00:06:14.519
That means there's
less competition for you

00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:17.325
and it's an extra incentive
for you to get in touch.

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.134
Whereas compare that
to if you think somebody is attractive

00:06:20.158 --> 00:06:23.375
but you suspect that everybody
is going to think they're attractive.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.604
Well, why would you bother
humiliating yourself, let's be honest?

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:29.470
But here's where the really
interesting part comes.

00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:33.674
Because when people choose the pictures
that they use on an online dating website,

00:06:33.698 --> 00:06:35.874
they often try to minimize the things

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:39.136
that they think some people
will find unattractive.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.191
The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.657
deliberately choosing
a very cropped photo,

00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.032
(Laughter)

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:48.816
or bald men, for example,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.788
deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats.

00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:54.402
But actually this is the opposite
of what you should do

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:55.816
if you want to be successful.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.174
You should really, instead,

00:06:57.198 --> 00:07:00.356
play up to whatever it is
that makes you different,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.531
even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive.

00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:07.766
Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.346
and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.923
OK, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner.

00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:17.600
So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.165
on the dating scene.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.724
But the question arises
of how do you then convert that success

00:07:23.748 --> 00:07:26.299
into longer-term happiness,

00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:31.413
and in particular, how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down?

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:34.245
Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:38.392
and marry the first person who comes along
and shows you any interest at all.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.537
But, equally, you don't really
want to leave it too long

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.331
if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:47.819
As my favorite author,
Jane Austen, puts it,

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.037
"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty

00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:53.493
can never hope to feel
or inspire affection again."

00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:56.182
(Laughter)

00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:57.388
Thanks a lot, Jane.

00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:58.825
What do you know about love?

00:07:58.849 --> 00:07:59.932
(Laughter)

00:07:59.956 --> 00:08:01.865
So the question is then,

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.478
how do you know when
is the right time to settle down,

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:07.130
given all the people
that you can date in your lifetime?

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:10.604
Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use

00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:13.172
to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:15.177
So let's imagine, then,

00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.803
that you start dating when you're 15

00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:21.596
and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.062
And there's a number of people

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.583
that you could potentially
date across your lifetime,

00:08:25.607 --> 00:08:27.735
and they'll be at varying
levels of goodness.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.424
Now the rules are that once
you cash in and get married,

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:32.878
you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had,

00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:35.435
and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind.

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:37.058
In my experience at least,

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:39.880
I find that typically people
don't much like being recalled

00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:45.122
years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me.

00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:48.339
So the math says then
that what you should do

00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:51.534
in the first 37 percent
of your dating window,

00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:55.315
you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential.

00:08:55.339 --> 00:08:57.489
(Laughter)

00:08:57.513 --> 00:09:01.137
And then, you should pick
the next person that comes along

00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:04.130
that is better than everybody
that you've seen before.

00:09:04.154 --> 00:09:05.575
So here's the example.

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:08.466
Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.951
that this is the best possible way

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:15.304
of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner.

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:19.909
Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks.

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:25.413
For instance, imagine
if your perfect partner appeared

00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:28.119
during your first 37 percent.

00:09:28.143 --> 00:09:30.915
Now, unfortunately,
you'd have to reject them.

00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:33.628
(Laughter)

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:36.244
Now, if you're following the maths,

00:09:36.268 --> 00:09:37.901
I'm afraid no one else comes along

00:09:37.925 --> 00:09:40.196
that's better than anyone
you've seen before,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.069
so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone.

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:46.092
(Laughter)

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.076
Probably surrounded by cats ...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.719
(Laughter)

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:51.405
nibbling at your remains.

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:55.398
OK, another risk is,
let's imagine, instead,

00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:58.538
that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent

00:09:58.562 --> 00:10:02.483
are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people.

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.221
That's OK, because
you're in your rejection phase,

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:06.960
so that's fine, you can reject them.

00:10:06.984 --> 00:10:10.357
But then imagine
the next person to come along

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:13.711
is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ...

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:14.834
(Laughter)

00:10:14.858 --> 00:10:16.756
than everybody that you've seen before.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.375
Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them ...

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.454
(Laughter)

00:10:21.478 --> 00:10:24.621
and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:25.798
Sorry about that.

00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:29.322
But I do think that there's an opportunity
here for Hallmark to cash in on

00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:30.928
and really cater for this market.

00:10:30.952 --> 00:10:32.535
A Valentine's Day card like this.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.715
(Laughter)

00:10:33.739 --> 00:10:36.741
"My darling husband,
you are marginally less terrible

00:10:36.765 --> 00:10:38.919
than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."

00:10:38.943 --> 00:10:40.573
(Laughter)

00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:43.435
It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage.

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:45.216
(Laughter)

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.901
OK, so this method doesn't give you
a 100 percent success rate,

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:53.360
but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better.

00:10:53.384 --> 00:10:56.814
And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types of fish

00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.655
which follow and employ
this exact strategy.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:02.432
So they reject every possible
suitor that turns up

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:05.145
in the first 37 percent
of the mating season,

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:08.920
and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window

00:11:08.944 --> 00:11:11.099
that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier

00:11:11.123 --> 00:11:13.701
than all of the fish
that they've seen before.

00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:18.602
I also think that subconsciously,
humans, we do sort of do this anyway.

00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:21.471
We give ourselves a little bit of time
to play the field,

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:25.091
get a feel for the marketplace
or whatever when we're young.

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:29.705
And then we only start looking seriously
at potential marriage candidates

00:11:29.729 --> 00:11:31.756
once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.990
I think this is conclusive proof,
if ever it were needed,

00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:39.222
that everybody's brains are prewired
to be just a little bit mathematical.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.453
OK, so that was Top Tip #2.

00:11:41.477 --> 00:11:44.706
Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.

00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:48.275
OK, so let's imagine then
that you picked your perfect partner

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:52.528
and you're settling into
a lifelong relationship with them.

00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:56.538
Now, I like to think that everybody
would ideally like to avoid divorce,

00:11:56.562 --> 00:12:00.808
apart from, I don't know,
Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?

00:12:00.832 --> 00:12:01.982
(Laughter)

00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:04.605
But it's a sad fact of modern life

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:07.889
that one in two marriages
in the States ends in divorce,

00:12:07.913 --> 00:12:11.705
with the rest of the world
not being far behind.

00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:13.563
Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps

00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:17.320
for thinking that the arguments
that precede a marital breakup

00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:21.134
are not an ideal candidate
for mathematical investigation.

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:23.141
For one thing, it's very hard to know

00:12:23.165 --> 00:12:26.242
what you should be measuring
or what you should be quantifying.

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:32.449
But this didn't stop a psychologist,
John Gottman, who did exactly that.

00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:37.710
Gottman observed hundreds of couples
having a conversation

00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:40.040
and recorded, well,
everything you can think of.

00:12:40.064 --> 00:12:42.431
So he recorded what was said
in the conversation,

00:12:42.455 --> 00:12:44.748
he recorded their skin conductivity,

00:12:44.772 --> 00:12:46.835
he recorded their facial expressions,

00:12:46.859 --> 00:12:48.850
their heart rates, their blood pressure,

00:12:48.874 --> 00:12:55.110
basically everything apart from whether
or not the wife was actually always right,

00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:58.325
which incidentally she totally is.

00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:00.998
But what Gottman and his team found

00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:04.037
was that one of the most
important predictors

00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:06.543
for whether or not a couple
is going to get divorced

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:11.190
was how positive or negative each partner
was being in the conversation.

00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:13.544
Now, couples that were very low-risk

00:13:13.568 --> 00:13:17.837
scored a lot more positive points
on Gottman's scale than negative.

00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:20.402
Whereas bad relationships,

00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:23.173
by which I mean,
probably going to get divorced,

00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:27.554
they found themselves getting
into a spiral of negativity.

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:29.838
Now just by using these very simple ideas,

00:13:29.862 --> 00:13:32.333
Gottman and his group were able to predict

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:35.079
whether a given couple
was going to get divorced

00:13:35.103 --> 00:13:37.288
with a 90 percent accuracy.

00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:41.294
But it wasn't until he teamed up
with a mathematician, James Murray,

00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:43.209
that they really started to understand

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:47.727
what causes these negativity spirals
and how they occur.

00:13:47.751 --> 00:13:49.284
And the results that they found,

00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:53.957
I think, are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting.

00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:58.544
So these equations predict how the wife
or husband is going to respond

00:13:58.568 --> 00:14:00.456
in their next turn of the conversation,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.613
how positive or negative
they're going to be.

00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:04.022
And these equations depend on

00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:06.352
the mood of the person
when they're on their own,

00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:08.990
the mood of the person when
they're with their partner,

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.739
but most importantly, they depend on

00:14:10.763 --> 00:14:13.795
how much the husband and wife
influence one another.

00:14:14.115 --> 00:14:16.722
Now, I think it's important
to point out at this stage,

00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:20.255
that these exact equations
have also been shown

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:22.474
to be perfectly able at describing

00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:26.232
what happens between two countries
in an arms race.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.098
(Laughter)

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.881
So that an arguing couple
spiraling into negativity

00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:35.810
and teetering on the brink of divorce

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:40.083
is actually mathematically equivalent
to the beginning of a nuclear war.

00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:42.997
(Laughter)

00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:45.334
But the really important term
in this equation

00:14:45.358 --> 00:14:47.853
is the influence that people
have on one another,

00:14:47.877 --> 00:14:51.134
and in particular, something called
"the negativity threshold."

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:52.890
Now, the negativity threshold,

00:14:52.914 --> 00:14:57.541
you can think of as
how annoying the husband can be

00:14:57.565 --> 00:15:01.828
before the wife starts to get
really pissed off, and vice versa.

00:15:01.852 --> 00:15:06.384
Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding

00:15:06.408 --> 00:15:09.170
and allowing the person
to have the space to be themselves.

00:15:09.194 --> 00:15:12.547
So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships

00:15:12.571 --> 00:15:15.851
were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold.

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:17.668
Where couples let things go

00:15:17.692 --> 00:15:20.463
and only brought things up
if they really were a big deal.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:24.738
But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team

00:15:24.762 --> 00:15:27.294
have shown the exact opposite is true.

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:30.108
The best couples,
or the most successful couples,

00:15:30.132 --> 00:15:33.495
are the ones with a really low
negativity threshold.

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:37.153
These are the couples
that don't let anything go unnoticed

00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:40.375
and allow each other
some room to complain.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:45.633
These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship,

00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:48.400
that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage.

00:15:48.424 --> 00:15:50.492
Couples that don't let things go

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:55.396
and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal.

00:15:56.426 --> 00:16:01.684
Now of course, it takes a bit more
than just a low negativity threshold

00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:06.076
and not compromising
to have a successful relationship.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.626
But I think that it's quite interesting

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.004
to know that there is really
mathematical evidence

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:14.456
to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.164
So those are my top three tips

00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:19.359
of how maths can help you
with love and relationships.

00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:21.778
But I hope, that aside from
their use as tips,

00:16:21.802 --> 00:16:25.904
they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics.

00:16:25.928 --> 00:16:30.269
Because for me, equations
and symbols aren't just a thing.

00:16:30.684 --> 00:16:35.095
They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.905
and the startling simplicity

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:41.742
in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us,

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:44.346
from how the world works to how we behave.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.680
So I hope that perhaps,
for just a couple of you,

00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:49.189
a little bit of insight
into the mathematics of love

00:16:49.213 --> 00:16:52.510
can persuade you to have
a little bit more love for mathematics.

00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:53.733
Thank you.

00:16:53.757 --> 00:17:00.757
(Applause)
