00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:18.230
Two years ago, after having served four years

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.890
in the United States Marine Corps

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.250
and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.199
I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.436
of veterans and medical professionals

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:29.869
in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.395
three days after the earthquake.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.558
We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:37.089
the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.095
we realized something. Military veterans

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.108
are very, very good at disaster response.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:45.583
And coming home, my cofounder and I,

00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:48.846
we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:51.852
The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.166
It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.547
and it's not using the best people.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:59.752
The second problem that we became aware of

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:02.230
was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.375
and this is a topic that is front page news right now

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.536
as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:09.686
and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:11.566
And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.300
and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.762
These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:20.832
Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.233
for service for the veterans coming home.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.733
Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.973
to continue their service when they take off their uniform.

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:31.643
And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.

00:01:31.643 --> 00:01:34.706
Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:37.715
we responded to the tsunami in Chile,

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.609
the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.241
But it was earlier this year, when one of our

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.346
original members caused us to shift focus in the organization.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:51.091
This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.417
We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:57.351
Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:01.237
Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.967
This was a tragedy, but it really forced us

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:07.245
to refocus what it is that we were doing.

00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:10.709
You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.317
in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself

00:02:13.317 --> 00:02:16.466
because of what he lost when he came home.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.931
He lost purpose. He lost his community.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:24.366
And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.540
And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.854
from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:35.094
in the initial iteration of our organization,

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:37.967
we were a disaster response organization that was using

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.206
veteran service. We had a lot of success,

00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:44.419
and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.828
But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.304
now moving forward, we see ourselves

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:55.197
as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:57.807
Because we think that we can give that purpose

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:00.988
and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.

00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:03.219
And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.920
Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.329
Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.805
who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:15.369
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.041
They send him to Iraq.

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.768
Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:23.372
That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:25.461
It's to keep the men around him alive.

00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:27.647
It's to pacify the village that he works in.

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:31.311
He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.909
maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.273
but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.

00:03:36.273 --> 00:03:38.413
You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri

00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:40.773
after a tornado, he regains that.

00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:43.822
Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.767
in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.475
the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.382
Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:54.543
He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.

00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:56.726
He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:59.425
They've eaten together. They've bled together.

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.823
He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.

00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:04.883
He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:06.222
He doesn't have that community anymore.

00:04:06.222 --> 00:04:09.456
But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.947
they get that sense of community back.

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:14.386
Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.042
high school in Kansas City.

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:17.758
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.297
They send him to Iraq.

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:23.652
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.

00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:26.070
He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.683
in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.

00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:30.956
He doesn't have that same self-worth.

00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:33.568
But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:35.388
and somebody once again is walking up to him

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.762
and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,

00:04:37.762 --> 00:04:40.079
now they have self-worth again.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.400
I think it's very important, because right now

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.163
somebody needs to step up,

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:46.114
and this generation of veterans has the opportunity

00:04:46.114 --> 00:04:48.399
to do that if they are given the chance.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.923
Thank you very much. (Applause)
