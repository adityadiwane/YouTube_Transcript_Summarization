Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:17.731
and we both study complex networks.

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.566
And we met a couple years ago when we discovered

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.566
that we had both given a short TED Talk

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.869
about the ecology of war,

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.316
and we realized that we were connected

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.134
by the ideas we shared before we ever met.

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:29.690
And then we thought, you know, there are thousands

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.804
of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:34.015
that are popping up all over the world.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:34.938
How are they connected,

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:36.948
and what does that global conversation look like?

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.758
So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:43.525
Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:46.571
from around the world, 147 different countries,

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:48.694
and we took these talks and we wanted to find

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:50.734
the mathematical structures that underly

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.456
the ideas behind them.

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:53.826
And we wanted to do that so we could see how

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:55.879
they connected with each other.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.555
And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:58.511
you need a lot of data.

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:02.197
So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,

00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:03.965
and we can go down and basically pull

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.232
all the open information from YouTube,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.581
all the comments, all the views, who's watching it,

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.360
where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.652
But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,

00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:16.780
we can pull the entire transcript,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.460
and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.566
So we can take their transcript

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.664
and actually do some pretty cool things.

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:25.824
We can take natural language processing algorithms

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:28.453
to kind of read through with a computer, line by line,

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:30.812
extracting key concepts from this.

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:33.337
And we take those key concepts and they sort of form

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:36.902
this mathematical structure of an idea.

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:38.659
And we call that the meme-ome.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.810
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.236
is the mathematics that underlies an idea,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.168
and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:47.149
which I want to share with you now.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.339
So each idea has its own meme-ome,

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:51.290
and each idea is unique with that,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.778
but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:54.962
they kind of steal sometimes,

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:56.789
and they certainly build on each other,

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.405
and we can go through mathematically

00:01:58.405 --> 00:02:00.245
and take the meme-ome from one talk

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:02.699
and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:04.672
and if there's a similarity between the two of them,

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:07.922
we can create a link and represent that as a graph,

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.316
just like Eric and I are connected.

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:11.710
So that's theory, that's great.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.236
Let's see how it works in actual practice.

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.024
So what we've got here now is the global footprint

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:19.317
of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years

00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:20.867
exploding out around the world

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.196
from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:28.031
And what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:30.565
and we started to see where the connections occurred,

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.102
where they connected with each other.

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:33.976
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.551
connected over into Europe.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:37.963
We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine

00:02:37.963 --> 00:02:40.218
radiating outwards from the Middle East.

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:41.516
And we've got something a little broader

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.672
like big data with a truly global footprint

00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:45.851
reminiscent of a conversation

00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:47.867
that is happening everywhere.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.040
So from this, we kind of run up against the limits

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.570
of what we can actually do with a geographic projection,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.622
but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out

00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:56.168
into multidimensional space.

00:02:56.168 --> 00:02:58.043
So we can take in our network projection

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.793
and apply a physics engine to this,

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:01.678
and the similar talks kind of smash together,

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:03.682
and the different ones fly apart,

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.754
and what we're left with is something quite beautiful.

00:03:05.754 --> 00:03:08.711
EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.300
they're linked if they share similar ideas,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.384
and that comes from a machine reading

00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:15.451
of entire talk transcripts,

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:17.682
and then all these topics that pop out,

00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:19.472
they're not from tags and keywords.

00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:21.197
They come from the network structure

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.365
of interconnected ideas. Keep going.

00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:25.387
SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,

00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:26.862
but he's going to slow me down.

00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:28.896
We've got education connected to storytelling

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:30.539
triangulated next to social media.

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.014
You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,

00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:34.400
which you might expect,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.795
but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:39.535
as those two spaces interface with each other.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.070
But I want to take you into one cluster

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.938
that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.

00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:45.431
And I want to kind of zoom in on that

00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:47.794
and see if we can get a little more resolution.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.141
So as we go in here, what we start to see,

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.645
apply the physics engine again,

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.321
we see what's one conversation

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.881
is actually composed of many smaller ones.

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:57.810
The structure starts to emerge

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.880
where we see a kind of fractal behavior

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.499
of the words and the language that we use

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.201
to describe the things that are important to us

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.634
all around this world.

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:06.966
So you've got food economy and local food at the top,

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:09.685
you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:12.316
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:14.617
each connected to each other through the ideas

00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:15.918
and the language they share,

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.368
creating a broader concept of the environment.

00:04:18.368 --> 00:04:19.900
And of course, from here, we can go

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.434
and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?

00:04:23.434 --> 00:04:25.779
And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.453
This is their kind of resonance

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:29.859
for the conversation around the environment.

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:31.758
If we split along gender lines,

00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:33.745
we can see females resonating heavily

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:37.390
with food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.872
And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,

00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:41.634
and I'll throw to Eric for the next part.

00:04:41.634 --> 00:04:43.236
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:44.774
you cannot get this kind of perspective

00:04:44.774 --> 00:04:48.134
from a simple tag search on YouTube.

00:04:48.134 --> 00:04:52.322
Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:54.856
out of environment, and look at all the talks together.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:57.783
Now often, when we're faced with this amount of content,

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:00.214
we do a couple of things to simplify it.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:01.528
We might just say, well,

00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:04.357
what are the most popular talks out there?

00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:05.754
And a few rise to the surface.

00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:07.582
There's a talk about gratitude.

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.926
There's another one about personal health and nutrition.

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:13.855
And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.089
And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.611
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now?

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.932
And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic

00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:25.598
is about digital privacy.

00:05:25.598 --> 00:05:27.291
So this is great. It simplifies things.

00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:29.118
But there's so much creative content

00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:31.039
that's just buried at the bottom.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.357
And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface

00:05:34.357 --> 00:05:36.815
that's maybe really creative and interesting?

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:39.746
Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.176
to do that.

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:43.290
Remember, it's that network structure

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.558
that is creating these emergent topics,

00:05:45.558 --> 00:05:47.073
and let's say we could take two of them,

00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:50.120
like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.689
that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.964
And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix

00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:56.804
is one of the hallmarks of innovation.

00:05:56.804 --> 00:05:58.410
Well here's one by Jessica Green

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.789
about the microbial ecology of buildings.

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.799
It's literally defining a new field.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:04.902
And we could go back to those topics and say, well,

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.670
what talks are central to those conversations?

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.360
In the cities cluster, one of the most central

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.312
was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,

00:06:13.312 --> 00:06:15.032
and in the genetics cluster,

00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:18.225
we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.

00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:21.578
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.

00:06:21.578 --> 00:06:23.421
We could go the other direction and say, well,

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.693
what are talks that are broadly synthesizing

00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:27.141
a lot of different kinds of fields.

00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.674
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.

00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:32.410
Like, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.590
very synthetic.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.668
And then, of course, there are talks that are so unique

00:06:35.668 --> 00:06:38.758
they're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:41.272
and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.

00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:44.306
And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:45.849
and I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.521
in the stratosphere of our idea space?"

00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:50.776
And apparently it smells like bacon.

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:52.567
I wouldn't know.

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:54.815
So we're using these network motifs

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.001
to find talks that are unique,

00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:58.711
ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:00.370
ones that are central to their topic,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.744
and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:05.846
Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession

00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:08.159
with what's trending now.

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.045
And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:14.005
or the patterns of how things are connected.

00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:15.630
SG: So that's exactly right.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.109
We've got ourselves in a world

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:20.153
that's massively complex,

00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:23.020
and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.806
so we can navigate through it.

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.144
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,

00:07:27.144 --> 00:07:30.620
are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.186
because we can realize that their complexity is not random.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.140
It has mathematical structure,

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.943
and we can use that mathematical structure

00:07:36.943 --> 00:07:39.157
to go and explore things like the world of ideas

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:42.157
to see what's being said, to see what's not being said,

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.564
and to be a little bit more human

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:45.431
and, hopefully, a little smarter.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:46.397
Thank you.

00:07:46.397 --> 00:07:50.617
(Applause)
