00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
You all know this story.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
In the summer of 1950,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
and atomic-pile builder,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
"Where is everybody?"

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
This confused his colleagues, obviously,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
because they were sitting right there with him.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
He was talking about the space aliens.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
You see, this was only a few years after

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
the supposed flying saucer crash

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
at Roswell, New Mexico.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And even though that turned out to be nothing,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
nothing at all --

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
(Laughter) --

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
merely a downed weather balloon

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
piloted by small hairless men

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
with slits for mouths ...

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Still, America had gone saucer-mad,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.330
even famous scientists

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
who were eating lunch.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
is that the universe is so vast

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
that it stands to reason,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
there should be other intelligent life out there.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330
And the universe is so old

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
we should have some evidence of their existence by now.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
and his colleagues had no answer.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
to disprove fairies,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
Sasquatch, God,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
the possibility of love --

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330
and thereafter, as you know,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
Enrico Fermi ate alone.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
(Laughter)

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.330
Now,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
I am not a scientist.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
I have never built an atomic pile.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Although, I might argue that, technically,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
every pile is atomic.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
(Laughter)

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
One is that the aliens might be

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
very far away.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Perhaps, I dare say,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
even on other planets.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
The other possibility --

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
(Laughter) --

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
was an alien.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
(Laughter)

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Think about it.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
Isn't it a little convenient

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
suddenly an Italian scientist showed up

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
with an amazing new technology

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
that would transform everything in the world

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.330
and darken the history of the human species forever after?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
And isn't it a little strange

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
that he required no payment for this?

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
That he asked for only one thing --

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
a gift of two healthy sperm whales?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
That's -- that's not true.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
But it is strange.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
(Laughter)

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
his fellow scientists

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.330
that the space aliens are not already here?

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
For it is given in certain UFO-ology

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
or UFOlogy circles,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
that they have walked among us in disguise,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
observing us, guiding our evolution

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
from ape to man --

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
if you believe in that sort of thing --

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
(Laughter)

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
It's a difficult theory to discount,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
I think you'll agree.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
(Laughter)

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
For even in my own life,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
there are memories I have

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
that are difficult to explain --

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
that it is difficult to imagine

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
they were not the result

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
For how else will you explain

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
the amazing and absolutely true

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
close encounters that I had

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and will describe to you now?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
This was the summer when the special edition of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.330
(Laughter)

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
And so I spent the rest of the vacation

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
the sidewalk still warm from the sun,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
watching the skies for UFOs.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
What did I see? Stars, satellites,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.330
Occasionally, kids would come and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
join me and watch,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
to play video games and mingle with humans.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
so I stayed alone with the cosmos.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.330
And that's when it happened.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
An elderly couple came walking down the street.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
I would say they were in their late seventies,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
and I would say that they were on a date,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
because he was wearing a very neat little suit

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.330
and a chill was coming in off the ocean.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
I remember, for some reason,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
that they were exactly the same height.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
And then they stopped, and the man turned to me

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
and said,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
"What are you looking for,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.330
flying saucers?"

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
(Laughter)

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
for an old man on a date.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
But what was stranger still --

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
and even I realized it at the time,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
as a nine-year-old child --

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
was that they stopped at all.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
with his sweetheart with the precise reason

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
of making fun of a child.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
"Oh," he said,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
"little green men."

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
And then his girlfriend joined in, too.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
"There's no such thing as space men," she said.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
"There's no such thing."

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.330
And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
I looked around.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
The street was entirely empty.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
It was as though time had stopped.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
I did not know why they were teasing me.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
I looked into their strangely angry faces,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
and I remember wondering,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
are they wearing rubber masks?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
(Laughter)

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.330
Slits for mouths?

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.330
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
and then he made laser sounds.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
"Kew, kew, kew --

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
watch out."

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
And they turned at once and walked away.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
The old man reached out

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
his knobbly claw

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
for the woman's hand,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
and found it, and left me alone.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
a strange encounter among humans.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
Maybe it was swamp gas, but --

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
(Laughter) --

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
I know what I saw.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.330
Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
I went to see the movie "Dune,"

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
(Laughter) --

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
this is impossible on its face, I realize --

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
but it is absolutely true.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
It was opening night, naturally.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
On my right was the girl in question.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
She was very tall, I would say.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
I didn't know her name, and I never will.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.330
They were both big fans, mother and daughter --

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.330
very unusual.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
They were talking about how their favorite characters

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
were the giant sandworms.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
And then it got stranger.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
That's when she turned to me and said,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
(Laughter)

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.330
First of all, I was embarrassed

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
I was merely a connoisseur of movies

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
featuring desert planets, as I still am.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
(Laughter)

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.330
apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
as though she just wanted to talk to me.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
I did not even turn my head.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
The movie began.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.330
in which all of the characters

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
were sexy and deformed at the same time.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
(Laughter)

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
of psychedelic spice

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
swirling around him,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
allowing him to bend space and time.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
He could never leave the tank

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
or interact with the outside world.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
He had become, in his isolation,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
so deformed and so sexy,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
to the outside world, and could never touch them.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
Please.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
When the movie ended,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
everyone seemed very happy

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.330
Except for the girl.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.330
As I walked out, her pace slowed.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.330
Perhaps it was the crutches,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.330
but it seemed --

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
(Laughter) --

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.330
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.330
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
but I can only come to the conclusion

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.330
that it was what, in the alien abductee community,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
they call a "screen memory":

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
and flown off to a sex pyramid.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
(Laughter)

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
And so I sure am glad

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
I did not slow down to talk to her.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
I sure am glad I never saw her again.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
1989.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
In the mid-to-late '80s,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
in which he described his own lifelong experiences

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
being abducted by aliens.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
as "lost time,"

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
were taking him and giving him rectal probes.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
(Laughter)

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
and was his, sort of, police sketch

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
of what the creatures looked like

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
that Whitley Strieber had described to him.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.330
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
And in 1989, the way I remember it,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
I was in Philadelphia

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
One: Whitley Strieber

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
was played by Christopher Walken.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
(Laughter)

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
Three: there was a surprisingly long

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.330
sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.330
gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
Four: this was being shown

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
Five: all of which is to say,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
and it starred Christopher Walken.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
Does something seem strange about this to you?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
Think about it. Yes. The answer is:

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
I had a girlfriend. What?

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
(Laughter)

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
How did this happen? When did this happen?

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
I remember walking out of the theater

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
as we walked hand in hand,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
and pondering these very same questions.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.330
And to this day, I have no answer for you.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.330
Close encounter four: the Algarve,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
Portugal, 1991.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
Some years later, I and this woman --

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
(Laughter) --

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.330
went traveling through the south of Portugal together.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.330
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.330
in tiny little hotels,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and watch the sun set and play checkers.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.330
We went to some topless beaches.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
Excuse me? No, not in my life.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.330
which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
and the lead dog bit me on the ass,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
and receive an ass shot.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
Make of that what you will.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.330
(Laughter)

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
Our last day in Portugal,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
we were in the district capital of Faro,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
one last time.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
Now, Faro is a bustling little city,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
a bus and then a boat.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
And did I want to come with?

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
I remember what she looked like before she left.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
The freckles had grown

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
and multiplied on her face and shoulders,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
clustering into a kind of a tan.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
A tan, we were both tan --

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
is this true?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
She was smiling.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
not even speaking the language,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
to travel alone by bus and boat

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
to go to a beach she did not know

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
or had never seen.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
I loved her, and then she went out

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
into that strange, alien land.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.330
It took me some time to come to my senses.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.330
I had my own "lost time" moment,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
where I woke up and suddenly realized

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.330
it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
and she had not come back.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Now, I did not speak Portuguese.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
I did not know where the beach was.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.330
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
(Laughter)

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
I realized that the day would only have

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
two possible outcomes:

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
either Catherine would come back to the hotel,

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
or she would never come back to the hotel.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
And so I sat down to wait.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.330
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
where the buses and cars and pedestrians

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
and little scooters were moving along.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
And I watched those constellations shift,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
hoping that they would part and I would see her face.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
It was at that moment,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
in that very small town of 30,000 or so,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.330
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
and the searching we might do in it.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.330
And that's when the Liberians came along.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
what was I doing, and I explained.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.330
But he did not seem so very sure,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.330
for he sat down to wait with me.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.330
telling me jokes, distracting me.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.330
Two hours, they gave me a message.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
We are not alone.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
I turned and looked down the street.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
The stars aligned, and she came back.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.330
She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
Neither did the Liberians,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
and left us alone in the street, holding hands.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.330
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.330
much like a piece of alien technology

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.330
that has been inserted into your buttocks

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
by a "Portuguese doctor."

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
(Laughter)

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.330
And even now, a decade and a half later,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
even now that we are married,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.330
I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
that during the time she was away,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.330
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
I love her and wait for her still.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
Thank you for your kind attention.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
(Applause)
