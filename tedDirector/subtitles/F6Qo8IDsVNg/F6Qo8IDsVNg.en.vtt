00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:14.649
Picture this:

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:15.742
It's Monday morning,

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:16.861
you're at the office,

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.615
you're settling in for the day at work,

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:21.437
and this guy that you sort of 
recognize from down the hall,

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:23.273
walks right into your cubicle

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.675
and he steals your chair.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:25.917
Doesn't say a word —

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:27.305
just rolls away with it.

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:29.788
Doesn't give you any information
about why he took your chair

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:31.899
out of all the other chairs 
that are out there.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.041
Doesn't acknowledge the fact 
that you might need your chair

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.582
to get some work done today.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:37.839
You wouldn't stand for 
it. You'd make a stink.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.866
You'd follow that guy
back to his cubicle

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.178
and you'd say, "Why my chair?"

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:47.299
Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning
and you're at the office,

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.028
and a meeting invitation pops 
up in your calendar.

00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:51.633
(Laughter)

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.709
And it's from this woman who you 
kind of know from down the hall,

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:58.514
and the subject line references some 
project that you heard a little bit about.

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.197
But there's no agenda.

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:03.273
There's no information about why
you were invited to the meeting.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:07.889
And yet you accept the 
meeting invitation, and you go.

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.816
And when this highly 
unproductive session is over,

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.499
you go back to your desk,

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.008
and you stand at your 
desk and you say,

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.671
"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.674
like I wish I had my chair back."

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:20.180
(Laughter)

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.751
Every day, we allow our coworkers,

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:24.965
who are otherwise very, 
very nice people,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:26.632
to steal from us.

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:30.710
And I'm talking about something far 
more valuable than office furniture.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.739
I'm talking about time. Your time.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.392
In fact, I believe that

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.877
we are in the middle
of a global epidemic

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:43.917
of a terrible new illness
known as MAS:

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:46.190
Mindless Accept Syndrome.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.084
(Laughter)

00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:50.785
The primary symptom of 
Mindless Accept Syndrome

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.705
is just accepting a meeting invitation
the minute it pops up in your calendar.

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:55.975
(Laughter)

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:59.643
It's an involuntary reflex — ding, 
click, bing — it's in your calendar,

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:02.936
"Gotta go, I'm already late 
for a meeting." (Laughter)

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:05.323
Meetings are important, right?

00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:08.269
And collaboration is key to 
the success of any enterprise.

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.662
And a well-run meeting can yield 
really positive, actionable results.

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:13.420
But between globalization

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.735
and pervasive information technology,

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.406
the way that we work

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:20.635
has really changed dramatically 
over the last few years.

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:23.842
And we're miserable. (Laughter)

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:27.382
And we're miserable not because the 
other guy can't run a good meeting,

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:30.194
it's because of MAS, our 
Mindless Accept Syndrome,

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:33.970
which is a self-inflicted wound.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.117
Actually, I have evidence to prove
that MAS is a global epidemic.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.764
Let me tell you why.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:45.036
A couple of years ago, I put a video 
on Youtube, and in the video,

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:48.234
I acted out every terrible 
conference call you've ever been on.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.893
It goes on for about five minutes,

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:53.084
and it has all the things that we 
hate about really bad meetings.

00:02:53.084 --> 00:02:56.427
There's the moderator who has 
no idea how to run the meeting.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:58.985
There are the participants who 
have no idea why they're there.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:02.688
The whole thing kind of collapses
into this collaborative train wreck.

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:05.114
And everybody leaves very angry.

00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:06.903
It's kind of funny.

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.486
(Laughter)

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.638
Let's take a quick look.

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:14.465
(Video) Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.552
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:16.552 --> 00:03:19.331
bloop bloop —

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.898
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:25.910
Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.800
(Laughter)

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.868
Hi, Joe. Thanks for 
joining us today, great.

00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:33.658
I was just saying, we have a lot of people 
on the call we'd like to get through,

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:35.292
so let's skip the roll call 

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:37.965
and I'm gonna dive right in.

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:41.840
Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.405
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:45.698
bloop bloop —

00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:47.161
(Laughter)

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.184
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:53.993
No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)

00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:55.629
Sound familiar?

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.606
Yeah, it sounds familiar 
to me, too.

00:03:57.606 --> 00:03:59.662
A couple of weeks after I put that online,

00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:02.463
500,000 people in dozens of countries,

00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:04.103
I mean dozens of countries,

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:05.287
watched this video.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.641
And three years later, it's still getting 
thousands of views every month.

00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:10.608
It's close to about a million right now.

00:04:10.608 --> 00:04:12.616
And in fact, some of the biggest
companies in the world,

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:14.526
companies that you've 
heard of but I won't name,

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:18.421
have asked for my permission to use 
this video in their new-hire training

00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:22.670
to teach their new employees how 
not to run a meeting at their company.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.155
And if the numbers —

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:26.536
there are a million views and it's
being used by all these companies —

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:30.062
aren't enough proof that we have 
a global problem with meetings,

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:31.839
there are the many, many thousands

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.459
of comments posted online

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:35.647
after the video went up.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.621
Thousands of people wrote things like,

00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.475
"OMG, that was my day today!"

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:41.438
"That was my day every day!"

00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:42.597
"This is my life."

00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:43.527
One guy wrote,

00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:45.066
"It's funny because it's true.

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:46.973
Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.

00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:48.691
It made me laugh until I cried.

00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:51.441
And cried. And I cried some more."

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.073
(Laughter)

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:54.534
This poor guy said,

00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:59.611
"My daily life until 
retirement or death, sigh."

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:01.011
These are real quotes

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:02.810
and it's real sad.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.633
A common theme running through
all of these comments online

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:08.174
is this fundamental belief 
that we are powerless

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.075
to do anything other 
than go to meetings

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:12.453
and suffer through these 
poorly run meetings

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:14.542
and live to meet another day.

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:17.683
But the truth is, we're 
not powerless at all.

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:20.776
In fact, the cure for MAS
is right here in our hands.

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.977
It's right at our fingertips, literally.

00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:26.238
It's something that I call ¡No MAS!

00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:28.468
(Laughter)

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:30.866
Which, if I remember my 
high school Spanish,

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:33.657
means something like, 
"Enough already, make it stop!"

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:36.409
Here's how No MAS 
works. It's very simple.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.606
First of all, the next time you 
get a meeting invitation

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.453
that doesn't have a lot 
of information in it at all,

00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:44.293
click the tentative button!

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:46.743
It's okay, you're allowed, 
that's why it's there.

00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:48.252
It's right next to the accept button.

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:51.846
Or the maybe button, or whatever button 
is there for you not to accept immediately.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:55.629
Then, get in touch with the person
who asked you to the meeting.

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.215
Tell them you're very excited 
to support their work,

00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:00.230
ask them what the goal 
of the meeting is,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.917
and tell them you're interested in learning 
how you can help them achieve their goal.

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:05.845
And if we do this often enough,

00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:07.183
and we do it respectfully,

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:09.220
people might start to be 
a little bit more thoughtful

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.682
about the way they put together
meeting invitations.

00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:14.534
And you can make more thoughtful 
decisions about accepting it.

00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:17.794
People might actually start 
sending out agendas. Imagine!

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:21.542
Or they might not have a conference call
with 12 people to talk about a status

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:24.825
when they could just do a quick
email and get it done with.

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:29.659
People just might start to change their 
behavior because you changed yours.

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.144
And they just might bring
your chair back, too. (Laughter)

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:34.519
No MAS!

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.959
Thank you.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.025
(Applause).
