00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
So let's start talking about that.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
That's what I have behind myself.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
(Laughter)

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
But of course what we have to remember is this.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
And what you have to think about is,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
is I'm going to talk first about the flames --

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
where we are in the economy --

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
and then I'm going to take three trends

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and that will take place in this conference

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
and I will try and bring them together.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Those three trends are

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
the ability to engineer cells,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
the ability to engineer tissues,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
and robots.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And somehow it will all make sense.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
But anyway, let's start with the economy.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
One is leverage.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
And the problem with leverage is

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
(Laughter)

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
it's an investment bank;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
it has 15 to 20 times.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Oops.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
are making such generous and wonderful donations

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
to these nice folks.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And as you think about that,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
(Laughter)

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
It ain't pretty.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.160
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
We all love Santa Claus, right?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
But the problem with Santa Clause is,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
and promising folks,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160
it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
on what we call "entitlements."

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
that we've brought that date of reckoning forward

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
to about 2017.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
but, guess what?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
We're going to start to pay them.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.160
it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Right?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
(Laughter)

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And he gave an interview in December.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
Here's his first bit of advice.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
And here's his second bit of advice.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
And, by the way,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
This stuff is getting serious enough

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
we're going to end up losing the dollar.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And then all bets are off.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
I think I can safely say

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
This is an actual bill.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
And it's 10 triliion dollars.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
a buck next week.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.160
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
you've just got to say no.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
And the reason we have to do that in the short term

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
is because we have just run out of cash.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
The orange slice is what's discretionary.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
Everything else is mandated.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
So what we have to start thinking about doing

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
is capping our medical spending

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
We've got to start thinking about asking people

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
to retire a little bit later.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Your 401(k) just got nailed.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
The reason why that's reasonable is,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
when your grandparents were given Social Security,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Sixty-eight is young today.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
We've got to quit borrowing as much,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And if we don't start changing this trend line,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
we are going to lose the dollar

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
and start to look like Iceland.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
I got what you're thinking.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
(Laughter)

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
back in the late '80s.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And its 225 largest companies today

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
We don't fix this now,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
And unless you want this person

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
we'd better deal with this stuff.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
That's the short term. That's the flame part.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
That's the financial crisis.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160
that we need to talk about.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
That wave is much larger, much more powerful,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
and that's of course the wave of technology.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
And what's really important in this stuff is,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
as we cut, we also have to grow.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Among other things, because startup companies

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
and they're about 17.8 percent of output.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
And that's what we've got to keep growing.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And that's where these three trends come together.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
That's where the ability to engineer microbes,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
the ability to engineer tissues,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
and the ability to engineer robots

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
begin to lead to a reboot.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Craig Venter showed up last year

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
In parallel, the folks at MIT

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
have been building a standard registry of biological parts.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.160
And start building stuff.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.160
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
and started to build these little odd creatures.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
Here was one of the first things they built.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
So, cells have this cycle.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
First they don't grow.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
Then they grow exponentially.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
Then they stop growing.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
So they engineered these cells

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
they would smell like wintergreen.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
This got a bit more complicated two years later.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
They started competing.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.160
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
that makes red wine good for you

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
into beer.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
(Laughter)

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
that they would act as your kidneys.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And people oohed and ahhed,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160
because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
And that was very cool stuff back then.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
let me show you what's happened in that period of time.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
Two years ago, you saw this creature.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
called an axolotl

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
that can re-generate its limbs.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
It's almost like leaving Congress.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
(Laughter)

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.160
because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
This should not surprise you, right?

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
I mean, you're born with no teeth.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
You re-grow a set of teeth.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
unless, if you're a lawyer.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
(Laughter)

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
But, of course, for most of us,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and simply implant it.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
And we can do it with other things.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
they took all the cells off the trachea,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
She regrew her own trachea,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
and 72 hours later it was implanted.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
She's now running around with her kids.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and he's also re-growing bladders.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
So there are now nine women walking around Boston

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
with re-grown bladders,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
for the rest of your life.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
This is kind of getting boring, right?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
I mean, you understand where this story's going.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.160
But, I mean it gets more interesting.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
leaving just the cartilage.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
Life happens.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
This may be one of the ultimate papers.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.160
and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
That meant that you can take the stuff right here,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
and turn it into almost anything in your body.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
it's moving in a whole series of places.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Third trend: robots.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And all we've got is a Roomba.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
(Laughter)

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
Didn't happen.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
So, Rosie runs around on skates

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
and the other one ran on flat threads.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.160
which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
that's when computers have reached human intelligence.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
This is not an intelligence Turing rest,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
And this stuff is moving very quickly,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160
These are not the only interesting robots.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
You've also got flies, the size of flies,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.160
that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
And as you bring these things together,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.160
as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
you begin to get some really odd questions.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
In the last Olympics, this gentleman,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
who had several world records in the Special Olympics,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
tried to run in the normal Olympics.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.160
is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
He came within about a second of qualifying.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
He sued to be allowed to run,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
and he won the suit,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
but didn't qualify by time.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.160
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
is going to make the time.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.160
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160
and then your parents had these odd boxes

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
that would squawk at odd times during dinner,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
And now you have cochlear implants

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.160
that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
and these are machine generations, not human generations.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
They'll be able to focus their hearing,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
do a series of things that we can't do.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160
And the same thing is happening in eyes.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.160
so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Very primitive.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
And then they'll be able to see shape.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
they'll be able to come into a microfocus.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
All of these things are coming together,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
and it's a particularly important thing to understand,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160
as we worry about the flames of the present,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
to keep an eye on the future.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.160
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.160
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.160
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.160
There have actually been 22 species of hominids

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160
that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
have gone extinct.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.160
It is common for hominids to evolve.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.160
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:57.160
erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.160
and Homo sapiens, all overlap.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.160
The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
not one.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And as you think of the implications of that,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.160
here's a brief history of the universe.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.160
and then you got life about four billion years ago,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.160
and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Ta-dah!

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.160
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.160
is to create what's in this room.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
Maybe not.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.160
(Laughter)

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.160
So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.160
(Laughter)

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.160
I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.160
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
I think most of us are going to glance at it,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160
into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.160
over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.160
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
Thank you very much.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.160
(Applause)
