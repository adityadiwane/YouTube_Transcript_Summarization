00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
and I'm 11 years old.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
First of all, I would like to say

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
all the marketing and advertising

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
on TV, at public schools

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and pretty much everywhere else you look.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
It seems to me like corporations

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
are always trying to get kids, like me,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to get their parents to buy stuff

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
that really isn't good for us or the planet.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
Little kids, especially,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
are attracted by colorful packaging

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and plastic toys.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I must admit, I used to be one of them.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I also used to think that all of our food

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
came from these happy, little farms

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
What I discovered was this is not true.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I began to look into this stuff

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
on the Internet, in books and in documentary films,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
in my travels with my family.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to do something not intended by nature --

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
like taking the DNA of a fish

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
but this is just creepy.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
(Laughter)

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
The seeds are then planted, then grown.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
The food they produce have been proven

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and people have been eating food produced this way

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
since the 1990s.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And most folks don't even know they exist.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Yet almost all the corn we eat

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
has been altered genetically in some way.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And let me tell you,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
corn is in everything.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
called CAFOS.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Laughter)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
made from fossil fuels

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
from growing the same crop over and over again.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
like pesticides and herbicides,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
to kill weeds and bugs.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
or run off into our waterways,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
poisoning our water too.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
so it can travel thousands of miles

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So I ask myself,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
how can I change? How can I change these things?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
This is what I found out.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Now a while back,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I wanted to be an NFL football player.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.260
(Applause)

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Thank you.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
because he grows against the system.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Since I'm home-schooled,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
I went to go hear him speak one day.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
This man, this "lunatic farmer,"

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
or genetically modified seeds.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I want you to know that we can all make a difference

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
by making different choices,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
by buying our food directly from local farmers,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
or our neighbors who we know in real life.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
but is it really?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
With all these things I've been learning about the food system,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
or we can pay the hospital.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.260
(Applause)

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
I want you to know that there are farms out there --

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
whose cows do eat grass

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
so I can see up close and personal

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
where the meat I eat comes from.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
I want you to know that I believe

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in every community popping up.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
actually like eating baked kale chips.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
I try to share this everywhere I go.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Not too long ago,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
or the sugarcoated flakes --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
My little cousin told his dad

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
one kid at a time.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Thank you.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
(Applause)
