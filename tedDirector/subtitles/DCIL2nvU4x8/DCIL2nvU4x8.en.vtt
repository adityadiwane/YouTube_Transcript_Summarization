00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.711
Scientific breakthrough,

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:17.324
the kind that can potentially save lives,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.388
can sometimes be lying right out in the open

00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:20.950
for us to discover,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.156
in the evolved, accumulated body

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.748
of human anecdote, for example,

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.774
or in the time-tested adaptations

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.236
that we observe in the natural world around us.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.856
Science starts with observation,

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.252
but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.197
that we might otherwise dismiss

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:41.064
as myth or coincidence,

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.917
isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.975
And when we do, the results will often surprise.

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:50.855
Western Australia has had a particular problem

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.070
with shark attacks over the last three years,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.251
unfortunately and tragically culminating

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.331
in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period

00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.091
during that time.

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:03.220
But Western Australia is not alone in this.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.125
The incident of shark engagements on humans

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.469
is escalating worldwide.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.213
And so it's not surprising, perhaps,

00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:11.856
that in July of this year,

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:14.335
Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:17.399
with the University of Western
Australia Oceans Institute

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.173
made an announcement which captured the attention

00:01:20.173 --> 00:01:22.409
of the worldwide media and of ocean users

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200
worldwide,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.931
and that was around the development of technology

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.572
to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:31.720
based on the science of what sharks can see.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.309
And I have for you today

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:35.176
the story of that journey,

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.516
but also the notion that science can be

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:39.981
as powerful as a translator

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.340
as it can be for invention.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.046
When we began this process,

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:48.228
we were looking, it was about three years ago,

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:51.650
and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.421
in Western Australia,

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.628
and by chance, in a previous role,

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.551
I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.258
Now Harry Butler, who most Australians
would know is a famous naturalist,

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:04.593
had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.

00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:06.699
Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.610
to the late Steve Irwin.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.921
When I asked him about

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.219
what the solution to the problem might be,

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.731
the answer was quite surprising.

00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:16.606
He said, "Take a black wetsuit,

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:19.371
band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.659
and you'll be mimicking the warning systems

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.968
of most marine species."

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:25.866
I didn't think about that much at the time,

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.456
and it wasn't until the next three
fatal shark attacks happened,

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:30.890
and it caused me to think,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.021
maybe there's some merit to this idea.

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.486
And I turned to the web

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.741
to see if there might be some clues.

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.018
And it turns out the web is awash

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:41.414
with this sort of evidence that supports

00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:42.976
this sort of thinking.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:44.960
So biologically, there are plenty of species

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.556
that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.258
to either be cryptical in the water

00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.842
or warn against being attacked,

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:53.955
not the least of which is the pilot fish

00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:56.111
which spends a big slab of its life

00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:58.390
around the business end of a shark.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.481
On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.343
has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:05.965
and anthropologically,

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:09.595
Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands

00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:11.376
in a sea snake ceremony

00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:13.970
to ward off the shark god.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.412
So what's going on here?

00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:18.290
Is this an idea lying wide out in the open

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.421
for us to consider and define?

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:25.790
We know that sharks use a range of sensors

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.162
when they engage, particularly for attack,

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:31.122
but the sight sensor is the one that they use

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:32.686
to identify the target, and particularly

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:36.420
in the last number of meters before the attack.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.378
It makes sense to pay attention
to the biological anecdote

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:41.230
because that's time-tested evolution

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.703
over many millennia.

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:47.180
But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.911
the idea that there's a kernel of truth

00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:50.503
thought to be important,

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:53.788
passed down from generation to generation,

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:57.103
so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.763
I wanted to test this idea.

00:03:58.763 --> 00:03:59.981
I wanted to put some science

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.317
to this anecdotal evidence,

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.273
because if science could support this concept,

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:06.368
then we might have at least part of the solution

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:09.426
to shark attack right under our very nose.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:11.221
To do that, I needed some experts

00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:13.074
in shark vision and shark neurology,

00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:14.883
and a worldwide search, again,

00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:16.322
led to the University of W.A.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.725
on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.322
And professor Nathan Hart and his team

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:23.982
had just written a paper which tells us,

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:26.334
confirms that predatory sharks see

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:29.197
in black and white, or grayscale.

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:31.000
So I called up Nathan,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.866
a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.747
that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:38.253
to produce a wetsuit to try and
mitigate the risk of shark attack,

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:40.425
and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:42.887
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.511
supported by the West Australian State Government.

00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.070
And we did three key things.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.790
The first is that we mapped the characteristics,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.810
the physical characteristics of the eyes

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.748
of the three main predatory sharks,

00:04:54.748 --> 00:04:58.466
so the great white, tiger and bull shark.

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.020
We did that genetically

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.920
and we did that anatomically.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.762
The next thing we did was to understand,

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:06.197
using complex computer modeling,

00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:08.251
what that eye can see

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.020
at different depths, distances,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.261
light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.451
And from there, we were able to pinpoint

00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.251
two key characteristics:

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.284
what patterns and shapes would present the wearer

00:05:20.284 --> 00:05:23.516
as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:25.012
and what patterns and shapes might provide

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:27.933
the greatest contrast but provide the greatest

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:29.390
breakup of profile

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.034
so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:35.387
or shark food.

00:05:35.387 --> 00:05:37.579
The next thing we needed to do was to convert this

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:40.328
into wetsuits that people might actually wear,

00:05:40.328 --> 00:05:42.950
and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.180
a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.542
and in fact the guy that designed
the original Quiksilver logo,

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:50.827
to come over and sit with the science team

00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:54.423
and interpret that science

00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:57.565
into aesthetic wetsuits that
people might actually wear.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.021
And here's an example of one of the first drawings.

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.025
So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:07.294
So this takes that banding idea,

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:09.880
takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.885
provides a highly disruptive profile,

00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:13.712
and is intended to prevent the shark

00:06:13.712 --> 00:06:16.380
from considering that you would be ordinary food,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.726
and potentially even create confusion for the shark.

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:23.501
And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.114
You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:28.841
and it's particularly better for the surface,

00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:31.689
where being backlit and providing a silhouette

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.301
is problematic.

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:36.209
Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.820
or the one which attempts to hide the wearer

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.310
in the water column.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.000
There are three panels on this suit,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.624
and in any given conditions,

00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:43.979
one or more of those panels

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.569
will match the reflective spectra of the water

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.168
so as to disappear fully or partially,

00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:51.360
leaving the last panel or panels

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.247
to create a disruptive profile in the water column.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.412
And this one's particularly well-suited

00:06:56.412 --> 00:06:58.859
to the dive configuration,

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:01.927
so when you're deeper under the water.

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:03.637
So we knew that we had

00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:05.407
some really solid science here.

00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:07.033
We knew, if you wanted to stand out,

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:08.205
you needed to look stripy,

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:09.629
and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.181
you needed to look like this.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.007
But the acid test is always going to be,

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:14.339
how would sharks really behave

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.070
in the context of these patterns and shapes.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.381
And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:21.929
in the water with a predatory shark

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:23.295
in a natural environment

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.247
is actually a lot harder than you might think.

00:07:25.247 --> 00:07:28.598
(Laughter)

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:31.164
So we have to bait the rig,

00:07:31.164 --> 00:07:32.708
because we need to get the statistical number

00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:35.732
of samples through to get the scientific evidence,

00:07:35.732 --> 00:07:36.521
and by baiting the rig,

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.750
we're obviously changing shark behavior.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.567
We can't put humans in the water.

00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:43.453
We're ethically precluded from even using

00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:46.100
humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.372
But nevertheless, we started the testing process

00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:50.220
in January of this year,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.356
initially with tiger sharks

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:54.695
and subsequently with great white sharks.

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.130
The way we did that

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.885
was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.781
wrap it in a neoprene skin,

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.344
and then run two stereo underwater cameras

00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:08.693
to watch how the shark
actually engages with that rig.

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:10.381
And because we use stereo,

00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:13.173
we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is,

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:15.429
what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:17.285
and what its behavior is

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:20.491
in an empirical rather than a subjective way.

00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.979
Because we needed to
preserve the scientific method,

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:24.677
we ran a control rig

00:08:24.677 --> 00:08:28.389
which was a black neoprene rig

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:30.198
just like a normal black wetsuit

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:31.677
against the, what we call,

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.805
SAMS technology rig.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.533
And the results were not just exciting,

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:37.971
but very encouraging,

00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:40.519
and today I would like to just give you a snapshot

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.181
of two of those engagements.

00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.301
So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark

00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.388
engaging the black control rig,

00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:50.729
which it had encountered about

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.689
a minute and a half before.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.210
Now that exact same shark had engaged,

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.040
or encountered this SAMS rig,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.652
which is the Elude SAMS rig,

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:18.831
about eight minutes before,

00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:21.974
and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,

00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:24.779
looking for what it could
smell and sense but not see,

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:27.251
and this was the final engagement.

00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:32.687
Great white sharks are more
confident than the tigers,

00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:34.735
and here you see great white shark

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:36.142
engaging a control rig,

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.975
so a black neoprene wetsuit,

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.559
and going straight to the bottom,

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:42.110
coming up

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.147
and engaging.

00:09:46.257 --> 00:09:48.940
In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.409
this is the banded one,

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:52.350
where it's more tactile,

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.860
it's more investigative,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.494
it's more apprehensive,

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:59.499
and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.

00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:15.600
(Applause)

00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.877
So, it's important for us that all 
the testing is done independently,

00:10:22.877 --> 00:10:25.195
and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.

00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:26.947
It'll be an ongoing process.

00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:29.356
It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.

00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:31.699
It's so important that this concept

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:33.497
is led with the science.

00:10:33.497 --> 00:10:35.741
From the perspective of Shark 
Attack Mitigation Systems,

00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:38.146
we're a biotechnology licensing company,

00:10:38.146 --> 00:10:40.433
so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.

00:10:40.433 --> 00:10:42.713
We'll license others to do that.

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:43.672
But I thought you might be interested

00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:45.673
in seeing what SAMS technology looks like

00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:48.672
embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,

00:10:48.672 --> 00:10:51.888
for the first time, live, worldwide --

00:10:51.888 --> 00:10:53.862
(Laughter) —

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.758
I can show you what biological adaptation,

00:10:56.758 --> 00:11:00.285
science and design looks like in real life.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.182
So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,

00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:04.890
from this side. Where are you, Sam?

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.686
(Applause)

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:08.356
And Eduardo.

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:10.172
(Applause)

00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:12.866
Cheers, mate.

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:14.956
Cheers.

00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:19.920
Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)

00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:22.943
So what have we done here?

00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:25.960
Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.280
and use science as a tool for invention,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.136
we've paid attention to the biological evidence,

00:11:32.136 --> 00:11:33.826
we've put importance to the

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.536
human anecdotal evidence,

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:38.618
and we've used science as a tool

00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:40.021
for translation,

00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:42.248
translation of something that was already there

00:11:42.248 --> 00:11:45.819
into something that we can 
use for the benefit of mankind.

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:47.743
And it strikes me that this idea of science

00:11:47.743 --> 00:11:50.799
as a tool for translation rather than invention

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:53.463
is one that we can apply much more widely than this

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.410
in the pursuit of innovation.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.735
After all, did the Wright brothers

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:59.787
discover manned flight,

00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:02.976
or did they observe the biological fact of flight

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:06.168
and translate that mechanically, replicate it

00:12:06.168 --> 00:12:08.685
in a way that humans could use?

00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:10.219
As for the humble wetsuit,

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:12.160
who knows what oceanwear will look like

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.111
in two years' time, in five years' time

00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:18.203
or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:19.469
I'm guessing there's a fair chance

00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:21.190
it won't be pure black.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.359
Thank you.

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:27.270
(Applause)
