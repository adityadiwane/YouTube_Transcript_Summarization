00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.060
(Dominoes fall)

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.956
(Toy car)

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.300
(Ball rolls)

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.540
(Music: "This Too Shall Pass")

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.236
(Singing)

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.556
You know you can't keep
letting it get you down,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.620
and you can't keep dragging
that dead weight around.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.556
If there ain't all that much to lug around

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.180
better run like hell
when you hit the ground

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.740
When the morning comes

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.860
When the morning comes

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.356
You can't stop these kids from dancing,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.796
but why would you want to,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.596
especially when you're
already getting yours?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.556
(Xylophone)

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.956
(Singing) 'Cause if your mind
don't move and your knees don't bend,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.580
well don't go blaming the kids again.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.676
(Xylophone)

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900
(Singing) When the morning comes

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.980
When the morning comes

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.900
When the morning comes

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.900
When the morning comes

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.820
When the morning comes

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.900
When the morning comes

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.980
(Xylophone)

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.756
(Singing) Let it go,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.340
this too shall pass

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.716
Let it go,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.556
this too shall pass

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.156
You know you can't keep
letting it get you down,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.996
you can't keep letting it get you down --

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.780
this too shall pass

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.996
If there ain't
all that much to lug around,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.236
you can't keep letting it get you down --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.716
this too shall pass

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.556
When the morning comes --

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.836
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.716
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.476
When the morning comes --

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.876
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.756
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.596
When the morning comes --

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.876
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.796
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.676
When the morning comes --

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.916
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.796
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.260
When the morning comes

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.876
(Paint guns fire)

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.820
(Applause)

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.596
Damian Kulash:
Thank you, thanks very much.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.476
We are OK Go,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.236
and we've been together
as a band since 1998.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.516
But in the last decade,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.556
we've become known as much
for the elaborate music videos,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.836
like the one we just saw,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.476
as for the songs they accompany.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.596
So we will play along with another
one of those in a few minutes,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.836
but in the meantime,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.196
we want to address this question
that we get asked all the time

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.196
but we've really never come up
with an adequate answer for it,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.740
and that is, how do we
think of those ideas?

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.956
The videos are not all
Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.075
Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.875
and once we set up an obstacle course

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:34.636
out of thousands of musical
instruments in the desert,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.356
and then played them
by stunt driving a car through them.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.396
(Laughter)

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.676
For one of the videos,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.076
we choreographed
hundreds of people with umbrellas

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.476
in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.316
and then filmed them from a drone
a half a mile in the air.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.956
So it's all of these ideas
that people are curious about,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.236
and the reason we've had so much trouble
describing how we think of these ideas

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.660
is that it doesn't really feel
like we think of them at all.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.780
It feels like we find them.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.676
And by way of explanation --

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.876
well, I have a compulsive habit.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.956
I play parallax and perspective games
with my eyes pretty much all the time,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.716
and it's something I've been doing
since I was a teenager.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.476
And I think the big contributing
factor may have been

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.076
that this is how I decorated
my high school bedroom.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.716
(Laughter)

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.996
And being a teenager,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.756
what I did in there, of course,
was just talk on the phone

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.956
for staggering amounts of time.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.356
So I was in this visual maelstrom

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.556
just pretty much
usually sitting in one place,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.356
and I guess just
the overload in general --

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.556
my brain kind of tried
to make sense of it, and I would --

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.076
If I could move my head off
to one side a little bit,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.436
the edge of the desk
would line up just perfectly

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.276
with that poster on the opposite wall;

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.556
or if I put my thumb out,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.956
I could close first my left eye
and then my right,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.916
and my thumb would bounce back and forth

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.116
between Jimi Hendrix's
left eye and his right.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.356
(Laughter)

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.716
It was not a conscious thing, of course,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.996
this is just kind of the equivalent
of doodling while you're talking,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.116
and it's still something
I do all the time.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.476
This is my wife, Kristin --

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.676
(Applause)

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.156
Yeah!

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.380
Woo!

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.716
And it's not uncommon
that we are out at dinner,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.156
and in the middle of a great conversation
she'll just stop mid-sentence,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.596
and when she stops is when I realize
that I'm the one who's acting weird

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.436
because I'm like bobbing and weaving.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.036
And what I'm trying to do
is get that ficus back there

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.036
to stick out of her head like a ponytail.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.660
(Laughter)

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.316
The point of telling you
all this is that --

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.716
for me this is what it feels like
to have an idea.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.276
It's like they're made
of these disparate parts,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.676
these disparate chunks
sort of floating out there.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.756
And if you're receptive
and you're observant,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.356
and crucially, if you're
in exactly the right place,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.620
you can get them to just line up.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.516
So if you get used to --

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.076
if it's your job
to think of ideas this way,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.356
they'll start beckoning to you

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.796
the way that Jimi's eyes
beckoned from that poster,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.436
or the ficus beckons
from behind Kristin's head.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.436
Writing music feels like that process
just over and over again,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.836
like you've got a bunch of sounds
or a groove or a chord progression

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.556
and you're just looking
for that thing on the other side,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.156
that little chunk over there,
that puzzle piece that clicks right in.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.516
And when it does click,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.196
it doesn't feel like you
thought up that puzzle piece,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.876
it feels like you found it --

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.260
like it was a set of relationships
that you unlocked.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.196
But with the videos in particular,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.436
we're usually looking
for this specific feeling

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.716
which is wonder.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.636
And there's always a component
of surprise to wonder,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.996
so we're not just looking for good ideas,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.740
we're looking for good ideas
that surprise us in some way.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.476
And this causes something of a problem,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.700
because ...

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.476
the process that we all use to make stuff,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.036
it actually has a very strong bias
against surprising ideas.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.716
The process I'm talking about
is the one you all know --

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.996
we all do it all the time.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.436
You think of an idea.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.596
You just sit and think
of your brilliant idea

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.196
and then you come up with a plan

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.396
for how you're going to make
that idea happen.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.996
And then with that plan in mind,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.236
you go back and double-check
your original idea

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.516
and maybe revise it,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.516
and then bouncing back and forth
between the idea and the plan,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.756
the plan and the idea,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.996
eventually you come up
with a truly great plan.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.076
And then once you have that,
and only then,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.236
do you go out and you execute.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.916
And this is like --

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.236
this is sort of a flawless system

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.236
in terms of maximizing your resources,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.140
because this -- super cheap.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.116
Thinking usually costs very little,

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.316
but this is really expensive
most of the time,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.756
so by the time you get there,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.836
you want to make sure
you're super prepared

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.676
and you can squeeze every last drop
out of what you've got.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.316
But there are problems with this,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.900
and math will help us
reveal the biggest one.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.236
Go back to that video
that we just showed you.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.996
That Rube Goldberg machine,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.316
it had about 130 interactions in it.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.020
That was 130 things

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.835
that we had to have go
according to our plan.

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:58.716
So let's assume that we want
to make a new video now,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.780
similarly complex -- 130 moving parts.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.156
If we're really good planners
in that system,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.436
it seems like maybe
we could be good enough

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.660
to get every part of that system
to be 90 percent reliable.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.596
90 percent sounds good, right?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.876
Well, it's not.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.196
It's terrible actually.
The numbers say so.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.956
The chance of getting all 130 things
to not fail at the same time

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.236
is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.156
So calculate that out and you get ...

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.716
(Ding)

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.316
.000001,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.796
which is one ten-thousandth
of one percent,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.596
so your chance for success
is literally one in a million.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.236
(Whistle)

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.956
(Laughter)

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.436
I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.436
so let's ratchet up
that reliability to 99 percent.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.316
.99 to the 130th power is ...

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.476
(Ding)

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.436
.27 -- 27 percent.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.036
Significantly less daunting --

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.556
like this might even be usable.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.956
But really think about that.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.316
How many parts of your lives
are 99 percent reliable?

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.460
And could you really get 130 of them
all in one place at once?

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.460
And if you really could,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.796
doesn't it seem
like you deserve to succeed?

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.316
Like that is --

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.036
that thing is going to work, right?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.476
But no, it actually fails three times
more often than it succeeds.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.196
So the upshot of all this

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.436
is that if your project
is pretty complex --

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.556
like, you know,
every ambitious project is --

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.316
if you've got a lot of moving parts,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.956
you're basically constrained
to just reshuffling ideas

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.180
that have already demonstrably
proven that they're 100 percent reliable.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.356
So now go back to me sitting
with my thumb in the air

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.436
trying to line up something surprising.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.556
If the only things I'm allowed
to consider in the first place

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.676
are ideas that have already been done
over and over and over again,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.220
I am screwed.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.556
However, there are ways around this,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.996
because we all know that there are
tons of untried ideas still out there,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.676
and plenty of them will turn out
to be every bit as reliable as we need,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.076
it's just that we don't yet know
they are reliable

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.036
when we are at this planning phase.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.756
So what we do is we try
to identify some place

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.956
where there might just be
a ton of those untried ideas.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.196
We try to find a sandbox

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.756
and then we gamble
a whole bunch of our resources

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.596
on getting in that sandbox and playing.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.236
(Laughter)

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.276
Because we have to trust
that it's the process in the sandbox

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.156
that will reveal to us
which ideas are not only surprising,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.396
but surprisingly reliable.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.060
So some of the sandboxes
that we've started videos with.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.996
Let's play with optical illusions.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.516
Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.340
Let's try to make toast
with a laser cutter.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.196
Or let's do something in one
of those zero-gravity airplanes.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.476
But then instead
of actually trying to sit there

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.316
and think out what that something is,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.276
we spent a full third of our budget
getting in an actual Vomit Comet

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.420
and bouncing off the walls for a week.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.916
So this may seem to you like testing,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.556
but it really isn't,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.516
because at this point
we don't yet know what our idea is,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.276
we don't have a plan to be testing.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.796
So we're just --

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.036
we're just playing,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.196
we're just trying everything
we can think of,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.316
because we need to get this idea space
filled up with a chaos

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.476
like the one in my high school bedroom.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.436
Because then, if we can
do the bob and weave thing,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.476
if we can put our thumbs up
and get just a few things to line up --

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.716
(Ding)

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.074
chances are no one else has ever made
those same things line up before.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.916
And when we're done with that project,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.436
people will ask us again
how we thought of that idea,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.876
and we'll be stumped,
because from our perspective,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.036
it doesn't feel like
we thought of it at all,

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.596
it just feels like we found it.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.796
So we'll play another video for you now
and the song along with it.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.676
This is for the song "The One Moment,"

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.540
and for this one,
the sandbox was ballistics and math.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.516
So I spent a full month putting together
a giant spreadsheet for this.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.676
It was like my playspace
was 400 lines long

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.460
and 25 columns wide --

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.036
which I presume that if anybody is going
to understand that, it's this crowd.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.316
(Laughter)

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.716
Nothing is better
than a giant spreadsheet, right?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.956
(Laughter)

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.716
Well, thank you everyone, very much.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.956
We are OK Go,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.716
and this is called "The One Moment."

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.740
(Applause)

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.980
[The One Moment]

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.140
(Explosions)

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.276
[What you just saw was real

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.556
and it took 4.2 seconds]

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.260
(Video) Let me know when it's safe.

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:43.556
(Percussion)

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.156
[Here's the same moment ...

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.236
slowed down.]

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.380
(Music)

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.820
(Guitar)

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.996
(Singing) You're right,

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.260
there's nothing more lovely,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.380
there's nothing more profound

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.076
than the certainty,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.620
than the certainty
that all of this will end

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.900
That all of this will end

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.356
So open your arms to me,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.076
open your arms to me

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.716
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.476
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.396
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.476
and this will be
the one moment that matters --

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.916
Oh ...

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.940
(Guitar)

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.420
(Singing) So while the mud
reclaims our footprints,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.660
and while our bones keep looking back

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.700
at the overgrowth
that's swallowing the path --

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.620
but for the grace of God go we,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.460
but for the grace of God go we

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.276
But for the grace of time and chance
and entropy's cruel hands --

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.436
So open your arms to me,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.276
open your arms to me

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.876
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.756
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.596
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.636
and this will be
the one moment that matters

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.860
Oh ...

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.516
So won't you stay here with me

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.500
and we'll build
'til we've blistered our hands

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.396
So won't you stay here with me
and we'll build us some temples,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.396
build us some castles,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.076
build us some monuments

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.796
and burn them all right down

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.860
(Music)

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.940
(Singing) So open your arms to me

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.076
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.996
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.836
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.996
and this will be
the one moment that matters

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.916
So won't you stay here with me,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.196
we'll build 'til we blister our hands

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.356
And this will be
the one moment that matters --

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.836
So won't you stay here with me
and build us some temples --

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.796
This will be the one
moment that matters --

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.396
Build us some temples --

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.276
The one moment that matters --

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.276
Build us some monuments --

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.316
The one moment that matters

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.116
Build us some temples --

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.356
The one moment that matters.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.836
Build us some monuments --

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.716
The one moment that matters, oh

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.500
(Guitar)

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.419
(Applause)
