00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.572
I was about 10 years old

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:16.271
on a camping trip with my dad

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.031
in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area

00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.026
in the northern part of New York State.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:23.467
It was a beautiful day.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.469
The forest was sparkling.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.993
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:32.198
and if it weren't for the path we were following,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.602
we could almost pretend we were

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.164
the first human beings to ever walk that land.

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.815
We got to our campsite.

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:40.782
It was a lean-to on a bluff

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:43.478
looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,

00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:46.174
when I discovered a horror.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:49.272
Behind the lean-to was a dump,

00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:50.730
maybe 40 feet square

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.043
with rotting apple cores

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:54.790
and balled-up aluminum foil,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.539
and a dead sneaker.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.110
And I was astonished,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.542
I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.124
The campers who were too lazy

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:06.082
to take out what they had brought in,

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:09.927
who did they think would clean up after them?

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:11.836
That question stayed with me,

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:13.803
and it simplified a little.

00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:16.179
Who cleans up after us?

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.601
However you configure

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.308
or wherever you place the us,

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:21.898
who cleans up after us in Istanbul?

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.154
Who cleans up after us in Rio

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:26.683
or in Paris or in London?

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:28.255
Here in New York,

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.847
the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,

00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:33.517
to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage

00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:37.879
and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.512
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:43.358
I wanted to understand who takes the job.

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:45.877
What's it like to wear the uniform

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:47.531
and bear that burden?

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.184
So I started a research project with them.

00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.723
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.132
and interviewed people in offices and facilities

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:56.639
all over the city,

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.378
and I learned a lot,

00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:00.727
but I was still an outsider.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:02.605
I needed to go deeper.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:05.721
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.

00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.368
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:11.513
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:13.412
It was a remarkable privilege

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:16.019
and an amazing education.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.171
Everyone asks about the smell.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.231
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:22.745
and on days when it is really bad,

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.421
you get used to it rather quickly.

00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:28.618
The weight takes a long time to get used to.

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:30.905
I knew people who were several years on the job

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:33.490
whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.571
of bearing on your body

00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.550
tons of trash every week.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.734
Then there's the danger.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.206
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.408
sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.300
occupations in the country,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.051
and I learned why.

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.472
You're in and out of traffic all day,

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.433
and it's zooming around you.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.317
It just wants to get past you, so it's often

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:55.367
the motorist is not paying attention.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.193
That's really bad for the worker.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:02:59.353
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.372
that often fly back out of the truck

00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:03.453
and do terrible harm.

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:06.268
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:07.579
When you step off the curb

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.428
and you see a city from behind a truck,

00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:12.214
you come to understand that trash

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.831
is like a force of nature unto itself.

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.287
It never stops coming.

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:20.766
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.811
It must always be in motion.

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:25.859
And then there's the stigma.

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.775
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.079
until someone is upset with you for whatever reason

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.394
like you've blocked traffic with your truck,

00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:36.045
or you're taking a break too close to their home,

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:39.159
or you're drinking coffee in their diner,

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.569
and they will come and scorn you,

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.831
and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.263
I find the stigma especially ironic,

00:03:47.263 --> 00:03:50.574
because I strongly believe that sanitation workers

00:03:50.574 --> 00:03:52.254
are the most important labor force

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:55.278
on the streets of the city, for three reasons.

00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:58.060
They are the first guardians of public health.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.466
If they're not taking away trash

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:02.740
efficiently and effectively every day,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.451
it starts to spill out of its containments,

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:09.177
and the dangers inherent to it threaten us

00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:10.351
in very real ways.

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.322
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.228
burst forth again and start to harm us.

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:17.900
The economy needs them.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.826
If we can't throw out the old stuff,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:22.716
we have no room for the new stuff,

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:24.785
so then the engines of the economy

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.714
start to sputter when consumption is compromised.

00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:31.778
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:33.766
And then there's what I call

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:37.978
our average, necessary quotidian velocity.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.027
By that I simply mean

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.279
how fast we're used to moving

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.411
in the contemporary day and age.

00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:48.755
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.392
our coffee cup, our shopping bag,

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:52.877
our bottle of water.

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.556
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,

00:04:55.556 --> 00:04:57.336
because we know there's a workforce

00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:00.356
on the other side that's going to take it all away.

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:02.803
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:07.317
to think about sanitation that will perhaps help

00:05:07.317 --> 00:05:09.791
ameliorate the stigma

00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.022
and bring them into this conversation

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:17.612
of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.

00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:21.773
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.

00:05:21.773 --> 00:05:24.234
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.

00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:26.295
They wear a uniform in many cities.

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:28.164
You know when to expect them.

00:05:28.164 --> 00:05:32.087
And their work lets us do our work.

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:34.878
They are almost a form of reassurance.

00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:36.615
The flow that they maintain

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.605
keeps us safe from ourselves,

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:41.242
from our own dross, our cast-offs,

00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:44.500
and that flow must be maintained always

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.133
no matter what.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:49.857
On the day after September 11 in 2001,

00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:53.144
I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.456
and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs

00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:58.298
and there was a man doing his paper recycling route

00:05:58.298 --> 00:06:00.480
like he did every Wednesday.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.900
And I tried to thank him for doing his work

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.025
on that day of all days,

00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:07.626
but I started to cry.

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:09.310
And he looked at me,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.734
and he just nodded, and he said,

00:06:12.734 --> 00:06:15.612
"We're going to be okay.

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:18.253
We're going to be okay."

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.606
It was a little while later that I started

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:20.986
my research with sanitation,

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:22.400
and I met that man again.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.317
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:27.140
and we became good friends.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.967
I want to believe that Paulie was right.

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:32.169
We are going to be okay.

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.146
But in our effort to reconfigure

00:06:34.146 --> 00:06:37.187
how we as a species exist on this planet,

00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:40.482
we must include and take account of

00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:44.275
all the costs, including the very real human cost

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:45.779
of the labor.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.580
And we also would be well informed

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.798
to reach out to the people who do that work

00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.643
and get their expertise

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:54.396
on how do we think about,

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:57.646
how do we create systems around sustainability

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.125
that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.710
which is a remarkable success across 40 years,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.948
across the United States and countries around the world,

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:09.750
and lift us up to a broader horizon

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.636
where we're looking at other forms of waste

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:14.121
that could be lessened

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.854
from manufacturing and industrial sources.

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:20.859
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:24.857
accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.

00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:27.244
It's a remarkable statistic.

00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:29.722
So in the flow of your days,

00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:31.248
in the flow of your lives,

00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:34.276
next time you see someone whose job is

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:37.419
to clean up after you,

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.908
take a moment to acknowledge them.

00:07:39.908 --> 00:07:44.500
Take a moment to say thank you.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.854
(Applause)
