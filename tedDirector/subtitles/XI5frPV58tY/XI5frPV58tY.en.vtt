00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
We all know the Earth is in trouble.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
We have now entered in the 6X,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
the sixth major extinction on this planet.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
I think that vote is occurring right now.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.330
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
The mycelium infuses all landscapes,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.330
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
so the mycelium is the mother

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
I'm in love with the old-growth forest,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
When I mention mushrooms to somebody,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
We call it mycophobia,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.330
the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Day 21, day 23, day 25.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
We share in common the same pathogens.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.330
and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
After they sporulate, they do rot.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
that occur on rotting mushrooms

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
are essential for the health of the forest.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
They give rise to the trees,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
And the spores are germinating,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
and the mycelium forms and goes underground.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.330
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
And notice that as the mycelium grows,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
it conquers territory and then it begins the net.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
I have thousands of electron micrographs,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
and when I'm staring at the mycelium,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.330
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.330
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.330
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330
and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
These are little wells.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.330
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
but sets up a microbial universe

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.330
that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
I first proposed, in the early 1990s,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.330
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
because of the nodes of crossing --

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.330
there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.330
The mycelium is sentient.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
It knows that you are there.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
When you walk across landscapes,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.330
it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
is an inevitable consequence

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
of a previously proven, biologically successful model.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.330
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
and we now, being the top organism on this planet,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.330
are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
I believe matter begets life;

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
strings become chains; chains network.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
and plants followed several hundred million years later.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
How is that possible?

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.330
It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
and many other acids and enzymes,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
and forming calcium oxalates.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.330
Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
So, fungi and mycelium

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.330
sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
And all sorts of other oxalates

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.330
that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
This was first discovered in 1859.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.330
420 million years ago, this organism existed.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
It was called Prototaxites.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.330
Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.330
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.330
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
published an article in the Journal of Geology

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.330
this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
a giant mushroom.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
All across most land masses.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
And these existed for tens of millions of years.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.330
we had an asteroid impact.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
The Earth was struck by an asteroid,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.330
Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.330
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
because fungi do not need light.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
More recently, at Einstein University,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.330
they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
much like plants use light.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
I think, is a forgone conclusion,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.330
at least in my own mind.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.330
2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.330
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.330
How is it that this organism can be so large,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and yet be one cell wall thick,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.330
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
We were involved with several experiments.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
I'm going to show you six, if I can,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
solutions for helping to save the world.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.330
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.330
one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
one pile was treated with bacteria;

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
The mycelium absorbs the oil.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
The mycelium is producing enzymes --

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.330
and then, when we returned six weeks later,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.330
all the tarps were removed,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
We came back to our pile, it was covered

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.330
with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
and the color changed to a light form.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
They're very large.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
They sporulated, the spores attract insects,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.330
the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
Birds then came, bringing in seeds,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
and our pile became an oasis of life.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.330
and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.330
went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330
The last image we don't have.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.330
The entire pile was a green berm of life.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
These are gateway species,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.330
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.330
So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
or a factory with chemical toxins,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
and it leads to habitat restoration.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
And I'll show you a graph here.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.330
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.330
and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.330
In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.330
reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
Think of the implications.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.330
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.330
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
This is my wife Dusty,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
as a treatment against consumption.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
May not seem that large --

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
let's get closer.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
This is extremely rare fungus.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
We found one sample to be able to get into culture.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.330
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.330
I think is absolutely critical for human health.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.330
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.330
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.330
and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
And a few years ago,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.330
we received these results.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.330
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
that were highly active against poxviruses.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
10 or greater are considered to be very active.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
There's a vetted press release that you can read --

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
it's vetted by DOD --

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.330
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.330
So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
highly active against flu viruses.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
Here's the selectivity index numbers --

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
compared to the ribavirin controls,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.330
we have an extraordinarily high activity.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
And we're using a natural extract

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.330
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
as well as flu B viruses.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
So then we tried a blend,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.330
and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.330
and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.330
(Applause)

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.330
I then think that we can make the argument

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
that we should save the old-growth forest

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
as a matter of national defense.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.330
(Applause)

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.330
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
fungi that kill insects.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.330
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
with metarhizium species of a group of fungi

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
I did something that nobody else had done.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
These are spores -- this is in their spores.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
I was able to morph the culture

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
into a non-sporulating form.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
But the insects aren't stupid,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
and they would avoid the spores when they came close,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
were making debris fields, every day,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
because there's no spores.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.330
They gave it to the queen.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:04.330
And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
the mycelium is consumed by the ants,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.330
they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.330
(Laughter)

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.330
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.330
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.330
So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
And so my house came down, I received my first patent

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
we can steer insects to different directions.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
This has huge implications.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.330
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
It covers over 200,000 species.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
This is the most disruptive technology --

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
that they have ever witnessed.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.330
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.330
prior to sporulation, attract the very insects

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
that are otherwise repelled by those spores.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.330
And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.330
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
you add soil, you add water,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.330
you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
like of the Agarikon mushroom.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.330
And then you put tree seeds in here,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.330
and then you end up growing -- potentially --

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.330
an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.330
I want to reinvent the delivery system,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
and the use of cardboard around the world,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
so they become ecological footprints.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
you could make it interactive, zip code specific --

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
where people could join together,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.330
and through satellite imaging systems,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.330
you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
corns, beans and squash and onions.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.330
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
and I ended up growing a seed garden.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
Then you harvest the seeds --

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.330
and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
and then you're harvesting the seed garden.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.330
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.330
I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
Now, three corncobs, no other grain --

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
lots of mushrooms begin to form.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.330
and so this population will be shut down.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
But watch what happens here.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.330
The mushrooms then are harvested,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.330
but very importantly,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.330
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
And we came up with Econol.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:04.330
Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:12.330
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:16.330
and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
about the generation of fuels.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.330
These are a species that we need to join with.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:29.330
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.330
Thank you very much.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.330
(Applause)
