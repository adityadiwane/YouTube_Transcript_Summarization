00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.160
As an architect you design for the present,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
with an awareness of the past,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.160
for a future which is essentially unknown.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and issue of the day.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
And I'd like to share some experience

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.160
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.160
and to explore and to touch on some observations

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.160
about the nature of sustainability.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
what are the threats, what are the possibilities,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
the challenges, the opportunities?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.160
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.160
before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.160
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
that really, green is cool.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.160
by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
which determine the quality of life.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
I rarely actually quote anything,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.160
so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.160
[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160
about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.160
who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
He said,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
We reached a tipping point this year

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
came to be understood by a critical mass

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and competitive thing they could do.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:08.160
"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And I think it was July 20, 1969,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
in Space City and other places in Russia.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And interestingly, as I think back,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
they were the first true environmentalists.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And at that period it was --

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
in a way, a number of things were happening.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.160
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
again, a word that had not been coined.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
It's another subject. It's another conversation.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
It was at that time, with an awareness

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160
fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.160
that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
And it's a number of projects.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.160
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
for one of the Canary Islands.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
And this probably coincided with the time

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and you had the hippie movement.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
which seeks to sum up the recommendations.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
And all the components are there which are now

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
in common parlance, in our vocabulary,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
you know, 30-odd years later:

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And in parallel at that time, there was

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.160
a very kind of exclusive design club.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
People who were really design conscious

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
and the objects that he would create

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
for the company called Braun.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
And despite Bucky's prophecies

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
that everything would be miniaturized

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
and technology would make an incredible style --

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
access to comfort, to amenities --

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
it was very, very difficult to imagine

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
that everything that we see in this image,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
would be very, very stylishly packaged.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160
And I think that that digital revolution

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
now is coming to the point

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.160
where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
finally connects with the physical world,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.160
there is the reality that that has become humanized,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.160
so that digital world has all the friendliness,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.160
all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Probably summed up in a way

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
by the stylish or alternative available here,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
as we generously had gifted at lunchtime,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
A very, very beautiful object.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
And the reference to the iPod as iconic,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.160
the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.160
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves --

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Buildings are important, but

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
they're only a component of a much bigger picture.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
if you could achieve the impossible,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
the equivalent of perpetual motion,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
you could design a carbon-free house, for example.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
That would be the answer.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
It's only the beginning of the problem.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
You cannot separate the buildings out

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
from the infrastructure of cites

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
and the mobility of transit.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.160
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
and we look at planet Earth,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
then the energy consumed would be split

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.160
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
But again, that only shows part of the picture.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
then 70 percent of the energy consumption

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:48.160
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160
So the problems of sustainability

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.160
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
of which the buildings are a part.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.160
between a recent kind of city,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.160
and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
The city goes out in annular rings,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
consuming more and more green space,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.160
and more and more roads, and more and more energy

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
in the transport of people between the city center --

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.160
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.160
and Munich is not a bad example of that,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.160
then a city which is really only twice as dense,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
is only using one-tenth of the energy.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
In other words, you take these comparable examples

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and the energy leap is enormous.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.160
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160
that as the density increases along the bottom there,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160
that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
social diversity, mass transit,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.160
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
the quality of civic spaces.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.160
is not dense compared with the really dense cities.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
which were occurring in the developing world.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
And now, out of typically 46 cities,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.160
33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
for example, China or India.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
you can see on that traffic system,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.160
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.160
as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.160
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
1,000 new cars every day --

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.160
statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:58.160
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:05.160
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:12.160
So, if we think of the transition in our society

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.160
then that same process is happening in 20 years.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.160
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:35.160
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.160
over that period where the urbanization has trebled.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
If I pull back from that global picture,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.160
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
is a tool for designers,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160
and I cite our own experience as a company,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.160
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.160
then how do you measure that change of technology?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
How does it affect the design of buildings?

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And particularly, how can it lead

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
create less pollution and are more socially responsible?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.160
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
for a company called Willis and Faber,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.160
in a small market town in the northeast of England,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
commuting distance with London.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
And here, the first thing you can see

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.160
is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160
which is also about the celebration of public space.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.160
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.160
encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
you have a connection with nature.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.160
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.160
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.160
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.160
it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160
Now this was 1973.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160
In 2001, this building received an award.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
And the award was about a celebration for a building

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.160
which had been in use over a long period of time.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
And the people who'd created it came back:

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160
the project managers, the company chairmen then.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160
And they were saying, you know,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
"The architects, Norman was always going on about

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
designing for the future, and you know,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
it didn't seem to cost us any more.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
So we humored him, we kept him happy."

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
The image at the top,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160
really what it is saying is you can wire this building.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
This building was wired for change.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.160
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.160
had to build new buildings for the new technology.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
We were fortunate,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
because in a way our building was future-proofed.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:51.160
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Round about that design period leading up to this building,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
and we really don't have the immediate expertise

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.160
at a technical level."

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
In other words, we didn't have the technology

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160
to do what would be really interesting on that building.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.160
a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.160
would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
is very much a pioneering building.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.160
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.160
is that the technology is now available and celebratory.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.160
The library of the Free University, which opened last year,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
is an example of that.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
of sketches and computer images to the reality.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
And a combination of devices here,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.160
the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
which enables the building to be ventilated,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.160
to consume dramatically less energy,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160
and where it's really working with the forces of nature.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.160
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160
by the people who use it.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.160
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:39.160
and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.160
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.160
And you can measure the performance,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
in terms of energy consumption, of that building

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
against a typical library.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
If I show another aspect of that technology

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.160
then, in a completely different context --

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.160
this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.160
but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.160
the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.160
out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.160
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:34.160
the ability to plot points in the sky

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:41.160
and to transmit, to transfer that information

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.160
now, directly into the factory.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.160
So if you cross the border -- just across the border --

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.160
a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
and those points in space are communicated.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
And on the left are the cutting machines,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
which then, in the factory,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.160
enable those individual pieces to be fabricated

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.160
and plus or minus very, very few millimeters,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.160
to be slotted together on site.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.160
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.160
in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:33.160
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.160
And again, the way in which that works as a building,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.160
for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.160
to live and visit there.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.160
If I made the leap into these new technologies,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
then how did we -- what happened before that?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.160
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.160
the things that you take for granted?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.160
Well, obviously the building still happened.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.160
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.160
which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160
deep into the heart of this space here.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.160
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:29.160
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.160
in a wind tunnel and blast air,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.160
and the many kilometers of cable and so on.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.160
And the turning point was probably, in our terms,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.160
when we had the first computer.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
And that was at the time that we sought

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.160
to redesign, reinvent the airport.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.160
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.160
big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.160
lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.160
And Stansted, the green alternative,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160
which uses natural light, is a friendly place:

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.160
you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.160
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light --

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.160
electric light, which in turn creates more heat,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.160
which creates more cooling loads and so on.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.160
And at that particular point in time,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.160
this was one of the few solitary computers.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.160
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.160
Not going back very far in time, 1990,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.160
that's our office.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.160
And if you looked very closely, you'd see

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.160
that people were drawing with pencils,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.160
and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.160
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160
I mean, major transformation.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.160
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:12.160
and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:21.160
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.160
which record our archival information

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
on past, current and future projects.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.160
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.160
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.160
But meanwhile, as you know,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.160
wonderful protagonists like Al Gore

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.160
are noting the inexorable rise in temperature,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.160
set in the context of that,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.160
interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.160
and very, very relevant to this place.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.160
Our Reichstag project,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.160
which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.160
as a public place where we sought to, in a way,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.160
through a process of advocacy,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.160
reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.160
public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto --

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.160
something that would be free, completely free

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.160
of fuel as we know it.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.160
So it would be totally renewable.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.160
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.160
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.160
But here, not having to model it for real.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.160
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.160
but the ability now with the computer

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.160
to explore, to plan, to see how that would work

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.160
in terms of the forces of nature:

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.160
natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160
and to look at biomass.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.160
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil --

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.160
a process that, quite interestingly, was developed

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.160
in Eastern Germany, at the time of its

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.160
dependence on the Soviet Bloc.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.160
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.160
which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160
You can measure it again.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.160
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.160
in tons of carbon dioxide per year --

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.160
at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160
what it would have been with natural gas

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.160
and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.160
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.160
We can see the same processes at work

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.160
in terms of the Commerce Bank --

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.160
its dependence on natural ventilation,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160
the way that you can model those gardens,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160
the way they spiral around.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.160
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.160
something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160
And again, we can measure the reduction

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.160
in terms of energy consumption.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.160
There is an evolution here between the projects,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.160
and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.160
the project in the city in London.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.160
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.160
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.160
is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.160
What are the other ways of putting

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.160
the same amount of space on the site?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.160
If, for example, you seek to do a building

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.160
which goes right to the edge of the pavement,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.160
it's the same amount of space.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.160
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.160
The grooves become the kind of green lungs

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.160
which give views, which give light, ventilation,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.160
make the building fresher.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.160
And you enclose that with something that also

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.160
is central to its appearance,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.160
which is a mesh of triangulated structures --

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.160
again, in a long connection evocative of

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.160
some of those works of Buckminster Fuller,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.160
and the way in which triangulation can increase performance

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.160
and also give that building its sense of identity.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.160
And here, if we look at a detail of the way

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.160
the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.160
we can see the high pressure, the low pressure,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.160
the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.160
So it also has the ability, all the time,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.160
regardless of the direction of the wind,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.160
to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.160
And unlike conventional buildings,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.160
the top of the building is celebratory.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.160
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.160
And the base of the building is again about public space.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.160
Comparing it with a typical building,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.160
what happens if we seek to use such design strategies

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.160
in terms of really large-scale thinking?

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.160
And I'm just going to give two images

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:22.160
out of a kind of company research project.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:28.160
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.160
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.160
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.160
than the oceans and seas around it.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.160
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.160
by creating a pipeline, a pipe,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.160
sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:57.160
that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.160
into the Dead Sea.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160
And our translation of that,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.160
using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.160
what if that, instead of being just a pipe,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160
what if it is a lifeline?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.160
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.160
of the Grand Canal,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.160
in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.160
In other words, water is the lifeblood.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.160
And if you just go back to the previous image,

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.160
and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.160
that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.160
could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.160
in a united cause, in terms of something that would be

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.160
genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160
Infrastructure at that large scale is also

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.160
inseparable from communication.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.160
And whether that communication is the virtual world

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160
or it is the physical world,

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.160
then it's absolutely central to society.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.160
And how do we make more legible in this growing world,

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.160
especially in some of the places that I'm talking about --

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160
China, for example, which in the next ten years

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.160
will create 400 new airports.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.160
Now what form do they take?

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.160
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:31.160
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.160
because you always have a point of reference.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:39.160
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.160
into the Chinese society?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.160
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.160
perhaps the ultimate mega-building.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.160
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:59.160
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.160
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.160
at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.160
And the challenge here is a building that will be green,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.160
that is compact despite its size

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.160
and is about the human experience of travel,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.160
is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.160
is very, very much about the lifestyle.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:33.160
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.160
As Hubert was talking over lunch,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.160
as we sort of engaged in conversation,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.160
talked about this, talked about cities.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.160
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.160
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.160
was triggered on New Year's Eve,

00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:00.160
when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.160
in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.160
And I was voicing the thought that --

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.160
it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:15.160
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.160
that maybe, you know, the future was

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.160
the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.160
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160
"We put a man on the moon."

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160
You know, who is going to say

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.160
that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.160
with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.160
And that's a concerted platform.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.160
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.160
I thought that the inspiration was more likely

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.160
to come from those other, larger countries out there --

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.160
the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160
Thank you very much.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160
(Applause)
