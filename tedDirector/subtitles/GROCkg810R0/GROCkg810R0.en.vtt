00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.838
What I want you all to do right now

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:19.029
is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.877
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:26.205
is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:29.267
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.339
they simply will not work.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.029
That's the first thing.

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:38.706
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.860
of this mammal, if we study this mammal,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.422
we're going to get great insight into our diseases

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:50.958
of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.728
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal

00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:00.922
is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:04.977
lies deep within its DNA.

00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:07.285
So are you all thinking?

00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:09.779
So,

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:12.881
magnificent creature, isn't it?

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.233
Who here thought of a bat?

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.864
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me,

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:22.087
and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:26.345
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:30.744
to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:34.506
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat,

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.918
and they have very unique attributes.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:39.946
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:43.929
for about 64 million years.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.394
One of the most unique things that bats do

00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:50.195
as a mammal is that they fly.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.530
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.473
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:

00:01:57.473 --> 00:02:00.833
once in the bats, once in the birds,

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.928
and once in the pterodactyls.

00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:06.774
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:10.704
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:15.090
But one other extremely unique thing about bats

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.139
is that they are able to use sound

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.935
to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.599
Now, what I mean by echolocation --

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.104
they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth

00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:32.000
or through their nose. This sound wave comes out

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.087
and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:38.947
and the bats then hear these echoes

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:42.465
and they turn this information into an acoustic image.

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:47.093
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.

00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:50.518
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:53.713
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:57.654
that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly

00:02:57.654 --> 00:03:00.629
and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.653
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show

00:03:03.653 --> 00:03:06.892
that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.860
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.158
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel

00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:17.663
once said, "To truly experience an alien life form

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:21.403
on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room

00:03:21.403 --> 00:03:25.528
with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."

00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:28.599
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.556
on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:34.350
you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.689
to be able to make sound and perceive it.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.253
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.

00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:46.142
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.416
sound is very important for its survival.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:53.785
Most bats look like the previous one.

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:57.824
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.

00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:00.823
They do not perceive their environment using sound,

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:02.569
and these are the flying foxes.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.839
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.064
you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,

00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:12.249
and if you just look at their face, you can see

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.787
they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:19.309
So among and within bats is a huge variation

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.200
in their ability to use sensory perception.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.253
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going

00:04:24.253 --> 00:04:26.016
to tell you later during the talk.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:31.095
Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,

00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:33.964
and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick

00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:37.168
looking at very large images of bats,

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:40.057
that's probably not that surprising,

00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:42.384
because here in Western culture,

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.141
bats have been demonized.

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.805
Really, of course the famous book "Dracula,"

00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:49.888
written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:51.945
probably is mainly responsible for this.

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:55.025
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact

00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:57.308
that bats come out at night, and we don't

00:04:57.308 --> 00:04:59.960
really understand them. We're a little frightened by things

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.260
that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.319
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.184
They are the perpetrators in horror movies,

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.991
such as this famous "Nightwing."

00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:13.752
Also, if you think about it, demons

00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:17.467
always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically --

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:20.336
or angels have bird wings.

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:25.445
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:30.144
is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:33.073
that they perceive bats as

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:36.657
creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:41.001
into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.

00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:43.183
This is considered the Five Blessings.

00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:45.845
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.936
for "happiness," and they believe that bats

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:53.297
bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.

00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:56.657
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.755
surrounded by five bats.

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:02.438
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you

00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:06.024
and to show you that at least three of these blessings

00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:09.393
are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:13.656
we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.

00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:18.707
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:22.217
Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems

00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:25.889
to function correctly. And why is this?

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.003
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:32.995
They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:37.103
of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating

00:06:37.103 --> 00:06:40.756
the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:43.717
in Mexico. So indeed, we need them

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:46.109
for our ecosystems to function properly.

00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:48.844
Without them, it's going to be a problem.

00:06:48.844 --> 00:06:54.366
But most bats are voracious insect predators.

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:57.242
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony

00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:59.393
of big brown bats, that they will feed

00:06:59.393 --> 00:07:02.963
on over a million insects a year,

00:07:02.963 --> 00:07:05.906
and in the United States of America, right now

00:07:05.906 --> 00:07:09.247
bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.

00:07:09.247 --> 00:07:12.487
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out

00:07:12.487 --> 00:07:16.247
populations of bats, and scientists have estimated

00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:21.204
that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now

00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:24.918
remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.

00:07:24.918 --> 00:07:27.330
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.169
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:32.893
bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.

00:07:32.893 --> 00:07:35.191
They're going to -- They are very threatened

00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:38.736
in the United States of America alone.

00:07:38.736 --> 00:07:40.277
Now how can this help us?

00:07:40.277 --> 00:07:43.942
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:46.336
from the equation, we're going to have to then use

00:07:46.336 --> 00:07:49.277
insecticides to remove all those pest insects

00:07:49.277 --> 00:07:52.352
that feed on our agricultural crops.

00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:56.000
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.942
that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,

00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:03.465
if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.921
They maintain the health of our ecosystems,

00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:08.410
and also they save us money.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.297
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important

00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:13.953
for our ecosystems.

00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:17.953
And what about the second? What about health?

00:08:17.953 --> 00:08:22.615
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.

00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:25.265
Your genome is made up of your DNA,

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:28.457
your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:31.377
and interact and be as you are.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:35.839
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:39.962
it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome

00:08:39.962 --> 00:08:44.091
in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.631
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized

00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:50.448
that there's variations within our genome.

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:53.642
So I want you to look at the person beside you.

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:55.721
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize

00:08:55.721 --> 00:09:00.365
is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:02.630
And one of the grand challenges right now

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.226
in modern molecular medicine is to work out

00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:10.068
whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,

00:09:10.068 --> 00:09:12.979
or does this variation just make you different?

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:15.385
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation

00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:19.204
actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:23.098
new molecular data and personalized genomic information

00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:25.499
that is coming online that we will be able to have

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:28.571
in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate

00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:31.787
between the two. So how do we do this?

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:35.115
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.

00:09:35.115 --> 00:09:39.960
So through natural selection, over time,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.077
mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein

00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:47.698
will not be tolerated over time.

00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:51.892
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.153
And so therefore, if you look at the same region

00:09:54.153 --> 00:09:57.304
of a genome in many mammals that have been

00:09:57.304 --> 00:10:00.808
evolutionarily distant from each other

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:04.271
and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:08.033
understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:11.912
i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:14.232
for its survival, it will be the same

00:10:14.232 --> 00:10:18.983
in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.

00:10:18.983 --> 00:10:22.260
So therefore, if we were to do this,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.729
what we'd need to do is sequence that region

00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:26.844
in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same

00:10:26.844 --> 00:10:30.851
or if it's different. So if it is the same,

00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:33.960
this indicates that that site is important for a function,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.823
so a disease mutation should fall within that site.

00:10:37.823 --> 00:10:41.560
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.824
have a yellow-type genome at that site,

00:10:44.824 --> 00:10:47.486
it probably suggests that purple is bad.

00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:50.960
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.632
that are doing things slightly differently.

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:55.710
So say, for example, the region of the genome

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.239
that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:02.913
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,

00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:06.747
such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well

00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:09.519
have the purple type, we know that this is probably

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.894
what's causing this disease.

00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:17.087
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different

00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:20.435
types of diseases of the senses.

00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:23.243
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?

00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:28.189
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:31.780
45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.995
and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.166
so we want to try and better understand

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.771
which mutations in the gene cause the disease.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:45.679
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:49.195
newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,

00:11:49.195 --> 00:11:52.253
over half of us will also have a hearing problem.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.530
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.177
So what we've been doing in my lab

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:02.291
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.839
and we have looked at genes that cause blindness

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:06.188
when there's a defect in them,

00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:08.731
genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,

00:12:08.731 --> 00:12:13.721
and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.

00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:16.602
So bats are also important for our health,

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:21.492
to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.

00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:23.911
So this is where we are right now,

00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.811
but what about the future?

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.467
What about longevity?

00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:31.208
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before,

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:34.287
I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:35.996
lies within the bat genome.

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:40.112
So why should we be interested in aging at all?

00:12:40.112 --> 00:12:42.600
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.416
of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:50.051
one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,

00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.013
aspects of all of biology, and really,

00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:57.389
since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.

00:12:57.389 --> 00:13:00.434
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.

00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:04.063
In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be

00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:07.878
a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,

00:13:07.878 --> 00:13:11.615
and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.

00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.456
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration

00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:19.218
causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.

00:13:19.218 --> 00:13:23.732
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie

00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:26.413
within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard

00:13:26.413 --> 00:13:30.371
a guess over how long this bat could live for?

00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:33.396
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:37.292
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?

00:13:37.292 --> 00:13:41.144
Some? How about 30?

00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:45.019
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:48.670
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.858
It lived for up to 42 years,

00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:53.193
and this bat's still alive in the wild today.

00:13:53.193 --> 00:13:55.775
But what would be so amazing about this?

00:13:55.775 --> 00:14:00.857
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship

00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:03.357
between body size, metabolic rate,

00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:05.493
and how long you can live for, and you can predict

00:14:05.493 --> 00:14:08.720
how long a mammal can live for given its body size.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.415
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.

00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:15.154
Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.970
As you can see here on this graph, in blue,

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.536
these are all other mammals, but bats

00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:22.704
can live up to nine times longer than expected

00:14:22.704 --> 00:14:25.846
despite having a really, really high metabolic rate,

00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:28.481
and the question is, how can they do that?

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:32.022
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer

00:14:32.022 --> 00:14:34.798
than expected, given their body size, than man,

00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:37.646
and 18 of those are bats.

00:14:37.646 --> 00:14:42.582
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA

00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:45.427
that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:49.333
particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:50.873
than a mammal of the same size,

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:54.485
but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:57.830
So right now, in my lab, we're combining

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.741
state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching

00:15:01.741 --> 00:15:04.550
the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.021
modern molecular technology to understand better

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:12.549
what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:15.709
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:19.308
Aging is a big problem for humanity,

00:15:19.308 --> 00:15:22.244
and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover

00:15:22.244 --> 00:15:25.116
the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:28.325
to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out

00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:31.557
what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,

00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:34.116
we can enable us to do the same thing.

00:15:34.116 --> 00:15:39.392
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.

00:15:39.392 --> 00:15:43.283
Just imagine what that would be like.

00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:46.168
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them

00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:51.222
as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.

00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:55.068
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit

00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.620
if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.526
they allow us to understand how our genome functions,

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.755
and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:06.370
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.869
in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:13.869
I want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)
