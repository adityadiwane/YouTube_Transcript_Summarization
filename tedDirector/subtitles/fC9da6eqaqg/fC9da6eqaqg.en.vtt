00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.695
So a few years ago,

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.656
I did something really brave,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.360
or some would say really stupid.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.160
I ran for Congress.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.776
For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.856
as a fundraiser, as an organizer,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.080
but in my heart, I always wanted to run.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.136
The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.056
She had never lost a race,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.960
and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.536
But in my mind, this was my way

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.056
to make a difference,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200
to disrupt the status quo.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.320
The polls, however,
told a very different story.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.136
My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.080
that there was no way that I could win.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.096
But I ran anyway,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.296
and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.400
I swore I was going to win.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.616
I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.976
the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600
and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.696
I raised money from everyone I knew,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.616
including Indian aunties

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.360
that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.416
But on election day, the polls were right,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.480
and I only got 19 percent of the vote,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.656
and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.096
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.136
on 6,321 votes.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.440
Don't do the math.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.480
It was humiliating.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.976
Now, before you get the wrong idea,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.440
this is not a talk
about the importance of failure.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.680
Nor is it about leaning in.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.616
I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.096
because I was 33 years old

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.856
and it was the first time
in my entire life

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.536
that I had done something
that was truly brave,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.240
where I didn't worry about being perfect.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.096
And I'm not alone:

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.856
so many women I talk to tell me

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.776
that they gravitate
towards careers and professions

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.896
that they know
they're going to be great in,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.296
that they know they're
going to be perfect in,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.136
and it's no wonder why.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.216
Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.016
We're taught to smile pretty,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.560
play it safe, get all A's.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.016
Boys, on the other hand,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.816
are taught to play rough, swing high,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.600
crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.776
And by the time they're adults,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.576
whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.496
they're habituated
to take risk after risk.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.760
They're rewarded for it.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.856
It's often said in Silicon Valley,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.160
no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.416
In other words,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.536
we're raising our girls to be perfect,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.880
and we're raising our boys to be brave.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.760
Some people worry
about our federal deficit,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.600
but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.696
Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.240
because we're not raising
our girls to be brave.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.296
The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.256
in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.840
and pretty much everywhere you look.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.176
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.856
looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.480
that was too difficult for them.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.176
She found that bright girls
were quick to give up.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.920
The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.256
Bright boys, on the other hand,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.976
found the difficult material
to be a challenge.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.736
They found it energizing.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.960
They were more likely
to redouble their efforts.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.920
What's going on?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.016
Well, at the fifth grade level,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.696
girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.856
including math and science,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.720
so it's not a question of ability.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.680
The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.279
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.976
An HP report found
that men will apply for a job

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.640
if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.736
but women, women will apply

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.336
only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.640
100 percent.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.056
This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.800
women need a little more confidence.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.856
But I think it's evidence

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.016
that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.576
and they're overly cautious.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.416
(Applause)

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.496
And even when we're ambitious,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.296
even when we're leaning in,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.536
that socialization of perfection

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.640
has caused us to take
less risks in our careers.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.896
And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.160
in computing and tech,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.696
women are being left behind,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.376
and it means our economy
is being left behind

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.576
on all the innovation and problems
women would solve

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.336
if they were socialized to be brave

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.440
instead of socialized to be perfect.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.896
(Applause)

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.256
So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.336
and what I found
is that by teaching them to code

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.520
I had socialized them to be brave.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.456
Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.656
of trying to get the right command
in the right place,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.096
with sometimes just a semicolon

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.440
making the difference
between success and failure.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.336
Code breaks and then it falls apart,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.776
and it often takes many, many tries

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.096
until that magical moment

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.200
when what you're trying
to build comes to life.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.240
It requires perseverance.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.360
It requires imperfection.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.536
We immediately see in our program

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.896
our girls' fear of not getting it right,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.160
of not being perfect.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.016
Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.016
During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.016
a student will call her over
and she'll say,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.056
"I don't know what code to write."

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.016
The teacher will look at her screen,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.920
and she'll see a blank text editor.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.456
If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.560
spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.576
But if she presses undo a few times,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.320
she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.096
She tried, she came close,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.200
but she didn't get it exactly right.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.656
Instead of showing
the progress that she made,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.640
she'd rather show nothing at all.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.000
Perfection or bust.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.200
It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.031
but it's not enough
just to teach them to code.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.911
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:27.696
and teaches intro to Java

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.400
tells me about his office hours
with computer science students.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.376
When the guys are struggling
with an assignment,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.976
they'll come in and they'll say,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.360
"Professor, there's something
wrong with my code."

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.376
The girls will come in and say,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.440
"Professor, there's something
wrong with me."

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.816
We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.456
but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.320
that lets girls know
that they are not alone.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.040
Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.936
I can't tell you how many women tell me,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.736
"I'm afraid to raise my hand,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.896
I'm afraid to ask a question,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.296
because I don't want to be the only one

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.760
who doesn't understand,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.040
the only one who is struggling.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.736
When we teach girls to be brave

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.056
and we have a supportive network
cheering them on,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.096
they will build incredible things,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.840
and I see this every day.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.136
Take, for instance,
two of our high school students

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.536
who built a game called Tampon Run --

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.016
yes, Tampon Run --

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.456
to fight against the menstruation taboo

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.680
and sexism in gaming.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.416
Or the Syrian refugee

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.960
who dared show her love
for her new country

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.799
by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.015
Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm

00:08:55.039 --> 00:09:00.096
to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.496
in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.080
because he has cancer.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.400
These are just
three examples of thousands,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.216
thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.193
who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance.

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:21.216
And whether they become coders

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.896
or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.240
they will not defer their dreams.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.440
And those dreams have never been
more important for our country.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.456
For the American economy,
for any economy to grow,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.616
to truly innovate,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.840
we cannot leave behind
half our population.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.336
We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.280
and we've got to do it now.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.616
We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.720
when I was 33 years old.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.576
We have to teach them
to be brave in schools

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.336
and early in their careers,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.496
when it has the most potential
to impact their lives

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.536
and the lives of others,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.336
and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.416
not for being perfect

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.080
but for being courageous.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.656
And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know --

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.096
your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague --

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.680
to be comfortable with imperfection,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.856
because when we teach
girls to be imperfect,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.456
and we help them leverage it,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.376
we will build a movement
of young women who are brave

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.776
and who will build
a better world for themselves

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.440
and for each and every one of us.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.376
Thank you.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.320
(Applause)

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.280
Thank you.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.976
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.680
It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.416
Tell me how it's going.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.696
How many girls
are involved now in your program?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.376
Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.936
This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.216
(Applause)

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.296
And that number is really powerful,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.616
because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.216
Like, the problem is so bad

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.720
that we can make
that type of change quickly.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.816
CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.016
who are welcoming
graduates from your program?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.016
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.096
from Twitter to Facebook

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.616
to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.536
I mean, every single company out there.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.976
And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.976
because we need every single tech company

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.776
to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.776
CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.705
that when you mix in more gender balance

00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:02.176
in the engineering teams,
good things happen.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.496
RS: Great things happen.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.936
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.816
that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.896
Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.336
We own the Internet,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.816
and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.016
And I think when companies
have diverse teams,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.456
and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.896
they build awesome things,
and we see it every day.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.656
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.976
This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.216
RS: Thank you.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.080
(Applause)
