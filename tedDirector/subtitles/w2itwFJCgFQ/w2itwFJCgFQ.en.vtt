00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.067
So what does it mean
for a machine to be athletic?

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.884
We will demonstrate the concept
of machine athleticism

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.604
and the research to achieve it

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.486
with the help of these flying machines
called quadrocopters,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.557
or quads, for short.

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.184
Quads have been around for a long time.

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.778
They're so popular these days
because they're mechanically simple.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.644
By controlling
the speeds of these four propellers,

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:49.413
these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:51.608
and accelerate
along their common orientation.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.377
On board are also a battery, a computer,

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.354
various sensors and wireless radios.

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.607
Quads are extremely agile,
but this agility comes at a cost.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.850
They are inherently unstable,

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.445
and they need some form
of automatic feedback control

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.842
in order to be able to fly.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.512
So, how did it just do that?

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:21.291
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.745
serve as an indoor
global positioning system.

00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.340
It's used to locate objects in the space

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:28.452
that have these reflective
markers on them.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.514
This data is then sent to another laptop

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:32.896
that is running estimation
and control algorithms,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.874
which in turn sends commands to the quad,

00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:37.531
which is also running estimation
and control algorithms.

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:44.106
The bulk of our research is algorithms.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.706
It's the magic that brings
these machines to life.

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:52.324
So how does one design the algorithms
that create a machine athlete?

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.379
We use something broadly
called model-based design.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:57.205
We first capture the physics

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.212
with a mathematical model
of how the machines behave.

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.586
We then use a branch of mathematics
called control theory

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.267
to analyze these models

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.061
and also to synthesize
algorithms for controlling them.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.844
For example, that's how we can
make the quad hover.

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:16.158
We first captured the dynamics
with a set of differential equations.

00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:19.634
We then manipulate these equations
with the help of control theory

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.595
to create algorithms
that stabilize the quad.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.423
Let me demonstrate
the strength of this approach.

00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:31.831
Suppose that we want
this quad to not only hover

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.514
but to also balance this pole.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.294
With a little bit of practice,

00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:39.001
it's pretty straightforward
for a human being to do this,

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.216
although we do have the advantage
of having two feet on the ground

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.299
and the use of our very versatile hands.

00:02:44.804 --> 00:02:47.542
It becomes a little bit more difficult

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.545
when I only have one foot on the ground

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.171
and when I don't use my hands.

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.295
Notice how this pole has
a reflective marker on top,

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.980
which means that it can
be located in the space.

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:05.343
(Audience) Oh!

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:06.626
(Applause)

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.363
(Applause ends)

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:14.028
You can notice that this quad
is making fine adjustments

00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:15.426
to keep the pole balanced.

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:18.489
How did we design
the algorithms to do this?

00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:21.108
We added the mathematical
model of the pole

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:22.579
to that of the quad.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:25.581
Once we have a model
of the combined quad-pole system,

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.924
we can use control theory to create
algorithms for controlling it.

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.102
Here, you see that it's stable,

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:34.795
and even if I give it little nudges,

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.985
it goes back --

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.358
to the nice, balanced position.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.477
We can also augment the model

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.872
to include where we want
the quad to be in space.

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:47.371
Using this pointer,
made out of reflective markers,

00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:49.824
I can point to where I want
the quad to be in space

00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:51.445
a fixed distance away from me.

00:03:59.785 --> 00:04:01.665
(Laughter)

00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:10.889
The key to these acrobatic
maneuvers is algorithms,

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:13.206
designed with the help
of mathematical models

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.415
and control theory.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:17.231
Let's tell the quad to come back here

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:18.919
and let the pole drop,

00:04:18.943 --> 00:04:21.074
and I will next demonstrate the importance

00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:23.087
of understanding physical models

00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.156
and the workings of the physical world.

00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:41.290
Notice how the quad lost altitude
when I put this glass of water on it.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.717
Unlike the balancing pole,

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.756
I did not include the mathematical
model of the glass

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.087
in the system.

00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.124
In fact, the system doesn't even know
that the glass is there.

00:04:50.148 --> 00:04:52.886
Like before, I could use
the pointer to tell the quad

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.481
where I want it to be in space.

00:04:57.684 --> 00:04:59.483
(Applause)

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:05.071
(Applause ends)

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:07.254
Okay, you should be asking yourself,

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.340
why doesn't the water
fall out of the glass?

00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:10.918
Two facts.

00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:14.575
The first is that gravity acts
on all objects in the same way.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:16.830
The second is that the propellers

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:19.927
are all pointing in the same direction
of the glass, pointing up.

00:05:20.642 --> 00:05:22.289
You put these two things together,

00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:25.868
the net result is that all side forces
on the glass are small

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.169
and are mainly dominated
by aerodynamic effects,

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:30.154
which at these speeds are negligible.

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:37.670
And that's why you don't need
to model the glass.

00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:40.435
It naturally doesn't spill,
no matter what the quad does.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.063
(Audience) Oh!

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.198
(Applause)

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.414
(Applause ends)

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.054
The lesson here

00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:03.091
is that some high-performance tasks
are easier than others,

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:05.452
and that understanding
the physics of the problem

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:08.170
tells you which ones are easy
and which ones are hard.

00:06:08.194 --> 00:06:10.704
In this instance, carrying
a glass of water is easy.

00:06:10.728 --> 00:06:12.358
Balancing a pole is hard.

00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:18.442
We've all heard stories of athletes
performing feats while physically injured.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:21.651
Can a machine also perform
with extreme physical damage?

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:24.121
Conventional wisdom says

00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:28.028
that you need at least four fixed motor
propeller pairs in order to fly,

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:30.576
because there are four degrees
of freedom to control:

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.565
roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:36.413
Hexacopters and octocopters,
with six and eight propellers,

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:37.896
can provide redundancy,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.885
but quadrocopters are much more popular

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.595
because they have the minimum number
of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.

00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:45.184
Or do they?

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:53.827
(Audience) Oh!

00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:55.407
(Laughter)

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.052
If we analyze the mathematical
model of this machine

00:07:04.076 --> 00:07:06.228
with only two working propellers,

00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:08.992
we discover that there's
an unconventional way to fly it.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.662
We relinquish control of yaw,

00:07:21.686 --> 00:07:24.732
but roll, pitch and acceleration
can still be controlled

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:28.102
with algorithms that exploit
this new configuration.

00:07:33.668 --> 00:07:37.957
Mathematical models tell us
exactly when and why this is possible.

00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:40.759
In this instance, this knowledge
allows us to design

00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:43.256
novel machine architectures

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.948
or to design clever algorithms
that gracefully handle damage,

00:07:46.972 --> 00:07:48.672
just like human athletes do,

00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:50.960
instead of building
machines with redundancy.

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:54.345
We can't help but hold our breath

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:57.044
when we watch a diver
somersaulting into the water,

00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:59.021
or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.552
the ground fast approaching.

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:03.120
Will the diver be able
to pull off a rip entry?

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:04.951
Will the vaulter stick the landing?

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:08.472
Suppose we want this quad here
to perform a triple flip

00:08:08.496 --> 00:08:11.322
and finish off at the exact same
spot that it started.

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:13.855
This maneuver is going
to happen so quickly

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:17.724
that we can't use position feedback
to correct the motion during execution.

00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:19.345
There simply isn't enough time.

00:08:19.782 --> 00:08:23.452
Instead, what the quad can do
is perform the maneuver blindly,

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:25.684
observe how it finishes the maneuver,

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.185
and then use that information
to modify its behavior

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:29.847
so that the next flip is better.

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:32.209
Similar to the diver and the vaulter,

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:34.128
it is only through repeated practice

00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:36.295
that the maneuver can
be learned and executed

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:37.561
to the highest standard.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.369
(Laughter)

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:50.178
(Applause)

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:54.612
Striking a moving ball
is a necessary skill in many sports.

00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:56.619
How do we make a machine do

00:08:56.643 --> 00:08:59.231
what an athlete does
seemingly without effort?

00:09:09.547 --> 00:09:11.054
(Laughter)

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:18.000
(Applause)

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.798
(Applause ends)

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:25.168
This quad has a racket
strapped onto its head

00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:28.655
with a sweet spot roughly the size
of an apple, so not too large.

00:09:29.017 --> 00:09:31.822
The following calculations
are made every 20 milliseconds,

00:09:31.846 --> 00:09:33.163
or 50 times per second.

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.877
We first figure out where
the ball is going.

00:09:36.414 --> 00:09:39.035
We then next calculate
how the quad should hit the ball

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:41.544
so that it flies
to where it was thrown from.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.382
Third, a trajectory is planned
that carries the quad

00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:49.406
from its current state
to the impact point with the ball.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.009
Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds'
worth of that strategy.

00:09:53.366 --> 00:09:56.159
Twenty milliseconds later,
the whole process is repeated

00:09:56.183 --> 00:09:57.950
until the quad strikes the ball.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.694
(Applause)

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:13.554
Machines can not only perform
dynamic maneuvers on their own,

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:15.417
they can do it collectively.

00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:19.028
These three quads are cooperatively
carrying a sky net.

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:29.268
(Applause)

00:10:32.372 --> 00:10:33.961
(Applause ends)

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:38.326
They perform an extremely dynamic
and collective maneuver

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.018
to launch the ball back to me.

00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:43.188
Notice that, at full extension,
these quads are vertical.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.234
(Applause)

00:10:50.258 --> 00:10:52.401
In fact, when fully extended,

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:55.688
this is roughly five times greater
than what a bungee jumper feels

00:10:55.712 --> 00:10:57.682
at the end of their launch.

00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:05.662
The algorithms to do this are very similar

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:08.601
to what the single quad used
to hit the ball back to me.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.910
Mathematical models are used
to continuously re-plan

00:11:11.934 --> 00:11:14.765
a cooperative strategy
50 times per second.

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:20.765
Everything we have seen so far has been
about the machines and their capabilities.

00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:23.781
What happens when we couple
this machine athleticism

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:25.288
with that of a human being?

00:11:25.765 --> 00:11:29.361
What I have in front of me
is a commercial gesture sensor

00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:30.670
mainly used in gaming.

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:32.742
It can recognize
what my various body parts

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:34.083
are doing in real time.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.789
Similar to the pointer
that I used earlier,

00:11:36.813 --> 00:11:39.035
we can use this as inputs to the system.

00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:41.826
We now have a natural way of interacting

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.111
with the raw athleticism
of these quads with my gestures.

00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:26.572
(Applause)

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:38.370
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.

00:12:38.394 --> 00:12:39.584
It can be physical.

00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:41.504
Take this quad, for example.

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:44.116
It's trying to stay
at a fixed point in space.

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:48.622
If I try to move it
out of the way, it fights me,

00:12:48.646 --> 00:12:50.520
and moves back to where it wants to be.

00:12:52.254 --> 00:12:54.341
We can change this behavior, however.

00:12:55.373 --> 00:12:57.048
We can use mathematical models

00:12:57.072 --> 00:12:59.736
to estimate the force
that I'm applying to the quad.

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:03.419
Once we know this force,
we can also change the laws of physics,

00:13:03.443 --> 00:13:05.530
as far as the quad
is concerned, of course.

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:11.251
Here, the quad is behaving
as if it were in a viscous fluid.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.289
We now have an intimate way
of interacting with a machine.

00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:21.075
I will use this new capability to position

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:23.652
this camera-carrying quad
to the appropriate location

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:26.104
for filming the remainder
of this demonstration.

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.966
So we can physically interact
with these quads

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.950
and we can change the laws of physics.

00:13:41.393 --> 00:13:43.370
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:44.908
For what you will see next,

00:13:44.932 --> 00:13:48.226
these quads will initially behave
as if they were on Pluto.

00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:51.194
As time goes on, gravity will be increased

00:13:51.218 --> 00:13:53.243
until we're all back on planet Earth,

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:55.033
but I assure you we won't get there.

00:13:55.462 --> 00:13:56.486
Okay, here goes.

00:14:04.897 --> 00:14:06.448
(Laughter)

00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:37.738
(Laughter)

00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:41.619
(Applause)

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.826
Whew!

00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:48.272
You're all thinking now,

00:14:48.296 --> 00:14:50.247
these guys are having way too much fun,

00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:52.326
and you're probably also asking yourself,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.151
why exactly are they building
machine athletes?

00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:59.096
Some conjecture that the role
of play in the animal kingdom

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.257
is to hone skills
and develop capabilities.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.905
Others think that it has
more of a social role,

00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:05.579
that it's used to bind the group.

00:15:05.603 --> 00:15:08.939
Similarly, we use the analogy
of sports and athleticism

00:15:08.963 --> 00:15:11.018
to create new algorithms for machines

00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:12.485
to push them to their limits.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.398
What impact will the speed
of machines have on our way of life?

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:19.231
Like all our past creations
and innovations,

00:15:19.255 --> 00:15:22.058
they may be used to improve
the human condition

00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:24.056
or they may be misused and abused.

00:15:24.595 --> 00:15:26.897
This is not a technical choice
we are faced with;

00:15:26.921 --> 00:15:27.936
it's a social one.

00:15:28.332 --> 00:15:29.683
Let's make the right choice,

00:15:29.707 --> 00:15:32.619
the choice that brings out the best
in the future of machines,

00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:35.508
just like athleticism in sports
can bring out the best in us.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.455
Let me introduce you to the wizards
behind the green curtain.

00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:42.813
They're the current members
of the Flying Machine Arena research team.

00:15:42.837 --> 00:15:47.054
(Applause)

00:15:47.267 --> 00:15:49.545
Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,

00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:52.994
Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin,
Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.542
Look out for them.
They're destined for great things.

00:15:55.566 --> 00:15:56.620
Thank you.

00:15:56.644 --> 00:16:00.100
(Applause)
