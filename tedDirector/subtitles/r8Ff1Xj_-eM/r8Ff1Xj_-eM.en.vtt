00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
All human life,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
all life, depends on plants.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Just think for a moment.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
or you live in a big city,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
everything comes back to plants in the end:

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
whether it's for the food, the medicine,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
that matter to us so much;

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
or whether it's soil formation,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
or the effect on the atmosphere,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
or primary production.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Damn it, even the books here are made out of plants.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
All these things, they come back to plants.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
And without them we wouldn't be here.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Now plants are under threat.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
They're under threat because of changing climate.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
with people like us.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
and their habitats.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
And whether that's because of food production,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
or because of the introduction of alien plants

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
into places that they really oughtn't be,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
or because of habitats being used for other purposes --

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
or die, or move.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
because there might be cities and other things in the way.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
So if all human life depends on plants,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
I think it does.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And the way that you save plants

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
is by storing seeds.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
are plants' futures.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
All the genetic information for future generations of plants

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
are held in seeds.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
So here is the building;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
it looks rather unassuming, really.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
But it goes down below ground many stories.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
It exists not only in southern England,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
but distributed around the world. I'll come to that.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
This is a nuclear-proof facility.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
God forbid that it should have to withstand that.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
what you're going to store in it. Right?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And we decided that what we want to store first of all,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
are the species that are most under threat.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
And those are the dry land species.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
So first of all we did deals

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
with 50 different countries.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
It means negotiating with heads of state,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160
and with secretaries of state in 50 countries

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
to sign treaties.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
We have 120 partner institutions all over the world,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
in all those countries colored orange.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
People come from all over the world to learn,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and then they go away and plan exactly how

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
they're going to collect these seeds.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
They have thousands of people all over the world

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
tagging places where those plants are said to exist.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
They search for them. They find them in flower.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And they go back when their seeds have arrived.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
And they collect the seeds. All over the world.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
some low-tech things here and there.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And the main thing is that you have to dry them

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
very carefully, at low temperature.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And then you have to store them

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
at about minus 20 degrees C --

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think --

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
with a very critically low moisture content.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And these seeds will be able to germinate,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
we believe, with many of the species,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
in thousands of years,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
and certainly in hundreds of years.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
So every 10 years we do germination tests

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
on every sample of seeds that we have.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
And this is a distributed network.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
So all around the world people are doing the same thing.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
And that enables us to develop germination protocols.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
That means that we know the right combination of heat

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
and cold and the cycles that you have to get

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
to make the seed germinate.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
And that is very useful information.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
And then we grow these things,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.160
and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
"Look, actually we're not just storing this

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
to get the seeds later,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
but we can give you this information about

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
how to germinate these difficult plants."

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And that's already happening.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
So where have we got to?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed --

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
that's three thousand millionth seed --

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160
is now stored.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
24,000 species are safe;

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Twenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
These are not just crop plants,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway --

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
fantastic work there.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
This is at least 100 times bigger.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
We have thousands of collections that have been sent out

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
all over the world:

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
especially photosynthetic-efficient plants

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
come here to the United States;

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
the list goes on and on.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
These seeds are used for restoration.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
So in habitats that have already been damaged,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
like the tall grass prairie here in the USA,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
or in mined land in various countries,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
restoration is already happening because of these species --

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
and because of this collection.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
to the left of your screen,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
they are down to the last few remaining members.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Fantastically useful plant,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
both for protein and for medicine.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
We have training going on in China, in the USA,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
and many other countries.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
How much does it cost?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
2,800 dollars per species is the average.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
I think that's cheap, at the price.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And that gets you all the scientific data

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
that goes with it.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
The future research is "How can we find

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
the genetic and molecular markers

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
for the viability of seeds,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
without having to plant them every 10 years?"

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
And we're almost there.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Thank you very much.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
(Applause)
