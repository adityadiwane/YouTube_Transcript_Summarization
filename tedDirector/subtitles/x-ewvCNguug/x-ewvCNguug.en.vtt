00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:30.499
I'd like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends

00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:31.976
in the coming century,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.976
But I want to start
with my work on romantic love,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.865
because that's my most recent work.

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:45.976
What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.976
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:51.217
17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted;

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.191
and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped.

00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:57.350
And so I want to tell you
about that first,

00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:00.239
and then go on into where
I think love is going.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:02.689
(Laughter)

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:06.459
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.456
I think our ancestors --

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.378
I think human beings have been
wondering about this question

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.178
since they sat around their campfires

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.893
or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago.

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:23.159
I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:28.666
by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.997
and as it turns out,

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:33.975
there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love.

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:36.976
The first thing that happens is,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.976
a person begins to take on
what I call, "special meaning."

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:42.195
As a truck driver once said to me,

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.000
"The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.761
George Bernard Shaw said it differently.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.253
"Love consists of overestimating
the differences

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.285
between one woman and another."

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.571
And indeed, that's what we do.

00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:58.849
(Laughter)

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:01.469
And then you just focus on this person.

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:04.310
You can list what you
don't like about them,

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:07.898
but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do.

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:09.921
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.691
In trying to understand romantic love,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.692
I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world,

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.368
and I just want to give
you one very short poem

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:20.639
from eighth-century China,

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:22.872
because it's an almost perfect example

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:26.260
of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman.

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:29.864
It's a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:31.526
and you walk into a parking lot --

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.930
their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.460
Their wine glass at dinner

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:39.976
is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.764
And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat.

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:45.511
And it goes like this.

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:47.026
It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:50.976
"I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.642
The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."

00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:57.825
He became hooked on a sleeping mat,

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.825
probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.270
just like with you and me.

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:05.459
But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning,

00:03:05.483 --> 00:03:07.929
you focus your attention on them.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.554
You aggrandize them.

00:03:09.578 --> 00:03:11.339
But you have intense energy.

00:03:11.363 --> 00:03:14.858
As one Polynesian said,
"I felt like jumping in the sky."

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:18.603
You're up all night.
You're walking till dawn.

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:21.586
You feel intense elation
when things are going well;

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.159
mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly.

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.637
Real dependence on this person.

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.060
As one businessman in New York said to me,

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.945
"Anything she liked, I liked."

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.485
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:37.976
You become extremely sexually possessive.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.731
You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually,

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:43.625
you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else.

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.203
But the moment you fall in love,

00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:47.523
you become extremely
sexually possessive of them.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:50.976
I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.633
The whole point of this
is to pull two people together

00:03:53.657 --> 00:03:56.963
strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving:

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.422
an intense craving
to be with a particular person,

00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:06.669
not just sexually, but emotionally.

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:10.421
It would be nice to go to bed with them,

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:14.677
but you want them to call you
on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.557
to tell you that they love you.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.182
The other main characteristic
is motivation.

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:25.571
The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.864
And last but not least,
it is an obsession.

00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:32.976
Before I put these people
in the MRI machine,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.976
I would ask them all kinds of questions.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.165
But my most important question
was always the same.

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.976
It was: "What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.890
And indeed, they would say,

00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:47.071
"All day. All night.

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:49.436
I can never stop thinking
about him or her."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.810
And then, the very last question --

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.433
I would always have to work
myself up to this question,

00:04:54.457 --> 00:04:56.024
because I'm not a psychologist.

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:59.024
I don't work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation.

00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:01.299
My final question was always the same.

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:03.976
I would say,
"Would you die for him or her?"

00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:06.536
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.671
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:11.389
I was just staggered by it.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:15.220
So we scanned their brains,

00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:17.354
looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:19.146
and looking at a neutral photograph,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.004
with a distraction task in between.

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:25.976
So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.297
and when it was in a resting state.

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.140
And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.822
In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region

00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:37.054
that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:05:37.657 --> 00:05:40.000
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.269
I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion.

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:48.149
In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions,

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:49.879
from very high to very low.

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:51.609
But actually, it's a drive.

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.768
It comes from the motor of the mind,

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:57.457
the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind.

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.976
The kind of part of the mind

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.640
when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate,

00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:05.502
when you want to win
that promotion at work.

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:07.445
The motor of the brain.

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:08.673
It's a drive.

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:11.800
And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive.

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.649
You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you,

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:16.110
and they say, "No, thank you,"

00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.651
you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression.

00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:22.868
But certainly, around the world,

00:06:22.892 --> 00:06:26.849
people who are rejected
in love will kill for it.

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.484
People live for love.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:29.768
They kill for love.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:30.823
They die for love.

00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:34.855
They have songs, poems, novels,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.823
sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.

00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:40.996
In over 175 societies,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.804
people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system.

00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:46.851
I have come to think

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:49.463
it's one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth

00:06:49.487 --> 00:06:52.064
for both great joy and great sorrow.

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.096
And I've also come to think

00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:57.603
that it's one of three
basically different brain systems

00:06:57.628 --> 00:06:59.675
that evolved from mating and reproduction.

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:03.127
One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification.

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:06.976
W.H. Auden called it
an "intolerable neural itch,"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.975
and indeed, that's what it is.

00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:12.722
It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry.

00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:16.850
The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love:

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:18.976
that elation, obsession of early love.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.356
And the third brain system is attachment:

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.333
that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner.

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:28.510
And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there,

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:31.089
looking for a whole range of partners.

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:33.898
You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car.

00:07:33.922 --> 00:07:35.294
It can be focused on nobody.

00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:38.976
I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.976
on just one individual at a time,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.832
thereby conserving mating time and energy.

00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:46.586
And I think that attachment,
the third brain system,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.152
evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:54.229
at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.498
So with that preamble,

00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:03.553
I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.283
One of the last 10,000 years

00:08:06.307 --> 00:08:11.004
and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years,

00:08:11.028 --> 00:08:15.280
that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems:

00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:18.857
lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner.

00:08:19.262 --> 00:08:23.723
The first is women working,
moving into the workforce.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:29.224
I've looked at 130 societies

00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:31.889
through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations.

00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:36.645
Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.976
women are not only moving
into the job market --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.976
sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.854
and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:50.675
in terms of economic power,
health and education.

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:51.835
It's very slow.

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:54.976
For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.313
We all know of them, but nevertheless --

00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:03.733
the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark,
but the caravan moves on."

00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:06.084
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:08.795
Women are moving back into the job market.

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:11.976
And I say back into the job market,
because this is not new.

00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:15.989
For millions of years,
on the grasslands of Africa,

00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:19.163
women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables.

00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:22.847
They came home with 60 to 80 percent
of the evening meal.

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:25.759
The double income family was the standard.

00:09:25.783 --> 00:09:29.213
And women were regarded
as just as economically,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:32.976
socially and sexually powerful as men.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.803
In short, we're really
moving forward to the past.

00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:42.516
Then, women's worst
invention was the plow.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.214
With the beginning of plow agriculture,
men's roles became extremely powerful.

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:50.674
Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors,

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:54.377
but then with the industrial revolution
and the post-industrial revolution

00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:56.344
they're moving back into the job market.

00:09:56.368 --> 00:10:01.495
In short, they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago,

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:04.743
10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:09.338
We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions

00:10:09.362 --> 00:10:11.695
in the history of the human animal.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:15.262
And it's going to have an impact.

00:10:15.286 --> 00:10:16.819
I generally give a whole lecture

00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:19.147
on the impact of women
on the business community.

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.228
I'll say just a couple of things,
and then go on to sex and love.

00:10:22.252 --> 00:10:24.109
There's a lot of gender differences;

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.309
anybody who thinks men and women are alike

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:28.275
simply never had a boy and a girl child.

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.492
I don't know why they want to think
that men and women are alike.

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.039
There's much we have in common,

00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:35.976
but there's a whole lot
that we do not have in common.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.976
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.104
"I think that we are like two feet.
We need each other to get ahead."

00:10:43.128 --> 00:10:45.976
But we did not evolve
to have the same brain.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.449
And we're finding more and more
gender differences in the brain.

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:52.600
I'll only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love.

00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.731
One of them is women's verbal ability.

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:55.976
Women can talk.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.976
Women's ability to find the right word
rapidly, basic articulation

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.378
goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle,

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:03.973
when estrogen levels peak.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.615
But even at menstruation,
they're better than the average man.

00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:09.147
Women can talk.

00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:12.976
They've been doing it for a million years;
words were women's tools.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.087
They held that baby
in front of their face,

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.920
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.976
And, indeed, they're becoming
a very powerful force.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.237
Even in places like India and Japan,

00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.658
where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market,

00:11:30.682 --> 00:11:32.515
they're moving into journalism.

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:36.976
And I think that the television
is like the global campfire.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.976
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.084
Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me,

00:11:45.108 --> 00:11:47.251
who negotiates what we're going to say,

00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:48.330
is a woman.

00:11:48.354 --> 00:11:51.012
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,

00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:54.190
"To have a great writer
is to have another government."

00:11:54.682 --> 00:11:59.269
Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women.

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:02.831
It's one of many, many
characteristics that women have

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:05.135
that they will bring into the job market.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.286
They've got incredible people skills,
negotiating skills.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.976
They're highly imaginative.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.579
We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination, of long-term planning.

00:12:15.603 --> 00:12:17.723
They tend to be web thinkers.

00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:20.532
Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected,

00:12:20.556 --> 00:12:23.730
they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think,

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:28.457
put them into more complex patterns,
see more options and outcomes.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.187
They tend to be contextual,
holistic thinkers,

00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:33.751
what I call web thinkers.

00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:35.780
Men tend to -- and these are averages --

00:12:35.804 --> 00:12:38.463
tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous,

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:39.872
focus on what they do,

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:45.822
and move in a more
step-by-step thinking pattern.

00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:48.273
They're both perfectly good
ways of thinking.

00:12:48.297 --> 00:12:50.529
We need both of them to get ahead.

00:12:50.553 --> 00:12:53.976
In fact, there's many more
male geniuses in the world.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.721
And there's also many more
male idiots in the world.

00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:58.471
(Laughter)

00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:01.677
When the male brain works well,
it works extremely well.

00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:05.035
And what I really think
that we're doing is,

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:07.345
we're moving towards
a collaborative society,

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.171
a society in which the talents
of both men and women

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:13.976
are becoming understood
and valued and employed.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.763
But in fact, women moving
into the job market

00:13:16.787 --> 00:13:21.897
is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life.

00:13:22.608 --> 00:13:27.692
Foremost, women are starting
to express their sexuality.

00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:30.342
I'm always astonished
when people come to me and say,

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:32.684
"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:35.421
"Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women?"

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:37.016
"Well, men are more adulterous!"

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.978
And I say, "Who do you think
these men are sleeping with?"

00:13:40.002 --> 00:13:41.406
(Laughter)

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.158
And -- basic math!

00:13:43.182 --> 00:13:44.356
Anyway.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.976
In the Western world,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.976
women start sooner at sex,
have more partners,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.885
express less remorse
for the partners that they do,

00:13:53.909 --> 00:13:56.591
marry later, have fewer children,

00:13:56.615 --> 00:13:59.520
leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones.

00:13:59.544 --> 00:14:03.523
We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression.

00:14:03.547 --> 00:14:08.268
And, indeed, once again we're moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:11.976
that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.976
because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.258
in hunting and gathering societies today.

00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:21.841
We're also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.976
They're now saying that the 21st century

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.976
is going to be the century of what
they call the "symmetrical marriage,"

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.384
or the "pure marriage,"
or the "companionate marriage."

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:39.976
This is a marriage between equals,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.443
moving forward to a pattern

00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:45.601
that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit.

00:14:46.775 --> 00:14:49.314
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.

00:14:49.786 --> 00:14:54.012
91 percent of American women
and 86 percent of American men

00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:58.639
would not marry somebody
who had every single quality

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.479
they were looking for in a partner,

00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:03.266
if they were not in love with that person.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.809
People around the world,
in a study of 37 societies,

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:10.470
want to be in love
with the person that they marry.

00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:17.000
Indeed, arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life.

00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:23.412
I even think that marriages
might even become more stable

00:15:23.436 --> 00:15:27.190
because of the second great world trend.

00:15:27.214 --> 00:15:29.976
The first one being women
moving into the job market,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.850
the second one being
the aging world population.

00:15:32.874 --> 00:15:35.301
They're now saying that in America,

00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:38.976
that middle age should be regarded
as up to age 85.

00:15:39.642 --> 00:15:44.521
Because in that highest
age category of 76 to 85,

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:47.976
as much as 40 percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.382
So we're seeing there's a real
extension of middle age.

00:15:51.714 --> 00:15:56.976
For one of my books,
I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.231
And as it turns out, the older you get,
the less likely you are to divorce.

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:05.197
So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America,

00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:07.555
and it's actually beginning to decline.

00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:09.181
It may decline some more.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:16.132
I would even say that with Viagra,

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:19.971
estrogen replacement, hip replacements

00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:21.976
and the incredibly interesting women

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.105
-- women have never been
as interesting as they are now.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:28.587
Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated,

00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.558
so interesting, so capable.

00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:36.341
And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution

00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:40.230
when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages, that time is now.

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:44.717
However, there's always kinds
of complications in this.

00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:49.458
These three brain systems --
lust, romantic love and attachment --

00:16:49.482 --> 00:16:50.836
don't always go together.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.559
They can go together, by the way.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.535
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:56.828
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.

00:16:56.852 --> 00:16:58.948
Dopamine's associated with romantic love,

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:00.995
and you can just
fall in love with somebody

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.882
who you're just having casual sex with.

00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:06.342
With orgasm, then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin --

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:08.397
those are associated with attachment.

00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:12.380
This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody

00:17:12.404 --> 00:17:14.253
after you've made love to them.

00:17:14.277 --> 00:17:18.976
But these three brain systems:
lust, romantic love and attachment,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.481
aren't always connected to each other.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.251
You can feel deep attachment
to a long-term partner

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:29.367
while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else,

00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:34.844
while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners.

00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:40.341
In short, we're capable of loving
more than one person at a time.

00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:42.706
In fact, you can lie in bed at night

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.976
and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.432
to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else.

00:17:49.456 --> 00:17:52.337
It's as if there's a committee meeting
going on in your head

00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:55.488
as you are trying to decide what to do.

00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:57.147
So I don't think, honestly,

00:17:57.171 --> 00:17:59.186
we're an animal
that was built to be happy;

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.478
we are an animal
that was built to reproduce.

00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:04.437
I think the happiness we find, we make.

00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:07.943
And I think, however,

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:10.634
we can make good relationships
with each other.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.105
So I want to conclude with two things.

00:18:13.129 --> 00:18:15.176
I want to conclude with a worry,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.129
and with a wonderful story.

00:18:19.287 --> 00:18:21.976
The worry is about antidepressants.

00:18:23.631 --> 00:18:28.763
Over 100 million prescriptions
of antidepressants

00:18:28.787 --> 00:18:31.608
are written every year
in the United States.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.665
And these drugs are going generic.

00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:37.172
They are seeping around the world.

00:18:37.743 --> 00:18:42.976
I know one girl who's been
on these antidepressants,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.976
SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
antidepressants -- since she was 13.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.976
She's 23. She's been on them
ever since she was 13.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.516
I've got nothing against people
who take them short term,

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.763
when they're going
through something horrible.

00:18:55.787 --> 00:18:58.142
They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else.

00:18:58.166 --> 00:18:59.234
I would recommend it.

00:18:59.258 --> 00:19:01.717
But more and more people
in the United States

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.125
are taking them long term.

00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:09.514
And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin.

00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:14.795
And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit.

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:16.381
Everybody knows that.

00:19:16.944 --> 00:19:19.839
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.777
Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit,

00:19:24.801 --> 00:19:26.668
but they kill the sex drive.

00:19:27.316 --> 00:19:31.140
And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm.

00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:32.355
And when you kill orgasm,

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:36.246
you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment.

00:19:36.712 --> 00:19:38.976
The things are connected in the brain.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.656
And when you tamper with one brain system,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.625
you're going to tamper with another.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.754
I'm just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place.

00:19:49.738 --> 00:19:50.740
So now --

00:19:50.764 --> 00:19:54.976
(Applause)

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.703
Thank you.

00:19:56.727 --> 00:19:58.212
I want to end with a story.

00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:00.139
And then, just a comment.

00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:06.520
I've been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years.

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:12.290
I'm an identical twin;
I am interested in why we're all alike.

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.976
Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River

00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:20.024
are all alike.

00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:23.086
And about a year ago,

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.095
an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:29.771
and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them.

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:32.597
I said, "I don't know anything
about personality. You know?

00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:35.341
I don't know. Do you think
you've got the right person?"

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:36.405
They said, "Yes."

00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:39.452
It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:41.208
with one person rather than another.

00:20:41.232 --> 00:20:44.675
That's my current project;
it will be my next book.

00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:46.801
There's all kinds of reasons

00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:49.578
that you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

00:20:49.602 --> 00:20:52.888
Timing is important.
Proximity is important.

00:20:52.912 --> 00:20:54.292
Mystery is important.

00:20:54.316 --> 00:20:57.045
You fall in love with somebody
who's somewhat mysterious,

00:20:57.069 --> 00:20:59.747
in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain,

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.537
probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love.

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:03.990
You fall in love with somebody

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:06.109
who fits within
what I call your "love map,"

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:08.280
an unconscious list of traits

00:21:08.304 --> 00:21:10.618
that you build in childhood
as you grow up.

00:21:10.642 --> 00:21:13.684
And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people,

00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:16.976
actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.287
And that's what I'm now
contributing to this.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:22.976
But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.976
I've been carrying on here
about the biology of love.

00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:30.396
I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too,

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.587
the magic of it.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.349
It's a story that was told to me

00:21:36.373 --> 00:21:38.834
by somebody who had
heard it just from one --

00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:39.976
probably a true story.

00:21:41.508 --> 00:21:44.976
It was a graduate student --
I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.976
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.371
That's where we put our people
in the MRI machine.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.563
And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student,

00:21:54.587 --> 00:21:56.960
and she was not in love with him.

00:21:58.206 --> 00:22:00.461
And they were
all at a conference in Beijing.

00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:04.519
And he knew from our work

00:22:04.543 --> 00:22:08.951
that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody,

00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:10.976
you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.693
and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love.

00:22:14.717 --> 00:22:16.874
(Laughter)

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.784
So he decided he'd put science to work.

00:22:21.624 --> 00:22:24.958
And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him.

00:22:25.809 --> 00:22:27.878
And sure enough -- I've never been in one,

00:22:27.902 --> 00:22:30.640
but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks

00:22:30.664 --> 00:22:33.482
and it's crazy and it's noisy
and it's exciting.

00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:35.792
He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine,

00:22:35.816 --> 00:22:37.348
and she'd fall in love with him.

00:22:37.372 --> 00:22:42.346
So off they go and she's squealing
and squeezing him

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.887
and laughing and having a wonderful time.

00:22:44.911 --> 00:22:48.450
An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw,

00:22:48.474 --> 00:22:52.054
and she throws her hands up and she says,

00:22:52.078 --> 00:22:54.390
"Wasn't that wonderful?"

00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:57.828
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw
driver handsome!"

00:22:57.852 --> 00:23:00.921
(Laughter)

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:06.976
(Applause)

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.162
There's magic to love!

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.797
(Applause)

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.441
But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago,

00:23:13.465 --> 00:23:15.797
we evolved three basic drives:

00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:18.340
the sex drive, romantic love

00:23:18.364 --> 00:23:20.704
and attachment to a long-term partner.

00:23:20.728 --> 00:23:23.807
These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain.

00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:28.606
They're going to survive
as long as our species survives

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.338
on what Shakespeare called
"this mortal coil."

00:23:31.362 --> 00:23:32.368
Thank you.

00:23:32.392 --> 00:23:33.817
Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!

00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:34.904
(Applause)
