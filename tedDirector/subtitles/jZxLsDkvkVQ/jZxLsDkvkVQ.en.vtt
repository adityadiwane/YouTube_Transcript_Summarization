00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
How are we going to introduce her?"

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And I said, "I think she's dancing."

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And I could see everybody looked at me,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
somebody said, "Bollywood."

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And the third said, "Let's find another director."

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I thought I had better change.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
What are you talking about?"

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
So I rethought the whole thing,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and then we all came to a consensus.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And here was the introduction of this

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
great British icon called "Elizabeth."

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Leicester: May I join you, my lady?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
(Music)

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
So how many people who saw the film did not get

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that here was a woman in love,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
that she was completely innocent

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And how many of you did not get that?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
That's the power of visual storytelling,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
the power of not knowing.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
When I go out to direct a film,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
every day we prepare too much, we think too much.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
You know, simple words lost

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
in the quicksand of experience.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So I come up, and I say,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and I put myself into absolute panic.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
getting rid of this mind that says,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
You're a director, you've done it for years."

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So I've got to get there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
and be in complete panic.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I go and I panic myself, I get scared.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And the studio executives, they would say,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
because he's chaotic.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
I'm allowing myself to go into chaos

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
because out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
All preparation is preparation.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I don't even know if it's honest.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
I don't even know if it's truthful.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
and if you get five great moments

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
of great, organic stuff

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
in your storytelling, in your film,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
your film, audiences will get it.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
and saying, "I don't know what to say."

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
200 people at seven in the morning

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and everybody's saying,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And you put yourself into a state of panic

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
where you don't know, and so you don't know.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And so, because you don't know,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the way Einstein -- say a prayer --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
accessed his equations,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
the same source. I'm looking for the same source

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
because creativity comes from absolutely the same source

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that you meditate somewhere outside yourself,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
outside the universe.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
You're looking for something that comes and hits you.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So what do you do?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
why don't you show me what you want to do?"

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Laughter)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and I follow all the time is: Panic.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Panic is the great access of creativity

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
because that's the only way to get rid of your mind.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Get rid of your mind.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Get out of it, get it out.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And let's go to the universe because

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
there's something out there that is more

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
truthful than your mind,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
that is more truthful than your universe.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
because that's what I follow constantly

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So that's what I do.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
When I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
You remember how India was. There was no pollution.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.260
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and we used to sleep out at night.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
At school I was being just taught about physics,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and I was told that

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
if there is something that exists,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
then it is measurable.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
If it is not measurable,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
it does not exist.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and I used to stare at the universe and say,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
"How far does this universe go?"

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
My father was a doctor.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So I said, "Please measure forever

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
because in school they're teaching me

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It doesn't come into my frame of reference."

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
So, how far does eternity go?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
What does forever mean?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And I would lie there crying at night

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
because my imagination could not touch creativity.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
So what did I do?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
At that time, at the tender age of seven,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
I created a story.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
What was my story?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
There was a woodcutter

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.260
and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And when that ax hits that piece of wood,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
that's when everything will destroy

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and the Big Bang will happen again.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But all before that there was a woodcutter.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And then when I would run out of that story,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
I would imagine that woodcutter's universe

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
So every time, I could tell my story again and again

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and get over this problem,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and so I got over the problem.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
How did I do it? Tell a story.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
So what is a story?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
A story is our -- all of us --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
we are the stories we tell ourselves.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.260
In this universe, and this existence,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
where we live with this duality

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
of whether we exist or not

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and who are we,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
the stories we tell ourselves are the stories

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
that define the potentialities

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
of our existence.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
We are the stories we tell ourselves.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So that's as wide as we look at stories.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
A story is the relationship

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.260
that you develop between who you are,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
or who you potentially are,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
We tell our stories,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and a person without a story does not exist.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
So Einstein told a story

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and followed his stories and came up with theories

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and he went out to conquer the world.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
We tell ourselves stories.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
So, I will go further, and I say,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
I exist because there are stories,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and if there are no stories, we don't exist.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
We create stories to define our existence.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
If we do not create the stories,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
we probably go mad.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Now, a film.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
A film tells a story.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
that are given to a director --

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
would we get Buddhism better?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
But that puts some kind of burden on me.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
I have to tell a story

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
in a much more elaborate way,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
but I have the potential.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
It's called subtext.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
When I first went to Hollywood, they said --

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
if you talk about subtext.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Just talk about plot

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
what the visuals will be."

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
So when I look at a film,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
here's what we look for:

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
We look for a story on the plot level,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
then we look for a story

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
on the psychological level,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
then we look for a story on the political level,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
then we look at a story

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
on a mythological level.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And I look for stories on each level.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
Now, it is not necessary

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
that these stories agree with each other.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
What is wonderful is,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.260
at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Find that which is not.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Find the truth for yourself,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and when you find the truth for yourself,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
but don't worry about it."

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
the writer was telling:

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
A woman who was threatened

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
by Philip II

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and was going to war,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and then Walter Raleigh

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
fell in love with her lady in waiting,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
or she wanted...

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Here's the story I was telling:

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
The gods up there,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
there were two people.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
There was Philip II, who was divine

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
because he was always praying,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
But the divine one was unjust,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
so the gods said,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
"OK, what we need to do is

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
help the just one."

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
And so they helped the just one.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
to physically separate her mortal self

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
from her spirit self.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
And the mortal self was the girl

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that Walter Raleigh was sent,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and gradually he separated her

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
so she was free to be divine.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
And the two divine people fought,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
and the gods were on the side of divinity.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
Of course, all the British press got really upset.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
They said, "We won the Armada."

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
But I said, "But the storm won the Armada.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
The gods sent the storm."

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
So what was I doing?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
I was trying to find a mythic reason

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
to make the film.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
She said, "The film's about a woman

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
coming to terms with growing older."

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Psychological.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
The writer said "It's about history, plot."

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
I said "It's about mythology,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
the gods."

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
So let me show you a film --

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
a piece from that film --

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and how a camera also --

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
so this is a scene, where in my mind,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
she was at the depths of mortality.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
She was discovering what mortality actually means,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
and if she is at the depths of mortality,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
what really happens.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
and why she should break away from mortality.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Remember, in the film, to me,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
both her and her lady in waiting

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
were parts of the same body,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
one the mortal self

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and one the spirit self.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
So can we have that second?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
(Music)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
Elizabeth: Bess?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Bess?

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
Bess Throckmorton?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Bess: Here, my lady.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Are you with child?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Are you with child?

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Bess: Yes, my lady.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Elizabeth: Traitorous.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
You dare to keep secrets from me?

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
You ask my permission before you rut,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
before you breed.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
My bitches wear my collars.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Is it his?

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
Bess: Yes.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
My lady,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
it is my husband's child.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Raleigh: Majesty.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
This is not the queen I love and serve.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
and she has married without royal consent.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Go.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
You no longer have the queen's protection.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
Bess: As you wish, Majesty.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
Get out.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
(Music)

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
Elizabeth has realized,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
and she's coming face-to-face

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
with her own sense of jealousy,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
her own sense of mortality.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.260
What am I doing with the architecture?

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
The architecture is telling a story.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
The architecture is telling a story

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
about how, even though she's the most powerful woman

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
in the world at that time,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
there is the other, the architecture's bigger.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
It'll survive her.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
She's in the absolute well

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
of her own sense of being mortal.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
That's where she has to pull herself out

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
from the depths of mortality,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
come in, release her spirit.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
And that's the moment where, in my mind,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
But that's the moment

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
she's surgically removing herself from that.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
So the film is operating on

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
many many levels in that scene.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And how we tell stories

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
visually, with music, with actors,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
and at each level it's a different sense

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
and sometimes contradictory to each other.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.260
So how do I start all this?

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
What's the process of telling a story?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
About ten years ago,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
I heard this little thing from a politician,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
not a politician that was very well respected in India.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And he said that these people in the cities,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.260
in one flush, expend as much water

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
as you people in the rural areas

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
don't get for your family for two days.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
I went to see a friend of mine,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
and he made me wait

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
in his apartment in Malabar Hill

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
on the twentieth floor,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
I got bored and left, and as I drove out,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
I drove past the slums of Bombay,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
as you always do,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
of women and children with buckets

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
waiting for a tanker

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
to come and give them water.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
And an idea started to develop.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
So how does that become a story?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
So my next film is called "Paani"

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
which means water.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
And now, out of the mythology of that,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
I'm starting to create a world.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.260
What kind of world do I create,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
and where does the idea, the design of that come?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
So, in my mind, in the future,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
they started to build flyovers.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
You understand flyovers? Yeah?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
They started to build flyovers

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
to get from A to B faster,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.260
but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
to another area of relative wealth.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
And then what they did was

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
they created a city above the flyovers.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
And the rich people moved to the upper city

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and left the poorer people in the lower cities,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
about 10 to 12 percent of the people

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.260
have moved to the upper city.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
There's a mythology in India about --

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.260
where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.260
[Hindi]

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Right. What does that mean?

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
and survive on the shoulders of the poor.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.260
So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
So the design has a story.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
they suck up all the water.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.260
Remember the word I said, suck up.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.260
They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.260
and they drip feed the lower city.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
And, because democracy still exists,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
there's a democratic way in which you say

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.260
"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
So, okay my time is up.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.260
But I can go on about telling you

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
how we evolve stories,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260
and how stories effectively are who we are

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.260
and how these get translated into the particular discipline

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
that I am in, which is film.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
Everything's a contradiction.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
The universe is a contradiction.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260
But you get up at 4 a.m.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.260
That first blush of blue is where the night and day

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260
are trying to find harmony with each other.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.260
Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.260
All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
It's the effect of looking for harmony

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.260
in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.260
a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260
In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.260
in the universe's mind, between day and night.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.260
In the mind of a man and a woman,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
we're looking constantly at

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
the contradiction between male and female,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.260
we're looking for harmony within each other.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.260
The whole idea of contradiction,

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
but the acceptance of contradiction

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
is the telling of a story, not the resolution.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.260
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.260
that we try to resolve the contradiction.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
Harmony is not resolution.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
that is much larger than resolution.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
Harmony is the suggestion of something

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.260
that is embracing and universal

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.260
and of eternity and of the moment.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.260
Resolution is something that is far more limited.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.260
It is finite; harmony is infinite.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.260
So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.260
is looking for harmony and infinity

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.260
in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.260
letting another go and creating a question that is really important.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.260
Thank you very much.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.260
(Applause)
