00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
introduced a design challenge

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
called the marshmallow challenge.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And the idea's pretty simple:

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
one yard of tape, one yard of string

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
and a marshmallow.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The marshmallow has to be on top.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
because it forces people

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
to collaborate very quickly.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and I incorporated it into a design workshop.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And it was a huge success.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And since then, I've conducted

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
about 70 design workshops across the world

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
with students and designers and architects,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and there's something about this exercise

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
that reveals very deep lessons

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
about the nature of collaboration,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and I'd like to share some of them with you.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So, normally, most people begin

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
by orienting themselves to the task.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
they jockey for power.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Then they spend some time planning, organizing,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
They spend the majority of their time

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And then finally, just as they're running out of time,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
someone takes out the marshmallow,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and then they gingerly put it on top,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
they admire their work.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
But what really happens, most of the time,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
to buckle and to collapse.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So there are a number of people

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
(Laughter)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
They lie, they cheat, they get distracted

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and they produce really lame structures.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And of course there are teams

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
(Laughter)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
And it's pretty amazing.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
As Peter tells us,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
not only do they produce the tallest structures,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
but they're the most interesting structures of them all.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So the question you want to ask is:

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
How come? Why? What is it about them?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And Peter likes to say that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
none of the kids spend any time

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
They don't spend time jockeying for power.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
But there's another reason as well.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And the reason is that business students are trained

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to find the single right plan, right?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And then they execute on it.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
they run out of time and what happens?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
It's a crisis.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Sound familiar? Right.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
What kindergarteners do differently

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
is that they start with the marshmallow,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
always keeping the marshmallow on top,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Designers recognize this type of collaboration

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
as the essence of the iterative process.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And with each version, kids get instant feedback

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
about what works and what doesn't work.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
but let's look at how different teams perform.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So the average for most people is around 20 inches;

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
business schools students, about half of that;

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
kindergarteners, better than most adults.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Who does the very best?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Architects and engineers, thankfully.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.260
(Laughter)

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And why is it? Because they understand triangles

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
are the key to building

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
stable structures.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
So CEOs, a little bit better than average,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
but here's where it gets interesting.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
they get significantly better.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
(Laughter)

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Because they have special skills

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
of facilitation.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
They manage the process, they understand the process.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And any team who manages

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and pays close attention to work

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
will significantly improve the team's performance.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Specialized skills and facilitation skills

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
are the combination that leads to strong success.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
If you have 10 teams that typically perform,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And I tried something interesting.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I thought, let's up the ante, once.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So what do you think happened to these design students?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
What was the result?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Here's what happened:

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Not one team had a standing structure.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
they would have taken home the prize.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
have a strong impact.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
We did the exercise again with the same students.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
What do you think happened then?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So now they understand the value of prototyping.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So the same team went from being the very worst

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
to being among the very best.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
So there's deep lessons for us

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
about the nature of incentives and success.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So, you might ask: Why would anyone

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And the reason is, I help create

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
digital tools and processes

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
to help teams build cars and video games

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and visual effects.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And what the marshmallow challenge does

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Because, frankly,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
The challenge provides a shared experience,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
a common language,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
a common stance to build the right prototype.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
And so, this is the value of the experience,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
of this so simple exercise.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And those of you who are interested

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
It's a blog that you can look at

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
how to build the marshmallows.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
There's step-by-step instructions on this.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
There are crazy examples from around the world

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
of how people tweak and adjust the system.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
There's world records that are on this as well.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
And the fundamental lesson, I believe,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
is that design truly is

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
a contact sport.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
and that we apply the very best of our thinking,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
our feeling and our doing

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
to the challenge that we have at hand.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
is all that it takes to turn us

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And that can make a big difference.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Thank you very much.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
(Applause)
