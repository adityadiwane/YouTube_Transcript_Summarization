00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:29.405
As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.700
standing in front of an audience is a cross between

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.700
so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
by relying on words on paper,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.700
and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700
I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
to become a documentary photographer.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.700
and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
The war in Vietnam was raging;

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.700
the Civil Rights Movement was under way;

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
and photographers were telling us another.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.700
I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700
They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.700
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.700
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.700
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700
specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.700
both the benefits and the cost of political policies.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700
It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.700
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.700
it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
and asking us to reassess our behavior.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700
It puts a human face on issues

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
which from afar can appear abstract

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.700
or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.700
And I understood that documentary photography

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.700
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.700
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.700
And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700
and gives impetus to public debate,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
thereby preventing the interested parties

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.700
from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
Coming of age in those days made real

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700
the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.700
for a free and dynamic society to function properly.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.700
The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.700
it must be a successful business,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
but the right balance must be found

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.700
between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.700
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.700
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.700
and the service it provides is awareness.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.700
Every story does not have to sell something.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700
There's also a time to give.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700
That was a tradition I wanted to follow.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.700
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.700
and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution --

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.700
I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700
But I was driven by an inherent sense

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
that a picture that revealed the true face of war

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.700
would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.700
I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700
and issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700
In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.700
10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700
in protest against conditions in jail.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.700
The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.700
I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.700
are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.700
During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.700
which was engulfed by civil wars

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700
that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.700
In Guatemala, the central government --

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.700
controlled by a oligarchy of European decent --

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.700
was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700
and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.700
conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.700
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.700
as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.700
A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.700
was left as a monument in a park in Managua,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.700
and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.700
At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.700
and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.700
I've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.700
This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700
when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.700
In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.700
and one of the major incidents was

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.700
the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.700
in the West Bank town of Jenin.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.700
Without the political will to find common ground,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.700
the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.700
only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700
and perpetuates the cycle of violence.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.700
In the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700
Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.700
between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.700
This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.700
neighbor against neighbor.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.700
A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.700
where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.700
A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700
and was used as a makeshift morgue.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.700
Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.700
and used as barter for the return of prisoners

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.700
or Bosnian soldiers killed in action.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700
This was once a park.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.700
The Bosnian soldier who guided me

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.700
told me that all of his friends were there now.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.700
At the same time in South Africa,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.700
after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.700
the black population commenced the final phase

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.700
of liberation from apartheid.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.700
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.700
was what to do with my anger.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.700
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.700
that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.700
In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.700
Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.700
After several weeks, they washed off the white

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.700
and took on the full responsibilities of men.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.300
It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:52.700
of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.700
Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.700
Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.700
In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700
Farmers were driven off their land,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.700
and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.700
Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction --

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.700
primitive but extremely effective.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.700
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.700
slowly and painfully.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.700
The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.700
and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.700
American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.700
but they were eventually drawn into the conflict,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.700
and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.700
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.700
as a means of genocide.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.700
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.700
staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:09.700
I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.700
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.700
and to do as much justice as possible

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
to the experience of the people I'm photographing.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.700
This man was in an NGO feeding center,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
being helped as much as he could be helped.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.700
yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.700
He had not given up, and if he didn't give up,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.700
how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.700
In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.700
I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.700
and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.700
It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.700
The next day I left for Rwanda,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.700
and it was like taking the express elevator to hell.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.700
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.700
He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.700
and he even turned his face toward the light,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.700
as if he wanted me to see him better.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.700
I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.700
This time, maybe confused or discouraged

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.700
by the military disaster in Somalia,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.700
the international community remained silent,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.700
and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.700
by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors --

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.700
using farm implements as weapons.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.346
Perhaps because a lesson had been learned

00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:45.700
by the weak response to the war in Bosnia

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.700
and the failure in Rwanda,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.700
when Serbia attacked Kosovo,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.392
international action was taken much more decisively.

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:57.700
NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.423
Ethnic Albanians had been murdered,

00:11:00.423 --> 00:11:04.700
their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.700
They were received in refugee camps

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.700
set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.

00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:16.700
The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:20.254
The image reminded me of a cave painting,

00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:24.700
and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.

00:11:26.177 --> 00:11:30.223
Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:32.700
in Chechnya from inside Grozny.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.700
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.346
The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,

00:11:42.346 --> 00:11:45.700
killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.177
I found a boy from the local orphanage

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:51.700
wandering around the front line.

00:11:53.008 --> 00:11:56.700
My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.392
to a focus on critical social issues as well.

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:03.700
After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.700
and discovered a kind of gulag of children,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.700
where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.700
Ceausescu had imposed a quota

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.700
on the number of children to be produced by each family,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.700
thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.700
Children who couldn't be supported by their families

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.700
were raised in government orphanages.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.700
Children with birth defects were labeled incurables,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.700
and confined for life to inhuman conditions.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.700
As reports began to surface, again international aid went in.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.700
Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.700
I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.700
where there had been no regard for the environment

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.700
or the health of either workers or the general population.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.700
An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.700
was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.700
and four out of five workers came down with cancer.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.362
After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,

00:13:09.362 --> 00:13:12.131
I began to explore conditions of poverty

00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.362
in a country that was on its way towards modernization.

00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:18.700
I spent a good deal of time with a man

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.700
who lived with his family on a railway embankment

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.700
and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700
When the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.700
A trust fund was established,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.700
and the family now lives in a house in the countryside

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.700
and all their basic necessities are taken care of.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.700
It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.700
Journalism had provided a channel

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.700
for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.700
I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.700
and ended up living in a train station.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.700
By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.700
The rural poor had become the urban poor,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.700
and in the process, they'd become invisible.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.300
These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.192
reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:

00:14:14.192 --> 00:14:17.700
isolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.885
Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:28.823
to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.

00:14:28.823 --> 00:14:33.700
The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.700
that was sprayed in vast quantities,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.700
and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.362
In 2000, I began documenting global health issues,

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:47.531
concentrating first on AIDS in Africa.

00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:50.700
I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.700
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.146
whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.

00:14:59.146 --> 00:15:01.700
So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.700
that grandmothers have taken the place of parents,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.700
and a lot of children had been born with HIV.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.700
A hospital in Zambia.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.700
I began documenting the close connection

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.700
between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.700
This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.038
My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs

00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:34.700
by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.700
I went to Congo with MSF,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.700
and contributed to a book and an exhibition

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.700
that focused attention on a forgotten war

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.700
in which millions of people have died,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.700
and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.700
A malnourished child being measured

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.700
as part of the supplemental feeding program.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.700
In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.700
This time I was on assignment for a magazine,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.700
but again worked closely with MSF.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.700
The international community still hasn't found a way

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.700
to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:15.700
An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.

00:16:17.054 --> 00:16:21.700
I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.

00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:24.700
This is a scene from New Orleans.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.038
A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama

00:16:29.038 --> 00:16:32.700
was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.700
This experience raised a lot of questions,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.700
among them questions about race and equality

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.700
and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.700
In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:53.131
I didn't see either of the planes hit,

00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:56.700
and when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.700
and I thought it might have been an accident.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.700
A few minutes later when I looked again

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.700
and saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.700
In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:14.700
I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 --

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.346
not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:22.315
At the time I was photographing in these different places,

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:24.346
I thought I was covering separate stories,

00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:27.700
but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.946
I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.700
and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.700
The central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.700
at the end of the civil war,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.700
shortly before the city fell to the Taliban.

00:17:47.085 --> 00:17:49.700
Land mine victims being helped

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.700
at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.315
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.

00:17:57.315 --> 00:18:00.700
I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.700
from political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.700
I understood that in its suffering,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.700
the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?

00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:17.700
A Taliban fighter shot during a battle

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.700
as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.

00:18:27.438 --> 00:18:29.700
When war with Iraq was imminent,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.700
I realized the American troops would be very well covered,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.700
so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.700
A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.700
that killed several members of a single family.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.700
A day after American forces entered Baghdad,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.700
a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.700
and were cheered on by the crowds --

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.700
a hopeful moment that was short lived.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.069
For the first time in years,

00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:04.392
Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage

00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:06.700
to Karbala to observe Ashura,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.285
and I was amazed by the sheer number of people

00:19:09.285 --> 00:19:11.700
and how fervently they practiced their religion.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.700
A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.700
It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.700
and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.392
Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,

00:19:32.392 --> 00:19:34.700
from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:38.408
This is a helicopter medic giving CPR

00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:40.700
to a soldier who had been shot in the head.

00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:45.285
Military medicine has become so efficient

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:49.100
that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.700
is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.

00:19:54.346 --> 00:19:57.700
The signature weapon of the war is the IED,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.700
and the signature wound is severe leg damage.

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:05.269
After enduring extreme pain and trauma,

00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:07.700
the wounded face a grueling physical

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.700
and psychological struggle in rehab.

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:15.700
The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.

00:20:16.238 --> 00:20:18.700
I tried to imagine myself in their place,

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.700
and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.700
in the face of such catastrophic loss.

00:20:26.162 --> 00:20:31.700
Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:37.700
One day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.038
and all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go."

00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:43.700
And they went surfing.

00:20:47.285 --> 00:20:50.700
Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.700
to show people what's going on.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.700
Sometimes they put their lives on the line,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.700
because they believe your opinions and your influence matter.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.700
They aim their pictures at your best instincts,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.700
generosity, a sense of right and wrong,

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.700
the ability and the willingness to identify with others,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.700
the refusal to accept the unacceptable.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.700
My TED wish:

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.700
there's a vital story that needs to be told,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.700
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.700
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.700
to use news photography in the digital era.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.700
Thank you very much.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:49.700
(Applause)
