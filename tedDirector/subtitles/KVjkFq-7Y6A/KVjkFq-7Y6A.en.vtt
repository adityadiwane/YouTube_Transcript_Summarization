Reviewer: Morton Bast

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:17.045
What I do is I organize information.

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:18.476
I'm a graphic designer.

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.545
Professionally, I try to make sense

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.174
often of things that don't
make much sense themselves.

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:29.312
So my father might not understand
what it is that I do for a living.

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.589
His part of my ancestry has been farmers.

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.713
He's part of this ethnic minority
called the Pontic Greeks.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.652
They lived in Asia Minor
and fled to Greece after a genocide

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:41.196
about a hundred years ago.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:46.083
And ever since that, migration
has somewhat been a theme in my family.

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:50.608
My father moved to Germany,
studied there and married,

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:55.060
and as a result, I now have
this half-German brain,

00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:58.442
with all the analytical thinking
and that slightly dorky demeanor

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.445
that come with that.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.555
And of course it meant
that I was a foreigner in both countries,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.929
and that of course made it pretty easy
for me to migrate as well,

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:10.376
in good family tradition, if you like.

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:14.257
But of course, most journeys
that we undertake from day to day

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.907
are within a city.

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.703
And, especially if you know the city,

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:22.725
getting from A to B
may seem pretty obvious, right?

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:26.877
But the question is, why is it obvious?

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.783
How do we know where we're going?

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:33.068
So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port
about 12 years ago,

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.484
a professional foreigner, if you like,

00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:38.610
and I'm sure you've all had
this experience before, yeah?

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.722
You arrive in a new city,

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:44.719
and your brain is trying
to make sense of this new place.

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:48.121
Once you find your base, your home,

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:52.581
you start to build this cognitive map
of your environment.

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:56.493
It's essentially this virtual map
that only exists in your brain.

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.278
All animal species do it,

00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:01.277
even though we all use
slightly different tools.

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:07.326
Us humans, of course, we don't move around
marking our territory by scent, like dogs.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.842
We don't run around emitting
ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.863
We just don't do that,

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:18.133
although a night in the Temple Bar
district can get pretty wild.

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:19.505
(Laughter)

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.443
No, we do two important things
to make a place our own.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.519
First, we move along linear routes.

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:29.013
Typically, we find a main street,

00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:32.607
and this main street becomes
a linear strip map in our minds.

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.854
But our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:38.233
Every street is generally perceived
as a straight line,

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.989
and we kind of ignore the little twists
and turns that the streets make.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.820
When we do, however,
make a turn into a side street,

00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:50.134
our mind tends to adjust that turn
to a 90-degree angle.

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:52.856
This of course makes for
some funny moments

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.206
when you're in some old city layout

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.222
that follows some sort
of circular city logic, yeah?

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.334
Maybe you've had that experience as well.

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:05.454
Let's say you're on some spot
on a side street

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.820
that projects from a main
cathedral square,

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:12.036
and you want to get to another point
on a side street just like that.

00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:16.514
The cognitive map
in your mind may tell you,

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:19.939
"Aris, go back to the main
cathedral square,

00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:23.676
take a 90-degree turn
and walk down that other side street."

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.135
But somehow you feel adventurous that day,
and you suddenly discover

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.011
that the two spots were actually
only a single building apart.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:34.376
Now, I don't know about you,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.524
but I always feel
like I find this wormhole

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:39.321
or this inter-dimensional portal.

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:40.619
(Laughter)

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:44.150
So we move along linear routes

00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:50.196
and our mind straightens streets
and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.165
The second thing that we do
to make a place our own

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.352
is we attach meaning
and emotions to the things

00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:00.241
that we see along those lines.

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:06.132
If you go to the Irish countryside
and you ask an old lady for directions,

00:04:06.156 --> 00:04:10.044
brace yourself for some
elaborate Irish storytelling

00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:12.022
about all the landmarks, yeah?

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:15.297
She'll tell you the pub
where her sister used to work,

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.692
and "... go past that church
where I got married," that kind of thing.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.772
So we fill our cognitive maps
with these markers of meaning.

00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:28.930
What's more, we abstract
repeat patterns and recognize them.

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:34.373
We recognize them by the experiences
and we abstract them into symbols.

00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:39.495
And of course, we're all capable
of understanding these symbols.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:40.995
(Laughter)

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:45.502
What's more, we're all capable
of understanding the cognitive maps,

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:51.244
and you are all capable of creating
these cognitive maps yourselves.

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:54.861
So next time, when you want to tell
your friend how to get to your place,

00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:59.653
you grab a beermat, grab a napkin,
and you just observe yourself

00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:04.044
create this awesome piece
of communication design.

00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:05.480
It's got straight lines.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:07.982
It's got 90-degree corners.

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.106
You might add little symbols
along the way.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.249
And when you look
at what you've just drawn,

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:18.811
you realize it does not
resemble a street map.

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:23.110
If you were to put an actual street map
on top of what you've just drawn,

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:27.699
you'd realize your streets
and the distances -- they'd be way off.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.092
No, what you've just drawn
is more like a diagram or a schematic.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:39.063
It's a visual construct
of lines, dots, letters,

00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:41.499
designed in the language of our brains.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.835
So it's no big surprise

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:48.818
that the big information-design icon
of the last century --

00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:53.175
the pinnacle of showing everybody
how to get from A to B,

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.217
the London Underground map --

00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:59.554
was not designed by a cartographer
or a city planner;

00:05:59.578 --> 00:06:03.252
it was designed
by an engineering draftsman.

00:06:03.974 --> 00:06:05.684
In the 1930s,

00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:11.860
Harry Beck applied the principles
of schematic diagram design

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:15.760
and changed the way public transport
maps are designed forever.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.225
Now the very key
to the success of this map

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.309
is in the omission
of less important information

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.028
and in the extreme simplification.

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:30.988
So, straightened streets,
corners of 90 and 45 degrees,

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:37.132
but also the extreme geographic
distortion in that map.

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:41.062
If you were to look at the actual
locations of these stations,

00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:43.101
you'd see they're very different.

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:47.500
But this is all for the clarity
of the public Tube map.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.485
If you, say, wanted to get
from Regent's Park station

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.135
to Great Portland Street,

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.993
the Tube map would tell you:

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:59.629
take the Tube, go to Baker Street,
change over, take another Tube.

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:03.550
Of course, what you don't know
is that the two stations

00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:06.118
are only about a hundred meters apart.

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:09.029
Now we've reached the subject
of public transport,

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:12.097
and public transport here in Dublin

00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:14.104
is a somewhat touchy subject.

00:07:14.128 --> 00:07:16.407
(Laughter)

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.644
For everybody who does not know
the public transport here in Dublin,

00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:24.611
essentially, we have this system
of local buses that grew with the city.

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:28.259
For every outskirt that was added,
there was another bus route added,

00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:32.013
running from the outskirt
all the way to the city center.

00:07:33.227 --> 00:07:37.196
And as these local buses
approach the city center,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.105
they all run side by side and converge
in pretty much one main street.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:46.708
So when I stepped off
the boat 12 years ago,

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.269
I tried to make sense of that.

00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:54.551
Because exploring a city on foot
only gets you so far.

00:07:55.234 --> 00:08:00.563
But when you explore a foreign
and new public transport system,

00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:04.876
you will build a cognitive map
in your mind in pretty much the same way.

00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:11.095
Typically, you choose yourself
a rapid transport route,

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:14.911
and in your mind, this route
is perceived as a straight line.

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:17.207
And like a pearl necklace,

00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:22.160
all the stations and stops are nicely
and neatly aligned along the line.

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:28.503
And only then you start to discover
some local bus routes

00:08:28.527 --> 00:08:30.242
that would fill in the gaps,

00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:35.113
and that allow for those wormhole,
inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.

00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:40.339
So I tried to make sense,
and when I arrived,

00:08:40.363 --> 00:08:42.903
I was looking for some
information leaflets

00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:46.444
that would help me crack this system
and understand it,

00:08:46.468 --> 00:08:48.179
and I found those brochures.

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.710
(Laughter)

00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:56.079
They were not geographically distorted.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:09:00.083
They had a lot of omission of information,

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:02.474
but unfortunately, the wrong information.

00:09:02.498 --> 00:09:04.248
Say, in the city center --

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:07.499
there were never actually any lines
that showed the routes.

00:09:07.523 --> 00:09:08.667
(Laughter)

00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:13.441
There are actually not even
any stations with names.

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:14.711
(Laughter)

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:20.358
Now, the maps of Dublin transport
have gotten better,

00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:25.548
and after I finished the project,
they got a good bit better,

00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:28.068
but still no station names,
still no routes.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:34.745
So, being naive,
and being half-German, I decided,

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:37.285
"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:39.187
So that's what I did.

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:45.199
I researched how each and every bus route
moved through the city, nice and logical,

00:09:45.223 --> 00:09:47.208
every bus route a separate line.

00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:51.295
I plotted it into my own map of Dublin,

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:53.906
and in the city center ...

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.560
I got a nice spaghetti plate.

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:58.112
(Laughter)

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:01.185
Now, this is a bit of a mess,

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:03.359
so I decided, of course,

00:10:03.383 --> 00:10:06.938
"You're going to apply
the rules of schematic design,"

00:10:06.962 --> 00:10:08.823
cleaning up the corridors,

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:11.602
widening the streets
where there were loads of buses

00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:16.411
and making the streets at straight,
90-degree corners, 45-degree corners

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:17.864
or fractions of that,

00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:20.874
and filled it in with the bus routes.

00:10:20.898 --> 00:10:24.197
And I built this city center
bus map of the system,

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:26.053
how it was five years ago.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.972
I'll zoom in again
so that you get the full impact

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:31.322
of the quays and Westmoreland Street.

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:34.013
(Laughter)

00:10:34.037 --> 00:10:36.027
Now I can proudly say --

00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:42.379
(Applause)

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:46.584
I can proudly say,
as a public transport map,

00:10:46.608 --> 00:10:50.540
this diagram is an utter failure.

00:10:50.564 --> 00:10:52.451
(Laughter)

00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:54.510
Except, probably, in one aspect:

00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:57.162
I now had a great visual representation

00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:01.058
of just how clogged up and overrun
the city center really was.

00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:04.407
Now, call me old-fashioned,

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:07.914
but I think a public transport
route map should have lines,

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.031
because that's what they are, yeah?

00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:13.271
They're little pieces of string
that wrap their way

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:15.484
through the city center
or through the city.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:21.490
If you will, the Greek guy inside of me
feels if I don't get a line,

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.583
it's like entering
the labyrinth of the Minotaur

00:11:24.607 --> 00:11:27.871
without having Ariadne giving you
the string to find your way.

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:31.838
So the outcome of my academic research,

00:11:31.862 --> 00:11:38.635
loads of questionnaires, case studies
and looking at a lot of maps,

00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:41.072
was that a lot of the problems
and shortcomings

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:43.418
of the public transport
system here in Dublin

00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:45.848
was the lack of a coherent
public transport map --

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.589
a simplified, coherent
public transport map --

00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:52.028
because I think this is the crucial
step to understanding

00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:55.249
a public transport network
on a physical level,

00:11:55.273 --> 00:11:59.568
but it's also the crucial step to make
a public transport network mappable

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.100
on a visual level.

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:05.509
So I teamed up with a gentleman
called James Leahy,

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:08.844
a civil engineer and a recent
master's graduate

00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:12.178
of the Sustainable Development
program at DIT,

00:12:12.202 --> 00:12:16.505
and together we drafted
the simplified model network,

00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:19.807
which I could then go ahead and visualize.

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:21.862
So here's what we did.

00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:28.176
We distributed these rapid-transport
corridors throughout the city center,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.615
and extended them into the outskirts.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.291
Rapid, because we wanted them to be served
by rapid-transport vehicles.

00:12:37.315 --> 00:12:41.225
They would get exclusive
road use, where possible,

00:12:41.249 --> 00:12:43.804
and it would be high-quantity,
high-quality transport.

00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:46.506
James wanted to use
bus rapid transport for that,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.960
rather than light rail.

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:50.111
For me, it was important

00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:54.533
that the vehicles that would run
on those rapid transport corridors

00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:58.973
would be visibly distinguishable
from local buses on the street.

00:12:59.973 --> 00:13:03.015
Now we could take out all the local buses

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:06.112
that ran alongside
those rapid transport means.

00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:09.628
Any gaps that appeared
in the outskirts were filled again.

00:13:09.652 --> 00:13:12.865
So, in other words,
if there was a street in an outskirt

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:15.952
where there had been a bus,
we put a bus back in,

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:20.407
only now these buses wouldn't run
all the way to the city center,

00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:23.971
but connect to the nearest
rapid-transport mode,

00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:26.156
one of these thick lines over there.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.325
So the rest was merely
a couple of months of work,

00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:31.448
and a couple of fights with my girlfriend,

00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:35.424
of our place constantly
being clogged up with maps,

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.441
and the outcome, one of the outcomes,

00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:40.698
was this map of the Greater Dublin area.

00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:42.308
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:47.855
This map only shows the rapid
transport connections, no local bus,

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:53.129
very much in the "metro map" style
that was so successful in London,

00:13:53.153 --> 00:13:57.425
and that since has been exported
to so many other major cities,

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:00.230
and therefore is the language
that we should use

00:14:00.254 --> 00:14:02.417
for public transport maps.

00:14:03.123 --> 00:14:08.640
What's also important is,
with a simplified network like this,

00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:14.142
it now would become possible for me
to tackle the ultimate challenge

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:17.739
and make a public transport map
for the city center,

00:14:17.763 --> 00:14:20.859
one where I wouldn't just show
rapid transport connections,

00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:24.357
but also all the local bus routes,
streets and the likes,

00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:26.691
and this is what a map
like this could look like.

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:28.302
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:36.228
In this map, I'm including
each transport mode,

00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:41.117
so rapid transport, bus,
DART, tram and the likes.

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:47.160
Each individual route
is represented by a separate line.

00:14:48.493 --> 00:14:52.649
The map shows each and every station,

00:14:52.673 --> 00:14:55.978
each and every station name,

00:14:56.002 --> 00:15:00.252
and I'm also displaying side streets.

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:04.257
In fact, most of the side streets
even with their name,

00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:09.208
and for good measure,
also a couple of landmarks,

00:15:09.232 --> 00:15:11.406
some of them signified by little symbols,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.519
others by these isometric
three-dimensional

00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:16.541
bird's-eye-view drawings.

00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:19.198
The map is relatively small
in overall size,

00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:22.363
so something that you could
still hold as a fold-out map

00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:26.045
or display in a reasonably-sized
display box on a bus shelter.

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:30.713
I think it tries to be the best balance

00:15:30.737 --> 00:15:34.069
between actual representation
and simplification --

00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:39.236
the language of way-finding in our brain.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.791
So, straightened lines,
cleaned-up corners,

00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:46.481
and of course, that very, very
important geographic distortion

00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:50.029
that makes public transport maps possible.

00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:52.791
If you, for example, have a look
at the two main corridors

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:56.087
that run through the city --
the yellow and orange one over here --

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:59.689
this is how they look in an actual,
accurate street map,

00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:03.698
and this is how they would
look in my distorted,

00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:06.137
simplified public transport map.

00:16:06.676 --> 00:16:09.578
So for a successful public transport map,

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:12.356
we should not stick
to accurate representation,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.741
but design them in the way
our brains work.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:18.036
The reactions I got were tremendous,
it was really good to see.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.752
And of course, for my own self,
I was very happy to see

00:16:21.776 --> 00:16:25.174
that my folks in Germany and Greece
finally have an idea

00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:26.377
what I do for a living.

00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:27.403
(Laughter)

00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:28.578
Thank you.

00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:30.799
(Applause)
