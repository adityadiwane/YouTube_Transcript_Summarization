00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So I was born

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
on the last day

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
of the last year of the '70s.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
(cheering)

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
hip-hop --

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop --

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and Anita Hill.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
(Cheering)

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
My parents were radicals --

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
(Laughter)

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
who became,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
well, grown-ups.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
My dad facetiously says,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
"We wanted to save the world,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
and instead we just got rich."

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
We actually just got "middle class"

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but you get the picture.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I was raised with a very heavy sense

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
of unfinished legacy.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
At this ripe old age of 30,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
in this horrible, beautiful time,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and I've decided, for me,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
it's been a real journey and paradox.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
The first paradox

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
is that growing up is about rejecting the past

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and then promptly reclaiming it.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Feminism was the water I grew up in.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
When I was just a little girl,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
my mom started what is now

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
the longest-running women's film festival in the world.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I was watching very esoteric documentaries

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
made by and about women.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
You can see how this had an influence.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But she was not the only feminist in the house.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
My dad actually resigned

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
from the male-only business club in my hometown

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
because he said he would never be part of an organization

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.260
(Applause)

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
He's actually here today.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
(Applause)

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
The trick here

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
is my brother would become an experimental poet,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
not a businessman,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
but the intention was really good.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
(Laughter)

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
even though it was all around me,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
because I associated it with my mom's women's groups,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
none of which had much cachet

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
in the hallways of Palmer High School

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
where I was trying to be cool at the time.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
But I suspected there was something really important

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
about this whole feminism thing,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.260
so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and picking books off and reading them --

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
I didn't actually claim the feminist label

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
until I went to Barnard College

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
was responsible for my feminist click moment?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Fishnet stockings.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I thought they were really hot.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Now I tell you this --

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
because I think part of the work of feminism

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
that fun do matter.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
There are lots of very modern political movements

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
that have caught fire in no small part

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
because of cultural hipness.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but it looks very different.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
My mom says, "patriarchy."

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I say, "intersectionality."

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So race, class, gender, ability,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
all of these things go into our experiences

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
of what it means to be a woman.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
But for me, so is immigration. (Applause)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Thank you.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
My mom says, "Protest march."

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I say, "Online organizing."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I co-edit, along with a collective

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
of other super-smart, amazing women,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
a site called Feministing.com.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.260
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and I tell you this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
because I think it's really important to see

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
that there's a continuum.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
of consciousness raising.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
But we also have a straightforward political impact.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Feministing has been able

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
fired from a Big Ten school.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And one of our biggest successes

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So we're able to pull in the next generation

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
in a totally new way.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem."

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and on and on and on and on."

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
We don't want one hero.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
We don't want one icon.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We don't want one face.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
We are thousands of women and men across this country

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
doing online writing, community organizing,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
changing institutions from the inside out --

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
all continuing the incredible work

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
that our mothers and grandmothers started.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Thank you.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
(Applause)

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Which brings me to the second paradox:

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
sobering up about our smallness

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
and maintaining faith in our greatness

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
all at once.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Many in my generation --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
were socialized to believe

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
that we were special little snowflakes --

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
(Laughter)

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
who were going to go out and save the world.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
These are three words many of us were raised with.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
We walk across graduation stages,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
high on our overblown expectations,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and when we float back down to earth,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
we realize we don't know what the heck it means

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to actually save the world anyway.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
The mainstream media often paints my generation

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
as apathetic,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and I think it's much more accurate

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to say we are deeply overwhelmed.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair --

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
an environmental crisis,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
wealth disparity in this country

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
unlike we've seen since 1928,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
and globally,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
I experienced this firsthand myself

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
I went out and I worked at a non-profit,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
I went to grad school, I phone-banked,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
I protested, I volunteered,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and none of it seemed to matter.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And on a particularly dark night

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
of December of 2004,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
I sat down with my family,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and I said that I had become very disillusioned.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
of writing a letter

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
about everything that was wrong with the world

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
and then lighting myself on fire

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
on the White House steps.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
My mom

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260
took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
her eyes really welled with tears,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and she looked right at me and she said,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
"I will not stand

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
for your desperation."

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
She said, "You are smarter, more creative

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
and more resilient than that."

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Which brings me to my third paradox.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and being fulfilled by failing really well.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
(Laughter)

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
(Applause)

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and a servile underestimation of ourselves."

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
You may have guessed by now,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I did not light myself on fire.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
I wrote the book I needed to read.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I wrote a book about eight incredible people

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
all over this country

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
doing social justice work.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
who's dedicating her life

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
to environmental justice.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
I wrote about Emily Apt

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
but quickly learned, not only did she not like it,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
but she wasn't really good at it.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So she made a film about the welfare system

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
and had a huge impact.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.260
who joined the military so she could afford college.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
and went on to co-organize a group

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
called the Service Women's Action Network.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
What I learned from these people and others

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
was that I couldn't judge them

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems --

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the military, congress,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
the education system, etc.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
But what they managed to do within those systems

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
was be a humanizing force.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And at the end of the day,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
what could possibly be more important than that?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
But how good a failure is it?"

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
It's to say we operate on two levels.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
On one,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
we really go after changing these broken systems

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
of which we find ourselves a part.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
But on the other, we root our self-esteem

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
more kind, more just, etc.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So when I was a little girl,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
I had a couple of very strange habits.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
One of them was

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and I would suck the thumb of my left hand

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
(Laughter)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
She was talking about board meetings,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
she was founding peace organizations,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
all these daily acts of care and creativity.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
And surely, at three and four years old,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
The activists I interviewed

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
which was that they all cited their mothers

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
as their most looming and important

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
activist influences.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
So often, particularly at a young age,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
we look far afield

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
for our models of the meaningful life,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
and sometimes they're in our own kitchens,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
talking on the phone, making us dinner,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.260
doing all that keeps the world going around and around.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
My mom and so many women like her

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
have taught me that life is not about glory,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
or certainty, or security even.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
It's about embracing the paradox.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
And it's about loving people really well.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And at the end of the day,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
these things make for a lifetime

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
of challenge and reward.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Thank you.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
(Applause)
