00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
This is your conference,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.160
Two years ago at TED, I think --

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
I've come to this conclusion --

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
I think that I may have believed unconsciously,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
then, that I was kind of a business hero.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.160
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
it was a magazine publishing company.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
It had recently gone public

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
a number I didn't really understand.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.160
A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
was fatter than a telephone directory,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
busy pumping hot air into the bubble.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
(Laughter)

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160
And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
And all this had come from nothing.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160
when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160
and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
The date was February 2000.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
I thought the little graph of my business life

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.160
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
The dotcom, ironically called Snowball,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
was the very last consumer web company to go public

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:36.160
the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
and 15 years work would have come for nothing.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And it was gut wrenching.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.160
It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
something which I was very proud of in the business.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
from my companies. I felt sick.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I watched my own net worth falling

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And worse than that, far worse than that,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160
(Laughter)

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.160
And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.160
is how the hell did I let my personal happiness

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
get so tied up with this business thing?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
but I was, at that point, ready to move on.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.160
that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
This has been a big, big transition time,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.160
and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
The theme next year is re-birth.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.160
It was at the same TED two years ago

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
I started to read again.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.160
cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
to ... all this stuff had changed.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
And the way in which you could think about us as a species

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.160
and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And what was really most exciting --

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.160
and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
was that all this stuff is connected.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
It's connected; it all hooks into each other.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
We talk about this a lot,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.160
Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
And she answered, "A penis."

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
And when you think about it, it's very true:

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
what we all most desire is a penis --

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
or "happiness" as we say in English.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.160
(Laughter)

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
(Laughter)

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
(Applause)

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.160
But something as basic as happiness,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
in the church or mosque or synagogue,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160
today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
You can ask about what causes it biochemically:

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.160
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
do you need to incorporate

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160
and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.160
are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
and whereas almost all the rest of them,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160
regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
are almost equally happy on average?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.160
Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
did our genes invent this as a kind of trick

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160
to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Are we the victims of a mass delusion?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And so on, and so on.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.160
To understand even something as important to us as happiness,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.160
and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.160
where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160
to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
a little bit about everything that surrounds it.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And so, gradually over these three days,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160
you start off kind of trying to figure out,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
And at the end of the four days,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.160
your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
and it's because all these different bits have been put together.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160
It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160
(Laughter)

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Every mental organ addressed. It really is.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160
"Chris, TED is a really great conference.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
(Laughter)

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:27.160
So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
and I will promise you right here and now

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
no bandwagoning, no platforms.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160
Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160
across all the disciplines that are represented here.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
That's not going to be changed at all.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Number two: I am going to put together

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
an incredible line up of speakers for next year.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
There's a year to do this, and already --

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
I hope to show you a bit later --

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160
there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.160
reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
It's true.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:43.160
Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.160
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.160
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.160
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
They may well be by a TED speaker,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
and so we can get the conversation going during the year

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.160
and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160
I think it will be great.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
which is the new owner of TED.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.160
will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:46.160
And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.160
are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Already, just in the last few days,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
and the idea of getting this group of people together --

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
some of the causes that we believe in,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.160
I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160
I'm incredibly excited about that.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:22.160
In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
I'm in this for the long run,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
and I would be greatly honored and excited

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
if you'll come on this journey with me.
