00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm a writer and a journalist,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and I'm also an insanely curious person,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
so in 22 years as a journalist,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
was to become invisible.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
I became one of the working homeless.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I quit my job as a newspaper editor

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
after my father died in February of that same year,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and decided to travel.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
His death hit me pretty hard.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
I've camped my whole life. And I decided

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that living in a van for a year to do this

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
would be like one long camping trip.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and drove off into the sunset,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.260
having fully failed to realize three critical things.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
One: that society equates

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
living in a permanent structure, even a shack,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
with having value as a person.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Two: I failed to realize how quickly

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
the negative perceptions of other people

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
can impact our reality, if we let it.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Three: I failed to realize

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that homelessness is an attitude,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
not a lifestyle.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
At first, living in the van was great.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I had time to relax and to grieve.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to pay the bills.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
What had been a really mild spring

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
turned into a miserably hot summer.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And it became impossible to park anywhere --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.260
(Laughs)

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
-- without being very obvious

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
The doggy went into doggy day care.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And I sweated.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Whenever I could, I used

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
making it difficult or impossible to sleep.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Food rotted in the heat.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and it was pretty miserable.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
I couldn't afford to find an apartment,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
to have the Rottweiler and the cat.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And I refused to give them up,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.260
so I stayed in the van.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And when the heat made me too sick

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
outside my van at night,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
below freezing. And they stayed there.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
I parked a different place every night

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
I didn't always succeed.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.260
But I felt out of control of my life.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And I don't know when or how it happened,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
but the speed at which I went

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
from being a talented writer and journalist

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
to being a homeless woman, living in a van,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
took my breath away.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.260
My talent, my integrity, my values,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
everything about me remained the same.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But I had changed somehow.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
I just wasn't drunk or high.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And when several of the homeless men realized that,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
including a former university professor,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
but I did.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
"You have a job. You have hope.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.260
The real homeless don't have hope."

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.260
"If I killed myself, no one would notice."

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.260
A friend told me, shortly after that,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that she had heard that Tim Russert,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
a nationally renowned journalist,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
had been talking about me on national T.V.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
An essay I'd written about my father,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.260
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
was talking about my writing,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
I started laughing.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
You should too.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260
(Laughter)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
I started laughing

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
because it got to the point where,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And I cried.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Because I was a writer.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
I was a writer.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And I started writing again.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
I was no longer homeless.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And I was no longer invisible.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and live in their cars.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
living in your vehicle or on the streets.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.260
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
But if you ever meet one,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.260
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
people are not where they live,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
where they sleep,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.260
or what their life situation is at any given time.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Three years ago I was living in a van

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and today I'm speaking at TED.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.260
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
(Applause)
