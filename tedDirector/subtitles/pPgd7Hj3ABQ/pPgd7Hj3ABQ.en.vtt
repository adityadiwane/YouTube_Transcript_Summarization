00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.721
I want to tell you
about the future of money.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.064
Let's start with a story
about this culture

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:23.276
that lived in Micronesia
in the early 1900s, called the Yap.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.083
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:27.973
because their form of money
is really interesting.

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:31.635
They use these limestone discs
called Rai stones.

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.386
Now, the Yap don't actually
move these Rai stones around

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.207
or exchange them the way
we do with our coins,

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:41.696
because Rai stones can get
to be pretty massive.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.048
The largest is about four tons
and 12 feet across.

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:51.153
So the Yap just keep track
of who owns part of what stone.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.138
There's a story about these sailors

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.818
that were transporting a stone
across the ocean

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.668
when they ran into some trouble
and the stone actually fell in.

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.896
The sailors got back to the main island

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.177
and they told everyone what had happened.

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:08.950
And everyone decided that, actually, yes,

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:13.348
the sailors had the stone
and -- why not? -- it still counted.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.566
Even though it was
at the bottom of the ocean,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.745
it was still part of the Yap economy.

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:21.742
You might think that this
was just a small culture

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.134
a hundred years ago.

00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:26.306
But things like this happen
in the Western world as well,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.689
and the Yap actually still use
a form of these stones.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.788
In 1932, the Bank of France
asked the United States

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:38.376
to convert their holdings
from dollars into gold.

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.094
But it was too inconvenient
to think about actually shipping

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:44.047
all of that gold over to Europe.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.904
So instead, someone went to where
that gold was being stored

00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:51.982
and they just labeled it
as belonging to France now.

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.474
And everyone agreed
that France owned the gold.

00:01:55.843 --> 00:01:57.825
It's just like those Rai stones.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.838
The point I want to make
with these two examples

00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:04.250
is that there's nothing
inherently valuable

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:07.635
about a dollar or a stone or a coin.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.782
The only reason these things
have any value

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:13.374
is because we've all decided they should.

00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:15.227
And because we've decided that,

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:16.420
they do.

00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:21.363
Money is about the exchanges
and the transactions

00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:23.448
that we have with each other.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.850
Money isn't anything objective.

00:02:26.874 --> 00:02:31.271
It's about a collective story
that we tell each other about value.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:33.482
A collective fiction.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.053
And that's a really powerful concept.

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.526
In the past two decades,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.819
we've begun to use digital money.

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:44.516
So I get paid via direct deposit,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.023
I pay my rent via bank transfer,

00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:48.991
I pay my taxes online.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:50.167
And every month,

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:52.956
a small amount of money
is deducted from my paycheck

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.947
and invested in mutual funds
in my retirement account.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.629
All of these interactions

00:02:58.653 --> 00:03:02.711
are literally just changing
1's and 0's on computers.

00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:07.109
There's not even anything physical,
like a stone or a coin.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.603
Digital money makes it
so that I can pay someone around the world

00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:13.008
in seconds.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.492
Now when this works,

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:20.361
it's because there are large institutions
underwriting every 1 or 0

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:22.314
that changes on a computer.

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:23.503
And when it doesn't,

00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.925
it's often the fault
of those large institutions.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.892
Or at least, it's up to them
to fix the problem.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:30.476
And a lot of times, they don't.

00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:33.031
There's a lot of friction in the system.

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:36.813
How long did it take
the US credit card companies

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:38.413
to implement chip and pin?

00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:42.014
Half my credit cards
still don't work in Europe.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.936
That's friction.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.472
Transferring money across borders
and across currencies

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:50.140
is really expensive:

00:03:50.807 --> 00:03:52.268
friction.

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:57.215
An entrepreneur in India
can set up an online business in minutes,

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.768
but it's hard for her
to get loans and to get paid:

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.666
friction.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:08.545
Our access to digital money
and our ability to freely transact

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.512
is being held captive
by these gatekeepers.

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:15.352
And there's a lot of impediments
in the system slowing things down.

00:04:16.498 --> 00:04:20.040
That's because digital money
isn't really mine,

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:23.638
it's entries in databases
that belong to my bank,

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:26.815
my credit card company
or my investment firm.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:30.203
And these companies
have the right to say "no."

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:32.648
If I'm a PayPal merchant

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:37.143
and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:38.323
that's it.

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:41.634
My account gets frozen,
and I can't get paid.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.837
These institutions are standing
in the way of innovation.

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:54.346
How many of you use
Facebook photos, Google Photos,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.953
Instagram?

00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:58.323
My photos are everywhere.

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.832
They are on my phone,
they're on my laptop,

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:03.372
they're on my old phone,
they're in Dropbox.

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:06.228
They're on all these different
websites and services.

00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:10.156
And most of these services
don't work together.

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:12.320
They don't inter-operate.

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:15.031
And as a result,

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:17.265
my photo library is a mess.

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.211
The same thing happens

00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:23.194
when institutions control
the money supply.

00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:26.697
A lot of these services
don't inter-operate,

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:30.161
and as a result, this blocks
what we can do with payment.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.735
And it makes transaction costs go up.

00:05:33.723 --> 00:05:37.025
So far, we've been through
two phases of money.

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:41.916
In an analog world, we had
to deal with these physical objects,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.819
and money moved at a certain speed --
the speed of humans.

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:51.765
In a digital world, money can reach
much farther and is much faster,

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.819
but we're at the mercy
of these gatekeeper institutions.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:58.210
Money only moves at the speed of banks.

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:02.562
We're about to enter a new phase of money.

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:05.868
The future of money is programmable.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:10.461
When we combine software and currency,

00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:14.262
money becomes more
than just a static unit of value,

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:17.476
and we don't have to rely
on institutions for security.

00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:19.705
In a programmable world,

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.663
we remove humans
and institutions from the loop.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.969
And when this happens,

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:28.685
we won't even feel like
we're transacting anymore.

00:06:29.683 --> 00:06:31.957
Money will be directed by software,

00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:34.849
and it will just safely and securely flow.

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:39.967
Cryptocurrencies are the first step
of this evolution.

00:06:40.787 --> 00:06:42.442
Cryptocurrencies are digital money

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:45.334
that isn't run by any government or bank.

00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:49.419
It's money designed to work
in a world without intermediaries.

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:53.186
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous
cryptocurrency,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.907
but there are hundreds of them.

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:58.408
There's Ethereum, Litecoin,
Stellar, Dogecoin,

00:06:58.432 --> 00:07:00.978
and those are just a few
of the more popular ones.

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:04.009
And these things are real money.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.362
The sushi restaurant down my street

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:07.541
takes Bitcoin.

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:12.091
I have an app on my phone
that I can use to buy sashimi.

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.429
But it's not just for small transactions.

00:07:15.453 --> 00:07:20.282
In March, there was a transaction
that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.711
That's the equivalent
of 40 million US dollars.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.976
Cryptocurrencies are based on
a special field of mathematics

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.383
called cryptography.

00:07:31.023 --> 00:07:34.794
Cryptography is the study
of how to secure communication,

00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:37.517
and it's about two
really important things:

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:41.119
masking information so it can
be hidden in plain sight,

00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:44.370
and verifying a piece
of information's source.

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:49.363
Cryptography underpins
so many of the systems around us.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:51.913
And it's so powerful that at times

00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:55.589
the US government has actually
classified it as a weapon.

00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:01.068
During World War II,
breaking cryptosystems like Enigma

00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:04.396
was critical to decoding
enemy transmissions

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.324
and turning the tide of the war.

00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:10.412
Today, anyone with a modern
web browser is running

00:08:10.436 --> 00:08:12.498
a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.991
It's what we use to secure
our interactions on the Internet.

00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:20.176
It's what makes it safe for us
to type our passwords in

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.891
and to send financial
information to websites.

00:08:23.322 --> 00:08:26.149
So what the banks used to give us --

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.393
trustworthy digital money transfer --

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:32.635
we can now get with a clever
application of cryptography.

00:08:33.202 --> 00:08:36.109
And this means that we don't
have to rely on the banks anymore

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:37.764
to secure our transactions.

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:40.077
We can do it ourselves.

00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:45.596
Bitcoin is based on the very same
idea that the Yap used,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.922
this collective global
knowledge of transfers.

00:08:49.852 --> 00:08:53.464
In Bitcoin, I spend
by transferring Bitcoin,

00:08:53.488 --> 00:08:56.659
and I get paid when someone
transfers Bitcoin to me.

00:08:58.313 --> 00:09:01.068
Imagine that we had this magic paper.

00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.299
So the way that this paper works
is I can give you a sheet of it

00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:07.053
and if you write something on it,

00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:09.700
it will magically appear
on my piece as well.

00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:13.567
Let's say we just give everyone this paper

00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:17.419
and everyone writes down
the transfers that they're doing

00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:18.899
in the Bitcoin system.

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:23.634
All of these transfers get copied
around to everyone else's pieces of paper.

00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:25.676
And I can look at mine

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.225
and I'll have a list of all
of the transfers that are happening

00:09:29.249 --> 00:09:31.138
in the entire Bitcoin economy.

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:35.341
This is actually what's happening
with the Bitcoin blockchain,

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:39.161
which is a list of all
of the transactions in Bitcoin.

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:41.999
Except, it's not done through paper.

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:43.719
It's done through computer code,

00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.406
running on thousands
of networked computers

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.638
around the world.

00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:52.979
All of these computers
are collectively confirming

00:09:53.003 --> 00:09:54.887
who owns what Bitcoin.

00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:58.324
So the Bitcoin blockchain
is core to how Bitcoin works.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.253
But where do bitcoins actually come from?

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.790
Well, the code is designed
to create new Bitcoin

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.111
according to a schedule.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.096
And the way that it works
is that to get those Bitcoin,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.906
I have to solve a puzzle --
a random cryptographic puzzle.

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:19.480
Imagine that we had 15 dice,

00:10:19.504 --> 00:10:22.117
and we were throwing these dice
over and over again.

00:10:22.603 --> 00:10:25.035
Whenever the dice come up all sixes,

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:26.274
we say that we win.

00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:30.971
This is very close to what these computers
are all actually doing.

00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:34.243
They're trying over and over again
to land on the right number.

00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.043
And when they do,

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:38.268
we say that they've solved the puzzle.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.999
The computer that solves the puzzle

00:10:42.023 --> 00:10:44.941
publishes its solution
to the rest of the network

00:10:44.965 --> 00:10:47.892
and collects its reward: new bitcoins.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.984
And in the act of solving this puzzle,

00:10:51.008 --> 00:10:55.084
these computers are actually
helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain

00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:57.189
and add to the list of transactions.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:03.483
There are actually people
all over the world running this software,

00:11:03.507 --> 00:11:05.580
and we call them Bitcoin miners.

00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:09.174
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.

00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:12.417
You can go download the software right now

00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:15.806
and run it in your computer
and try to collect some bitcoins.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.244
I can't say that I would recommend it,

00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:23.369
because right now, the puzzle is so hard
and the network is so powerful,

00:11:23.393 --> 00:11:26.322
that if I tried to mine
Bitcoin on my laptop,

00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:29.654
I probably wouldn't see any
for about two million years.

00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:34.643
The miners, professional miners,
use this special hardware

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:37.402
that's designed to solve
the puzzle really fast.

00:11:37.976 --> 00:11:41.818
Now, the Bitcoin network
and all of this special hardware,

00:11:41.842 --> 00:11:44.877
there are estimates
that the amount of energy it uses

00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:47.268
is equivalent to that of a small country.

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:50.752
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:53.750
are a little bit slow
and a little bit cumbersome.

00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:58.720
But the next generation is going
to be so much better and so much faster.

00:11:58.744 --> 00:12:01.149
Cryptocurrencies are the first step

00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:04.633
to a world with a global
programmable money.

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:07.719
And in a world with programmable money,

00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:11.958
I can pay anyone else securely

00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:15.555
without having to sign up
or ask permission,

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:19.398
or do a conversion or worry
about my money getting stuck.

00:12:20.428 --> 00:12:23.022
And I can send money around the world.

00:12:23.482 --> 00:12:25.881
This is a really amazing thing.

00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:29.540
It's the idea of permission-less innovation.

00:12:31.447 --> 00:12:35.171
The Internet caused
an explosion of innovation,

00:12:35.195 --> 00:12:38.654
because it was built upon
an open architecture.

00:12:39.286 --> 00:12:42.311
And just like the Internet
changed the way we communicate,

00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:46.380
programmable money is going
to change the way we pay,

00:12:46.404 --> 00:12:48.978
allocate and decide on value.

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:52.214
So what kind of world
does programmable money create?

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:56.454
Imagine a world where I can
rent out my healthcare data

00:12:56.478 --> 00:12:58.048
to a pharmaceutical company.

00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:01.568
They can run large-scale data analysis

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:03.964
and provide me with a cryptographic proof

00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:08.114
that shows they're only using my data
in a way that we agreed.

00:13:08.138 --> 00:13:10.386
And they can pay me
for what they find out.

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:14.238
Instead of signing up
for streaming services

00:13:14.262 --> 00:13:15.831
and getting a cable bill,

00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:18.861
what if my television analyzed
my watching habits

00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:22.557
and recommended well-priced content
that fit within my budget

00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:23.780
that I would enjoy?

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:27.470
Imagine an Internet without ads,

00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:31.501
because instead of paying
with our attention when we view content,

00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:32.821
we just pay.

00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:36.142
Interestingly, things like micro-payments

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:39.321
are actually going to change
the way security works in our world,

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:42.040
because once we're better able
to allocate value,

00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:45.088
people will use their money
and their energies

00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:47.290
for more constructive things.

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:50.316
If it cost a fraction of a cent
to send an email,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.802
would we still have spam?

00:13:52.674 --> 00:13:54.877
We're not at this world yet,

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:56.358
but it's coming.

00:13:56.382 --> 00:14:00.719
Right now, it's like we're in a world
that is seeing the first automobile.

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:04.564
The first cryptocurrency,
like the first car,

00:14:05.533 --> 00:14:09.260
is slow and hard to understand
and hard to use.

00:14:10.095 --> 00:14:12.641
Digital money,
like the horse and carriage,

00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:14.195
works pretty well,

00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:17.264
and the whole world economy
is built on it.

00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:20.460
If you were the first person on your block

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:23.255
to get a car with an internal
combustion engine,

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.777
your neighbors would probably
think you were crazy:

00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:28.794
"Why would you want
this large, clunky machine

00:14:28.818 --> 00:14:31.723
that breaks down all the time,
that lights on fire,

00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:34.084
and is still slower than a horse?"

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:37.139
But we all know how that story turns out.

00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:42.001
We're entering a new era
of programmable money.

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:45.076
And it's very exciting,
but it's also a little bit scary.

00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:50.205
Cryptocurrencies can be used
for illegal transactions,

00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:53.474
just like cash is used for crime
in the world today.

00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:56.975
When all of our transactions are online,

00:14:56.999 --> 00:15:00.318
what does that mean for surveillance --
who can see what we do?

00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:05.202
Who's advantaged
in this new world and who isn't?

00:15:05.226 --> 00:15:08.900
Will I have to start to pay for things
that I didn't have to pay for before?

00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:13.259
Will we all become slaves
to algorithms and utility functions?

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.518
All new technology comes with trade-offs.

00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:21.901
The Internet brought us
a lot of ways to waste time.

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:25.096
But it also greatly
increased productivity.

00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:27.237
Mobile phones are annoying

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.245
because they make me feel
like I have to stay connected to work

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:31.424
all the time.

00:15:31.448 --> 00:15:34.274
But they also help me stay connected
to friends and family.

00:15:35.274 --> 00:15:39.618
The new sharing economy
is going to eliminate some jobs.

00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:44.059
But it's also going to create
new, flexible forms of employment.

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:46.527
With programmable money,

00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:51.503
we decouple the need
for large, trusted institutions

00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:53.820
from the architecture of the network.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.656
And this pushes innovation in money
out to the edges, where it belongs.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.774
Programmable money democratizes money.

00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:07.219
And because of this,
things are going to change and unfold

00:16:07.243 --> 00:16:09.234
in ways that we can't even predict.

00:16:10.488 --> 00:16:11.650
Thank you.

00:16:11.674 --> 00:16:15.638
(Applause)
