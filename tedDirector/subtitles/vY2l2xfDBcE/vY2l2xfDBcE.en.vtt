00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.274
I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.443
she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:20.379
I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.867
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- "

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:25.610
I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.402
She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:32.355
(Laughter)

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:33.966
So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.021
I'm gonna be good. I am."

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.439
But I am angry. (Laughter)

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.145
And the last time I looked, I'm --

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.952
(Applause)

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:51.380
So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.299
This year, there are going to be millions of our children

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.263
that we're going to needlessly lose,

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:03.853
that we could -- right now, we could save them all.

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.698
You saw the quality of the educators who were here.

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:11.035
Do not tell me they could not reach those kids

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:13.306
and save them. I know they could.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.167
It is absolutely possible.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.550
Why haven't we fixed this?

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.314
Those of us in education have held on to a business plan

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:27.169
that we don't care how many millions of young people fail,

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:30.264
we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,

00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:35.207
and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --

00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:37.352
enough to say, "Enough is enough."

00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:41.736
So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:45.096
You know, I grew up in the inner city,

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:49.983
and there were kids who were failing

00:01:49.983 --> 00:01:56.517
in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:03.291
and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.275
And you know something about a lousy school?

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.891
It's not like a bottle of wine.

00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:09.202
Right? (Laughter)

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.980
Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.096
That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:18.502
it's still the same approach, right?

00:02:18.502 --> 00:02:23.046
One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.721
tough luck. Just tough luck.

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.666
Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.131
Do not tell me we can't do better than this.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.596
Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:40.060
and you say, "So what's the plan?"

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.164
And they say, "We'll, we're going to do

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.180
what we did last year this year."

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.983
What kind of business model is that?

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:53.961
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:59.074
They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:04.007
Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.395
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:10.781
Who created that business model? Right?

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.894
And it went on for decades.

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.809
You know why? Because they didn't care.

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.793
It wasn't about the customers.

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:22.311
It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:24.390
How could you go to the bank

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.799
when you were at work? It didn't matter.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.422
And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:32.011
he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.449
They all operate the same way. Right?

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.312
Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.

00:03:39.312 --> 00:03:43.289
Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.416
They might like that. What about a Saturday?

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:49.384
What about introducing technology?

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.603
Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit

00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:53.944
to you all I'm a little old.

00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:56.897
So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,

00:03:56.897 --> 00:04:00.795
and when they first came out with those new contraptions,

00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:04.465
these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,

00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:08.080
I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.428
I am never using that, right?"

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:16.363
So technology has changed. Things have changed.

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:19.049
Yet not in education. Why?

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.009
Why is it that when we had rotary phones,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.320
when we were having folks being crippled by polio,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.417
that we were teaching

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:33.672
the same way then that we're doing right now?

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:38.080
And if you come up with a plan to change things,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.341
people consider you radical.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.732
They will say the worst things about you.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:46.624
I said one day, well, look, if the science says --

00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:50.283
this is science, not me -- that our poorest children

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:53.593
lose ground in the summertime --

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.695
You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.372
You look at them in September, they've gone down.

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:02.588
You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75

00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:04.219
when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.109
I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:11.119
Because it suggests we should do something.

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:14.684
(Laughter)

00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:17.788
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.

00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:19.411
It says exactly the same thing:

00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:21.677
Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.

00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:26.510
The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.736
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:32.307
For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:33.415
I thought I knew something.

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.496
They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had â€”

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:38.078
but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:41.360
I never got that. I never got that,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.512
because anyone knows if you farm,

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:46.587
you don't plant crops in July and August.

00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:49.336
You plant them in the spring.

00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:53.105
So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:54.788
Why did we ever do it?

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.086
Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,

00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:00.064
schools were open all year. They were open all year,

00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:03.088
because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:04.435
They didn't have any place for their kids to go.

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:06.469
It was a perfect place to have schools.

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.360
So this is not something that is ordained

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.354
from the education gods.

00:06:12.354 --> 00:06:14.530
So why don't we? Why don't we?

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.480
Because our business has refused to use science.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.492
Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,

00:06:23.492 --> 00:06:26.592
"Look, this works, right? We can do this."

00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:31.741
How many places in America are going to change? None.

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.453
None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:39.239
Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:43.784
As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.

00:06:43.784 --> 00:06:46.079
Here's what we know.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:52.054
We know that the problem begins immediately.

00:06:52.054 --> 00:06:55.963
Right? This idea, zero to three.

00:06:55.963 --> 00:06:58.449
My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.956
three grown ones and a 15-year-old.

00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.443
That's a longer story.

00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:05.092
(Laughter)

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.171
With our first kids, we did not know the science

00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:10.011
about brain development.

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.625
We didn't know how critical those first three years were.

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:15.039
We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.593
We didn't know the role that language,

00:07:17.593 --> 00:07:20.484
a stimulus and response, call and response,

00:07:20.484 --> 00:07:23.113
how important that was in developing those children.

00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:27.978
We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.

00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:32.074
Wealthy people know. Educated people know.

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:33.744
And their kids have an advantage.

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.331
Poor people don't know,

00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:38.335
and we're not doing anything to help them at all.

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:39.680
But we know this is critical.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.410
Now, you take pre-kindergarten.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.480
We know it's important for kids.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.854
Poor kids need that experience.

00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:53.783
Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.

00:07:53.783 --> 00:07:56.331
We know health services matter.

00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.928
You know, we provide health services

00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:00.867
and people are always fussing at me about, you know,

00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:04.782
because I'm all into accountability and data

00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:07.976
and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.217
and I have to raise a lot of money.

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:11.034
People used to say when they'd come fund us,

00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:13.813
"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"

00:08:13.813 --> 00:08:15.922
I used to make stuff up. Right?

00:08:15.922 --> 00:08:18.473
I'd say, "Well, you know a child

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:22.226
who has cavities is not going to, uh,

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:24.286
be able to study as well."

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:28.291
And I had to because I had to raise the money.

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.843
But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.585
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits

00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:35.525
and the sports and the recreation and the arts?

00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:39.019
Because I actually like kids.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:44.380
I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.555
But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.651
I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."

00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:53.643
And you've never read a study from MIT that says

00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:56.619
giving your kid dance instruction

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.536
is going to help them do algebra better,

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:01.611
but you will give that kid dance instruction,

00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:05.124
and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:08.445
and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids

00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:13.999
have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.

00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:16.701
(Applause)

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:19.673
So here's the other thing.

00:09:19.673 --> 00:09:23.540
I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.705
because you work at something, you think it's working,

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:28.442
and you find out it's not working.

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.308
I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,

00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:33.353
you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.

00:09:33.353 --> 00:09:35.922
But here's the problem with testing.

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:38.187
The testing that we do --

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:40.906
we're going to have our test in New York next week â€”

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:42.861
is in April.

00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:45.787
You know when we're going to get the results back?

00:09:45.787 --> 00:09:48.954
Maybe July, maybe June.

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:51.762
And the results have great data.

00:09:51.762 --> 00:09:54.839
They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:58.217
couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,

00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:00.746
but you're getting it back after school is over.

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:03.229
And so, what do you do?

00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:06.431
You go on vacation. (Laughter)

00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:07.766
You come back from vacation.

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:13.216
Now you've got all of this test data from last year.

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:15.569
You don't look at it.

00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:17.832
Why would you look at it?

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:19.991
You're going to go and teach this year.

00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:23.243
So how much money did we just spend on all of that?

00:10:23.243 --> 00:10:26.246
Billions and billions of dollars

00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:29.303
for data that it's too late to use.

00:10:29.303 --> 00:10:31.129
I need that data in September.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:32.900
I need that data in November.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.908
I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know

00:10:34.908 --> 00:10:37.293
whether or not what I did corrected that.

00:10:37.293 --> 00:10:39.274
I need to know that this week.

00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:42.853
I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.

00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:48.043
Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.

00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:51.266
I can predict school scores.

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.311
You take me to any school.

00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:56.369
I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.

00:10:56.369 --> 00:11:00.184
And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids

00:11:00.184 --> 00:11:02.791
were on grade level.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:04.685
And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do

00:11:04.685 --> 00:11:05.634
from last year to this year?"

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:07.449
You say, "We're doing the same thing."

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:10.204
I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:13.370
This year, somewhere between 44

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.265
and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.

00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:19.840
And I will be right every single time.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.229
So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?

00:11:24.229 --> 00:11:26.821
Teachers need real information right now

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.410
about what's happening to their kids.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.803
The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.

00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:38.637
So here's the other issue that I just think

00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:41.445
we've got to be concerned about.

00:11:41.445 --> 00:11:45.725
We can't stifle innovation in our business.

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:49.618
We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.

00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:51.605
They get angry if you do something different.

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:53.382
If you try something new, people are always like,

00:11:53.382 --> 00:11:57.879
"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:00.240
This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.311
Let's try something different. And here's the rub.

00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:05.403
Some of it's not going to work.

00:12:05.403 --> 00:12:08.141
You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."

00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:11.609
A lot of them don't. They should be closed.

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:13.515
I mean, I really believe they should be closed.

00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:17.824
But we can't confuse figuring out the science

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:22.600
and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.502
Right? Because that's not the way the world works.

00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:26.008
If you think about technology,

00:12:26.008 --> 00:12:28.522
imagine if that's how we thought about technology.

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:29.819
Every time something didn't work,

00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:32.365
we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?

00:12:32.365 --> 00:12:35.534
You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --

00:12:35.534 --> 00:12:40.059
the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.538
They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot

00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:44.491
you'll never need another thing."

00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:48.932
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.691
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.

00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:58.608
Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.

00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:01.112
The folks went out there. They kept inventing.

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:04.222
The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:07.108
from pushing the science forward.

00:13:07.108 --> 00:13:09.280
Our job as educators,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.745
there's some stuff we know that we can do.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:15.724
And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:18.648
we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.

00:13:18.648 --> 00:13:21.056
We've got to give them all of these opportunities.

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:24.372
So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,

00:13:24.372 --> 00:13:28.164
this idea that we've got to keep innovating

00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:31.088
until we really nail this science down

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:33.296
is something that is absolutely critical.

00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:35.520
And this is something, by the way,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.055
that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.

00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:44.334
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.

00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:47.003
We have run out of time.

00:13:47.003 --> 00:13:50.091
I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff

00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:53.544
that we are walking over right this very second,

00:13:53.544 --> 00:13:57.984
and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness

00:13:57.984 --> 00:14:00.946
about saying we can't afford this â€”

00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:03.192
So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:05.752
What is five billion dollars to the United States?

00:14:05.752 --> 00:14:08.425
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?

00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:12.392
How many trillions? (Applause)

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:15.416
When the country cares about something,

00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:19.065
we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:22.009
When the safety of America is threatened,

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.880
we will spend any amount of money.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.936
The real safety of our nation

00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:30.313
is preparing this next generation

00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:32.552
so that they can take our place

00:14:32.552 --> 00:14:36.739
and be the leaders of the world

00:14:36.739 --> 00:14:39.936
when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy

00:14:39.936 --> 00:14:42.313
and all that stuff we care about.

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:46.858
I dare say it's a pittance,

00:14:46.858 --> 00:14:50.543
what it would require for us to really

00:14:50.543 --> 00:14:52.791
begin to solve some of these problems.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:58.180
So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:03.975
So, you guys, help me get there.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.304
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

00:15:06.304 --> 00:15:15.627
(Applause)

00:15:15.627 --> 00:15:19.835
John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.302
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,

00:15:21.302 --> 00:15:23.625
100 percent of our kids graduated high school

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:24.776
last year in my school.

00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:26.244
A hundred percent of them went to college.

00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:29.634
This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:32.696
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.

00:15:32.696 --> 00:15:35.310
We'd better get that other seven percent.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:42.005
So that's just how this goes. (Applause)

00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:44.598
JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?

00:15:44.598 --> 00:15:47.187
GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems

00:15:47.187 --> 00:15:49.629
we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:51.558
these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,

00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:52.900
they drop out in record numbers.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.565
And so we've figured out that you've got to really design

00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:59.989
a network of support for these kids that in many ways

00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:02.454
mimics what a good parent does.

00:16:02.454 --> 00:16:05.551
They harass you, right? They call you, they say,

00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:07.662
"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?

00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:10.625
What are you talking about that you want to leave school?

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:11.915
And you're not coming back here."

00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:14.170
So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.501
because Geoff is looking for you.

00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:18.804
They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.

00:16:18.804 --> 00:16:21.630
But I'm not kidding about some of this,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.426
and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:27.620
When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.524
it puts a different pressure on them,

00:16:29.524 --> 00:16:31.212
and they don't give up as easy.

00:16:31.212 --> 00:16:33.654
So sometimes they don't have it inside,

00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:35.700
and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.053
but I know my mother's going to be mad."

00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:41.782
Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.

00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:45.591
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring

00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:49.526
and help and support, but also a set of encouragements

00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:52.136
that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.194
but we refuse to let you fail."

00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:55.774
JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.

00:16:55.774 --> 00:16:57.438
Please give it up for him one more time.

00:16:57.438 --> 00:17:02.439
(Applause)
