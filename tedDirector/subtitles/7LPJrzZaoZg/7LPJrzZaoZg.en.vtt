00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.556
I've got a confession.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.138
I love looking through people's garbage.

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:19.717
Now, it's not some creepy thing.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:21.907
I'm usually just looking
for old electronics,

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:24.357
stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.020
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.653
Each one's got three different motors,

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:32.614
so now you can build things that move.

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:35.353
There's switches so you can
turn things on and off.

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:37.235
There's even a freaking laser,

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:42.035
so you can make a cool robot
into an awesome robot.

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:45.944
Now, I've built
a lot of stuff out of garbage,

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:48.749
and some of these things
have even been kind of useful.

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:49.958
But here's the thing,

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:52.583
for me, garbage is just a chance to play,

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:55.530
to be creative and build things
to amuse myself.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:59.190
This is what I love doing,
so I just made it part of my day job.

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:01.771
I lead a university-based
biological research lab,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.732
where we value curiosity
and exploration above all else.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:08.352
We aren't focused
on any particular problem,

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:10.938
and we're not trying to solve
any particular disease.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.646
This is just a place where people can come

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.446
and ask fascinating questions
and find answers.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.335
And I realized a long time ago

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.601
that if I challenge people
to build the equipment they need

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.738
out of the garbage I find,

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:27.525
it's a great way to foster creativity.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.700
And what happened

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:31.605
was that artists and scientists
from around the world

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:33.645
started coming to my lab.

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:36.878
And it's not just because
we value unconventional ideas,

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:39.220
it's because we test and validate them

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:40.671
with scientific rigor.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.521
So one day I was hacking something,
I was taking it apart,

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.402
and I had this sudden idea:

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.865
Could I treat biology like hardware?

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.140
Could I dismantle a biological system,

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:54.587
mix and match the parts

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.565
and then put it back together
in some new and creative way?

00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:00.030
My lab started working on this,

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:01.947
and I want to show you the result.

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.291
Can any of you guys
tell me what fruit this is?

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:08.429
Audience: Apple!

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.610
Andrew Pelling:
That's right -- it's an apple.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:12.643
Now, I actually want you to notice as well

00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:15.461
that this is a lot redder
than most apples.

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:19.020
And that's because
we grew human cells into it.

00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:23.222
We took a totally innocent
Macintosh apple,

00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:26.265
removed all the apple cells and DNA

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.308
and then implanted human cells.

00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:31.381
And what we're left with
after removing all the apple cells

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:33.146
is this cellulose scaffold.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.307
This is the stuff that gives plants
their shape and texture.

00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.303
And these little holes that you can see,

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:40.728
this is where all
the apple cells used to be.

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:42.438
So then we come along,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.524
we implant some mammalian cells
that you can see in blue.

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:47.756
What happens is,
these guys start multiplying

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.774
and they fill up this entire scaffold.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:52.222
As weird as this is,

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:56.931
it's actually really reminiscent
of how our own tissues are organized.

00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.208
And we found in our pre-clinical work

00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:01.628
that you can implant
these scaffolds into the body,

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:04.335
and the body will send in cells
and a blood supply

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.574
and actually keep these things alive.

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:10.445
This is the point
when people started asking me,

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.016
"Andrew, can you make
body parts out of apples?"

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:18.025
And I'm like, "You've come
to the right place."

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.326
(Laughter)

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:21.900
I actually brought this up with my wife.

00:03:21.924 --> 00:03:23.658
She's a musical instrument maker,

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.995
and she does a lot
of wood carving for a living.

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.260
So I asked her,

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:32.102
"Could you, like,
literally carve some ears

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:33.658
out of an apple for us?"

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.133
And she did.

00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:37.929
So I took her ears to the lab.

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:39.706
We then started preparing them.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.316
Yeah, I know.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.373
(Laughter)

00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:47.115
It's a good lab, man.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.600
(Laughter)

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.331
And then we grew cells on them.

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:52.393
And this is the result.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:58.349
Listen, my lab is not
in the ear-manufacturing business.

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:03.114
People have actually been working
on this for decades.

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:04.786
Here's the issue:

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.216
commercial scaffolds can be
really expensive and problematic,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.841
because they're sourced
from proprietary products,

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:13.968
animals or cadavers.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.135
We used an apple and it cost pennies.

00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:24.910
What's also really cool here

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:27.079
is it's not that hard
to make these things.

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:30.035
The equipment you need
can be built from garbage,

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.242
and the key processing step
only requires soap and water.

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:38.708
So what we did was put all
the instructions online as open source.

00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:41.529
And then we founded
a mission-driven company,

00:04:41.553 --> 00:04:43.931
and we're developing kits
to make it easier

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:46.526
for anyone with a sink
and a soldering iron

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.108
to make these things at home.

00:04:48.132 --> 00:04:52.205
What I'm really curious
about is if one day,

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.480
it will be possible to repair, rebuild
and augment our own bodies

00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:59.500
with stuff we make in the kitchen.

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:03.418
Speaking of kitchens,

00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:05.378
here's some asparagus.

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:08.085
They're tasty, and they make
your pee smell funny.

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:09.362
(Laughter)

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:12.009
Now, I was in my kitchen,
and I was noticing

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:14.619
that when you look down
the stalks of these asparagus,

00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:17.634
what you can see
are all these tiny little vessels.

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:19.307
And when we image them in the lab,

00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:22.320
you can see how the cellulose
forms these structures.

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:25.105
This image reminds me of two things:

00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.583
our blood vessels

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:31.355
and the structure and organization
of our nerves and spinal cord.

00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:33.151
So here's the question:

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.040
Can we grow axons and neurons
down these channels?

00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:39.690
Because if we can,

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:43.981
then maybe we can use asparagus
to form new connections

00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:46.862
between the ends of damaged
and severed nerves.

00:05:47.627 --> 00:05:49.430
Or maybe even a spinal cord.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:51.412
Don't get me wrong --

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:53.440
this is exceptionally challenging

00:05:53.464 --> 00:05:55.059
and really hard work to do,

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:57.701
and we are not the only ones
working on this.

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:01.056
But we are the only ones using asparagus.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.587
(Laughter)

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.178
Right now, we've got
really promising pilot data.

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:09.085
And we're working with tissue engineers

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:10.275
and neurosurgeons

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:12.195
to find out what's actually possible.

00:06:12.793 --> 00:06:15.347
So listen, all of the work I've shown you,

00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:18.564
the stuff that I've built
that's all around me on this stage

00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:21.258
and the other projects
my lab is involved in

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:25.369
are all a direct result
of me playing with your garbage.

00:06:25.393 --> 00:06:31.430
Play -- play is a key part
of my scientific practice.

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:35.438
It's how I train my mind
to be unconventional and to be creative

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.467
and to decide to make human apple ears.

00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:43.142
So, the next time any of you
are looking at some old,

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:47.745
broken-down, malfunctioning,
piece-of-crap technology,

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:49.366
I want you to think of me.

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.357
Because I want it.

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.532
(Laughter)

00:06:52.556 --> 00:06:56.563
Seriously, please find any way
to get in touch with me,

00:06:56.587 --> 00:06:58.528
and let's see what we can build.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:06:59.703
Thank you.

00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:04.270
(Applause)
