00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.747
America's public energy conversation

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:19.970
boils down to this question:

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.350
Would you rather die of A) oil wars,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.960
or B) climate change,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.360
or C) nuclear holocaust,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.660
or D) all of the above?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.460
Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.575
That's the one we're not normally offered.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:37.714
What if we could make energy do our work

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:40.160
without working our undoing?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.260
Could we have fuel without fear?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.668
Could we reinvent fire?

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:46.298
You see, fire made us human;

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.352
fossil fuels made us modern.

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:49.652
But now we need a new fire

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:53.175
that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:55.434
Let's see how.

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.320
Four-fifths of the world's energy

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.093
still comes from burning each year

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.593
four cubic miles of the rotted remains

00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:06.193
of primeval swamp goo.

00:01:06.193 --> 00:01:08.327
Those fossil fuels

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:11.404
have built our civilization.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.473
They've created our wealth.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:15.065
They've enriched the lives of billions.

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.704
But they also have rising costs

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:22.093
to our security, economy, health and environment

00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:25.347
that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.

00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:27.589
So we need a new fire.

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.491
And switching from the old fire to the new fire

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.527
means changing two big stories about oil and electricity,

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:39.204
each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:41.173
But they're really quite distinct.

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:44.585
Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil --

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:48.289
although almost half is made from coal.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.568
Their uses are quite concentrated.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:53.308
Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:56.083
Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.124
And the rest of both runs factories.

00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.960
So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.729
save oil and coal,

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.160
and also natural gas that can displace both of them.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.845
But today's energy system is not just inefficient,

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:12.852
it is also disconnected,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:15.560
aging, dirty and insecure.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.037
So it needs refurbishment.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.465
By 2050 though, it could become efficient,

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:24.727
connected and distributed

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.127
with elegantly frugal

00:02:26.127 --> 00:02:28.860
autos, factories and buildings

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.227
all relying on a modern, secure

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:33.889
and resilient electricity system.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:39.327
We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:42.496
and use one-third less natural gas

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.381
while switching to efficient use

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.965
and renewable supply.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:51.498
This could cost, by 2050,

00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:54.750
five trillion dollars less in net present value,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.393
that is expressed as a lump sum today,

00:02:57.393 --> 00:02:58.939
than business as usual --

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.393
assuming that carbon emissions

00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:03.458
and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero --

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:07.342
a conservatively low estimate.

00:03:07.342 --> 00:03:09.293
Yet this cheaper energy system

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:13.127
could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:15.496
all without needing oil or coal,

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:17.960
or for that matter nuclear energy.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.983
Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:24.245
and no acts of Congress

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:28.727
and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:31.678
and running Washington gridlock.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:32.593
Let me say that again.

00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:35.362
I'm going to tell you how to get the United States

00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:38.673
completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:40.019
with no act of Congress

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.529
led by business for profit.

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.168
In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions --

00:03:46.168 --> 00:03:49.981
private enterprise co-evolving with civil society

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.493
and sped by military innovation

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:55.293
to go around our least effective institutions.

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:57.627
And whether you care most

00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:01.058
about profits and jobs and competitive advantage

00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.468
or national security, or environmental stewardship

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:05.629
and climate protection and public health,

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.912
reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.

00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:13.358
General Eisenhower reputedly said

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:15.978
that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem

00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:20.547
makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.

00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:22.216
So in reinventing fire,

00:04:22.216 --> 00:04:25.383
we integrated all four sectors that use energy --

00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:29.022
transportation, buildings, industry and electricity --

00:04:29.022 --> 00:04:31.645
and we integrated four kinds of innovation,

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:34.193
not just technology and policy,

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:37.293
but also design and business strategy.

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:39.308
Those combinations yield

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:41.414
very much more than the sum of the parts,

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:46.760
especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.808
Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,

00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:53.175
plus another four billion dollars a day

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:55.822
in hidden economic and military costs,

00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:59.752
raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:02.296
Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.

00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:04.942
So let's start by making autos oil free.

00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:08.122
Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car

00:05:08.122 --> 00:05:10.324
is caused by its weight.

00:05:10.324 --> 00:05:13.831
And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,

00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:15.078
by taking out weight or drag,

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.108
saves seven units in the tank,

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.793
because you don't have to waste six units

00:05:18.793 --> 00:05:20.893
getting the energy to the wheels.

00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:24.478
Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:27.193
epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:31.016
gain weight twice as fast as we have.

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:34.670
But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.239
like carbon fiber composites,

00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:39.627
can make dramatic weight savings snowball

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:43.542
and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.908
Lighter and more slippery autos

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.155
need less force to move them,

00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:50.429
so their engines get smaller.

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:53.260
Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.427
then makes electric propulsion affordable

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:59.560
because the batteries or fuel cells

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.160
also get smaller and lighter and cheaper.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.060
So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.581
while the driving cost, even from the start,

00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.329
is very much lower.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:16.475
So these innovations together can transform automakers

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:18.837
from wringing tiny savings

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:22.168
out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies

00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:24.906
to the steeply falling costs

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:30.006
of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other --

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.929
namely ultralight materials, making them into structures

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:36.260
and electric propulsion.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.960
The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.668
with temporary feebates,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.922
that is rebates for efficient new autos

00:06:44.922 --> 00:06:48.022
paid for by fees on inefficient ones.

00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:50.868
And just in the first two years

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:54.316
the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:58.362
has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.

00:06:58.362 --> 00:07:01.791
The resulting shift to electric autos

00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.262
is going to be as game-changing

00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:07.460
as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.560
Of course, computers and electronics

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.860
are now America's biggest industry,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.014
while typewriter makers have vanished.

00:07:14.014 --> 00:07:15.935
So vehicle fitness

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:19.504
opens a new automotive competitive strategy

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:22.758
that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:25.635
but then also make electrification affordable,

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:29.619
and that displaces the rest of the oil.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:33.175
America could lead this next automotive revolution.

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:35.660
Currently the leader is Germany.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.168
Last year, Volkswagen announced

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:40.391
that by next year they'll be producing

00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.260
this carbon fiber plugin hybrid

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.668
getting 230 miles a gallon.

00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.183
Also last year, BMW announced

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:50.452
this carbon fiber electric car,

00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:52.427
they said that its carbon fiber is paid for

00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:54.481
by needing fewer batteries.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:57.012
And they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."

00:07:57.027 --> 00:08:00.535
Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.

00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:03.760
Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.352
American manufacturing technology

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:13.796
was used to make this little carbon fiber test part,

00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:16.135
which doubles as a carbon cap.

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:17.698
(Laughter)

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:20.760
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.593
how immensely stiff and strong it is.

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:27.085
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.

00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:29.308
Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.847
without even scuffing it.

00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:32.962
But such manufacturing techniques

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.185
can scale to automotive speed and cost

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:37.639
with aerospace performance.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:41.160
They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.322
They can save lives

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:43.614
because this stuff can absorb

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:46.878
up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:48.627
If we made all of our autos this way,

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:51.550
it would save oil equivalent to finding

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.382
one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,

00:08:54.382 --> 00:08:58.814
by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.

00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:01.514
And all those mega-barrels under Detroit

00:09:01.514 --> 00:09:04.027
cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:05.873
They are all-American, carbon-free

00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:08.193
and inexhaustible.

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:10.947
The same physics and the same business logic

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.493
also apply to big vehicles.

00:09:12.493 --> 00:09:15.185
In the five years ending with 2010,

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:19.760
Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.160
in its giant fleet of heavy trucks

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.560
through better logistics and design.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.575
But just the technological savings in heavy trucks

00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:27.460
can get to two-thirds.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.747
And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,

00:09:30.747 --> 00:09:32.468
now on the drawing board,

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:34.714
can save close to a trillion dollars.

00:09:34.714 --> 00:09:39.083
Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:42.060
is going to speed up all of these civilian advances

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.589
in much the same way that military R&amp;D

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:47.783
has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System

00:09:47.783 --> 00:09:50.852
and the jet engine and microchip industries.

00:09:50.852 --> 00:09:54.375
As we design and build vehicles better,

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:56.475
we can also use them smarter

00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:58.722
by harnessing four powerful techniques

00:09:58.722 --> 00:10:00.714
for eliminating needless driving.

00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:03.506
Instead of just seeing the travel grow,

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:06.160
we can use innovative pricing,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.114
charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.

00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:13.360
We can use some smart IT to enhance transit

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.901
and enable car sharing and ride sharing.

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:21.160
We can allow smart and lucrative growth models

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.337
that help people already be near where they want to be,

00:10:25.337 --> 00:10:26.850
so they don't need to go somewhere else.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.960
And we can use smart IT

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.496
to make traffic free-flowing.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:34.327
Together, those things can give us the same or better access

00:10:34.327 --> 00:10:38.827
with 46 to 84 percent less driving,

00:10:38.827 --> 00:10:41.465
saving another 0.4 trillion dollars,

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:46.460
plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.165
So 40 years hence, when you add it all up,

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:52.173
a far more mobile U.S. economy

00:10:52.173 --> 00:10:54.252
can use no oil.

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:57.760
Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.160
rather than buying them for over a hundred,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.935
adds up to a $4 trillion net saving

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:05.942
counting all the hidden costs at zero.

00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:08.860
So to get mobility without oil,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.960
to phase out the oil,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.391
we can get efficient and then switch fuels.

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:18.735
Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:22.578
can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,

00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:25.689
electricity and advanced biofuels.

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:29.342
The trucks and planes can realistically use

00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:32.162
hydrogen or advanced biofuels.

00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:34.227
The trucks could even use natural gas.

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:36.227
But no vehicles will need oil.

00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:39.312
And the most biofuel we might need,

00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:41.055
just three million barrels a day,

00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:42.693
can be made two-thirds from waste

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.527
without displacing any cropland

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:47.560
and without harming soil or climate.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.575
Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:52.527
by what we call "institutional acupuncture."

00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:53.927
We figure out where the business logic

00:11:53.927 --> 00:11:56.396
is congested and not flowing properly,

00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:58.208
we stick little needles in it to get it flowing,

00:11:58.208 --> 00:12:00.701
working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.162
And the long transition is already well under way.

00:12:04.162 --> 00:12:08.465
In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:11.412
not in supply, but in demand.

00:12:11.412 --> 00:12:16.524
And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.

00:12:16.524 --> 00:12:21.185
In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:25.278
before it becomes unavailable even at high prices.

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:28.204
But the electrified vehicles

00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.981
don't need to burden the electricity grid.

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:34.416
Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:36.842
through smart buildings with smart grids,

00:12:36.842 --> 00:12:40.158
they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage

00:12:40.158 --> 00:12:42.008
that help the grid integrate

00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:44.855
varying solar and wind power.

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:46.531
So the electrified autos

00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:49.155
make the auto and electricity problems

00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:51.393
easier to solve together than separately.

00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:53.224
And they also converge the oil story

00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:55.808
with our second big story,

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:59.568
saving electricity and then making it differently.

00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:02.550
And those twin revolutions in electricity

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.604
will bring to that sector

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:08.389
more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:09.750
than any other sector,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.965
because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on

00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:18.660
with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.735
Changing how we make electricity gets easier

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:24.250
if we need less of it.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.912
Most of it now is wasted

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:27.893
and the technologies for saving it

00:13:27.893 --> 00:13:30.847
keep improving faster than we're installing them.

00:13:30.847 --> 00:13:33.293
So the unbought efficiency resource

00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:36.193
keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.

00:13:36.193 --> 00:13:39.255
But as efficiency in buildings and industry

00:13:39.255 --> 00:13:41.227
starts to grow faster than the economy,

00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:45.650
America's electricity use could actually shrink,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.247
even with the little extra use required

00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:51.227
for those efficient electrified autos.

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:56.055
And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.

00:13:56.055 --> 00:13:58.393
Over the next 40 years, buildings,

00:13:58.393 --> 00:14:00.601
which use three-quarters of the electricity,

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:04.435
can triple or quadruple their energy productivity,

00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:08.360
saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.960
with a 33 percent internal rate of return

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.631
or in English,

00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.827
the savings are worth four times what they cost.

00:14:16.827 --> 00:14:19.065
And industry can accelerate too,

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.781
doubling its energy productivity

00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:23.729
with a 21 percent internal rate of return.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.768
The key is a disruptive innovation

00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:28.591
that we call integrative design

00:14:28.591 --> 00:14:31.519
that often makes very big energy savings

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:33.996
cost less than small or no savings.

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:36.624
That is, it can give you expanding returns,

00:14:36.624 --> 00:14:38.478
not diminishing returns.

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:42.224
That is how our 2010 retrofit

00:14:42.224 --> 00:14:45.427
is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building --

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:49.581
remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:53.893
into super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:57.078
plus better lights and office equipment and such

00:14:57.078 --> 00:15:00.693
cut the maximum cooling load by a third.

00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:05.760
And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.283
saved 17 million dollars of

00:15:07.283 --> 00:15:10.660
capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.704
and reduce the payback to just three years.

00:15:14.704 --> 00:15:16.927
Integrative design can also increase

00:15:16.927 --> 00:15:19.135
energy savings in industry.

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.127
Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment

00:15:21.127 --> 00:15:24.427
has already returned nine billion dollars.

00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:27.373
But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:29.568
of energy still to save.

00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:34.127
For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.

00:15:34.127 --> 00:15:36.196
Half of that runs pumps and fans.

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:39.070
And those can all be made more efficient,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.785
and the motors that turn them

00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:44.435
can have their system efficiency roughly doubled

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:48.350
by integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.578
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings

00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:54.227
that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.

00:15:54.227 --> 00:15:57.381
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,

00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:59.198
move liquid through pipes.

00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:00.998
But a standard industrial pumping loop

00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:05.375
was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.314
not by getting better pumps,

00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:10.696
but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes

00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:13.312
with fat, short, straight pipes.

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:16.527
This is not about new technology,

00:16:16.527 --> 00:16:18.504
it's just rearranging our metal furniture.

00:16:18.504 --> 00:16:20.858
Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment

00:16:20.858 --> 00:16:22.573
and its capital costs.

00:16:22.573 --> 00:16:25.193
So what do such savings mean

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.875
for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:31.975
Well, from the coal burned at the power plant

00:16:31.975 --> 00:16:35.096
through all these compounding losses,

00:16:35.096 --> 00:16:37.919
only a tenth of the fuel energy

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:40.919
actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:44.593
But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,

00:16:44.593 --> 00:16:50.224
and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe

00:16:50.224 --> 00:16:54.368
saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:56.975
and what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"

00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:58.393
back at the power plant.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.085
And of course, as you go back upstream,

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.385
the components get smaller and therefore cheaper.

00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:07.965
Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings

00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:11.198
in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns --

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.927
everything from data centers and chip fabs

00:17:13.927 --> 00:17:16.119
to mines and refineries.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.560
Typically our retrofit designs

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.514
save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy

00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:22.460
and pay back in a few years,

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.614
while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.060
with generally lower capital cost.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.124
Now needing less electricity

00:17:32.124 --> 00:17:34.439
would ease and speed

00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:37.601
the shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.

00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:42.085
China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.

00:17:42.085 --> 00:17:45.506
In fact, these solar power module costs

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.885
have just fallen off the bottom of the chart.

00:17:47.885 --> 00:17:50.955
And Germany now has more solar workers

00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:53.593
than America has steel workers.

00:17:53.593 --> 00:17:55.439
Already in about 20 states

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:57.793
private installers will come

00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:01.278
put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down

00:18:01.278 --> 00:18:03.147
and beat your utility bill.

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:05.339
Such unregulated products

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:08.193
could ultimately add up to a virtual utility

00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:11.147
that bypasses your electric company

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:14.978
just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.

00:18:14.978 --> 00:18:18.396
And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees

00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:20.619
and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:23.712
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.

00:18:23.712 --> 00:18:26.189
For each of the past four years

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:29.027
half of the world's new generating capacity

00:18:29.027 --> 00:18:30.624
has been renewable,

00:18:30.624 --> 00:18:32.316
mainly lately in developing countries.

00:18:32.316 --> 00:18:36.608
In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,

00:18:36.608 --> 00:18:38.939
particularly wind and solar cells,

00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:43.931
got 151 billion dollars of private investment,

00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:46.516
and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity

00:18:46.516 --> 00:18:48.201
of nuclear power in the world

00:18:48.201 --> 00:18:51.660
by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.360
That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.175
that the world can now make every year --

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:01.522
a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.

00:19:01.522 --> 00:19:07.055
In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity

00:19:07.055 --> 00:19:10.624
and the orders behind those keep fading

00:19:10.624 --> 00:19:13.160
because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.560
In fact in this country,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.675
no new nuclear power plant

00:19:16.675 --> 00:19:19.193
has been able to raise any private construction capital,

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:23.608
despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.

00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:27.612
So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?

00:19:27.612 --> 00:19:31.381
Well efficiency and gas can displace them all

00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:34.065
at just below their operating cost

00:19:34.065 --> 00:19:37.819
and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times

00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:39.893
at less than their replacement cost.

00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:41.901
But we only need to replace them once.

00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:44.589
We're often told though

00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:46.970
that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.255
because they're 24/7,

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:51.078
whereas wind and solar power are variable,

00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:54.093
and hence supposedly unreliable.

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:57.478
Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.

00:19:57.478 --> 00:19:59.593
And when a big plant goes down,

00:19:59.593 --> 00:20:02.385
you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,

00:20:02.385 --> 00:20:05.878
often for weeks or months, often without warning.

00:20:05.878 --> 00:20:07.875
That is exactly why we've designed the grid

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:12.145
to back up failed plants with working plants.

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.875
And in exactly the same way,

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:18.906
the grid can handle wind and solar power's

00:20:18.906 --> 00:20:21.455
forecastable variations.

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:24.762
Hourly simulations

00:20:24.762 --> 00:20:28.529
show that largely or wholly renewable grids

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:30.306
can deliver highly reliable power

00:20:30.306 --> 00:20:31.935
when they're forecasted,

00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:33.989
integrated and diversified

00:20:33.989 --> 00:20:36.042
by both type and location.

00:20:36.042 --> 00:20:40.265
And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe

00:20:40.265 --> 00:20:44.750
and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.389
That is how, for example,

00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:48.773
four German states in 2010

00:20:48.773 --> 00:20:51.370
were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:55.027
Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,

00:20:55.027 --> 00:20:57.352
Denmark 36.

00:20:57.352 --> 00:21:00.637
And it's how all of Europe can shift

00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:01.922
to renewable electricity.

00:21:01.922 --> 00:21:06.647
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system

00:21:06.647 --> 00:21:09.531
has to be replaced anyway by 2050.

00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:11.158
And whatever we replace it with

00:21:11.158 --> 00:21:12.596
is going to cost about the same,

00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:15.306
about six trillion dollars at present value --

00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:17.514
whether we buy more of what we've got

00:21:17.514 --> 00:21:19.627
or new nuclear and so-called clean coal,

00:21:19.627 --> 00:21:23.258
or renewables that are more or less centralized.

00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:26.527
But those four futures at the same cost

00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:28.596
differ profoundly in their risks,

00:21:28.596 --> 00:21:31.127
around national security,

00:21:31.127 --> 00:21:34.665
fuel, water, finance, technology,

00:21:34.665 --> 00:21:36.196
climate and health.

00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:39.031
For example, our over-centralized grid

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:42.962
is very vulnerable to cascading

00:21:42.962 --> 00:21:45.689
and potentially economy-shattering blackouts

00:21:45.689 --> 00:21:49.127
caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters

00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:51.073
or a terrorist attack.

00:21:51.073 --> 00:21:53.804
But that blackout risk disappears,

00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:55.781
and all of the other risks are best managed,

00:21:55.796 --> 00:21:58.050
with distributed renewables

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.327
organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,

00:22:02.327 --> 00:22:04.135
but can stand alone at need.

00:22:04.135 --> 00:22:06.173
That is, they can disconnect fractally

00:22:06.173 --> 00:22:09.027
and then reconnect seamlessly.

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:12.304
That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting

00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:13.619
for its own power supply.

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:16.885
They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?

00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:18.570
We want our stuff to work too.

00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:22.155
At about the same cost as business as usual,

00:22:22.155 --> 00:22:24.160
this would maximize national security,

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.162
customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity

00:22:28.162 --> 00:22:29.785
and innovation.

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:35.460
Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.383
are starting to transform the whole electricity sector.

00:22:38.383 --> 00:22:40.014
Traditionally utilities build

00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:42.183
a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants

00:22:42.183 --> 00:22:44.129
and a bunch of big gas plants

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.198
and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.727
And those utilities were rewarded,

00:22:47.727 --> 00:22:50.181
as they still are in 34 states,

00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:53.647
for selling you more electricity.

00:22:53.647 --> 00:22:56.445
However, especially where regulators

00:22:56.445 --> 00:22:59.998
are now instead rewarding cutting your bills,

00:22:59.998 --> 00:23:03.781
the investments are shifting radically

00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.312
toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,

00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:09.681
renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:11.104
with less transmission

00:23:11.104 --> 00:23:13.958
and little or no bulk electricity storage.

00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.785
So our energy future is not fate, but choice,

00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:19.531
and that choice is very flexible.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.131
In 1976, for example,

00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:22.939
government and industry insisted

00:23:22.955 --> 00:23:25.539
that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:27.322
could never go down.

00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:30.952
And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.

00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:33.201
Well that's what's actually happened so far.

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:34.531
It's fallen by half.

00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:37.022
But with today's much better technologies,

00:23:37.022 --> 00:23:39.931
more mature delivery channels and integrative design,

00:23:39.931 --> 00:23:43.831
we can do far more and even cheaper.

00:23:43.831 --> 00:23:46.339
So to solve the energy problem,

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:48.260
we just needed to enlarge it.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.460
And the results may at first seem incredible,

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.237
but as Marshall McLuhan said,

00:23:53.237 --> 00:23:55.989
"Only puny secrets need protection.

00:23:55.989 --> 00:24:02.073
Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:05.555
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:07.239
both driven by modern efficiency,

00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:10.781
and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,

00:24:10.781 --> 00:24:15.912
where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets

00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:20.442
can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,

00:24:20.442 --> 00:24:22.762
saving 5 trillion dollars,

00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:25.355
growing the economy 2.6-fold,

00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:26.998
strengthening out national security,

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:29.983
oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,

00:24:29.983 --> 00:24:34.493
reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.

00:24:34.493 --> 00:24:37.827
Now if you like any of those outcomes,

00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:40.019
you can support reinventing fire

00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:41.881
without needing to like all of them

00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:45.304
and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.

00:24:45.304 --> 00:24:48.381
So focusing on outcomes, not motives,

00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:50.937
can turn gridlock and conflict

00:24:50.937 --> 00:24:55.239
into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.

00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:58.296
This also turns out to be the best way

00:24:58.296 --> 00:25:00.796
to cope with global challenges --

00:25:00.796 --> 00:25:03.375
climate change, nuclear proliferation,

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:05.806
energy insecurity, energy poverty --

00:25:05.806 --> 00:25:09.452
all of which make us less safe.

00:25:09.452 --> 00:25:13.139
Now our team at RMI helps smart companies

00:25:13.139 --> 00:25:16.208
to get unstuck and speed this journey

00:25:16.208 --> 00:25:19.270
via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.227
Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.

00:25:22.227 --> 00:25:25.404
Former oil man Maurice Strong said,

00:25:25.404 --> 00:25:27.350
"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.655
But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,

00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:35.801
"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem

00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:41.381
because," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."

00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:44.245
I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization

00:25:44.245 --> 00:25:45.852
business opportunity,

00:25:45.852 --> 00:25:48.275
but one of the most profound transitions

00:25:48.275 --> 00:25:50.791
in the history of our species.

00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:54.214
We humans are inventing a new fire,

00:25:54.214 --> 00:25:55.958
not dug from below,

00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:58.865
but flowing from above;

00:25:58.865 --> 00:26:01.796
not scarce, but bountiful;

00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:03.496
not local, but everywhere;

00:26:03.496 --> 00:26:06.127
not transient, but permanent;

00:26:06.127 --> 00:26:09.027
not costly, but free.

00:26:09.027 --> 00:26:12.427
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas

00:26:12.427 --> 00:26:15.989
and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,

00:26:15.989 --> 00:26:19.698
this new fire is flameless.

00:26:19.698 --> 00:26:23.762
Efficiently used, it really can do our work

00:26:23.762 --> 00:26:26.616
without working our undoing.

00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:31.498
Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.

00:26:31.498 --> 00:26:33.752
And our new book "Reinventing Fire"

00:26:33.752 --> 00:26:36.137
describes how you can capture it.

00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:38.406
So with the conversation just begun

00:26:38.406 --> 00:26:40.291
at ReinventingFire.com,

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:42.422
let me invite you each

00:26:42.422 --> 00:26:46.260
to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.052
to help make the world richer, fairer,

00:26:49.052 --> 00:26:51.660
cooler and safer

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.468
by together reinventing fire.

00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:56.327
Thank you.

00:26:56.327 --> 00:26:57.727
(Applause)
