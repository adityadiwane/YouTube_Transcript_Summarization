00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:19.229
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:22.927
which has an equally disturbing answer.

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:26.529
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.863
and the question I'm going to tackle

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:32.944
is the one question everyone always asks:

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:34.556
Why does she stay?

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:38.552
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?

00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:41.529
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:43.864
or an expert in domestic violence.

00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:47.063
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:51.576
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:54.048
I had moved to New York City for my first job

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.344
as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.

00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:59.584
I had my first apartment,

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:02.784
my first little green American Express card,

00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:05.812
and I had a very big secret.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:09.511
My secret was that I had this gun

00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.949
loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:15.512
by the man who I thought was my soulmate,

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:18.997
many, many times.

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:22.557
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:26.636
held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.821
more times than I can even remember.

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:32.564
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,

00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:35.748
a psychological trap disguised as love,

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:38.600
one that millions of women and even a few men

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.981
fall into every year.

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.730
It may even be your story.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.773
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.079
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.441
an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.733
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:59.005
including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.801
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:05.590
and we have three kids together.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.819
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.299
(Laughter)

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.018
So my first message for you is that domestic violence

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:17.386
happens to everyone --

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:21.562
all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:23.501
It's everywhere.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.021
And my second message is that everyone thinks

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.139
domestic violence happens to women,

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.407
that it's a women's issue.

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:32.626
Not exactly.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:36.738
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:42.656
happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:44.825
in other words, in families,

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:48.690
the last place we would want or expect to find violence,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.968
which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:56.519
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.091
who would stay with a man who beats me,

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:02.498
but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.

00:03:02.498 --> 00:03:05.783
I was 22, and in the United States,

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:09.632
women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely

00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:12.393
to be domestic violence victims

00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:15.208
as women of other ages,

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:18.511
and over 500 women and girls this age

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:22.082
are killed every year by abusive partners,

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:26.715
boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:29.775
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:34.360
about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.425
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.388
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.527
and he started chatting me up.

00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:46.395
He told me two things.

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:50.197
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:54.552
and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.

00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:58.212
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting

00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:01.500
was that he was smart and funny

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.900
and he looked like a farm boy.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.247
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:06.932
and this wheat-blond hair,

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:10.219
and he seemed so sweet.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.003
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:19.577
was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:21.778
He did this especially at the beginning

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:24.644
by idolizing me.

00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:27.930
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.614
that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,

00:04:29.614 --> 00:04:32.644
that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:35.175
He wanted to know everything about my family

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:37.791
and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.

00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:41.425
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:45.104
in a way that no one else ever had.

00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:49.429
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:51.949
by confessing his secret,

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.429
which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.340
he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.026
by his stepfather,

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:04.966
and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:07.585
even though he was very smart,

00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:10.841
and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.

00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.997
Which is why that Ivy League degree

00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:16.810
and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.381
meant so much to him.

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.525
If you had told me

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:26.889
that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.272
would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,

00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:33.322
how short my skirts were,

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.252
where I lived, what jobs I took,

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:38.616
who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,

00:05:38.616 --> 00:05:40.564
I would have laughed at you,

00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:43.612
because there was not a hint of violence or control

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:47.096
or anger in Conor at the beginning.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:50.221
I didn't know that the first stage

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:52.596
in any domestic violence relationship

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:56.248
is to seduce and charm the victim.

00:05:56.248 --> 00:06:01.008
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.

00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:05.162
Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,

00:06:05.162 --> 00:06:08.296
"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:10.301
but I need to move into the next phase

00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:14.480
where I isolate you and I abuse you" — (Laughter) —

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.835
"so I need to get you out of this apartment

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:17.476
where the neighbors can hear you scream

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.949
and out of this city where you have friends and family

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.255
and coworkers who can see the bruises."

00:06:23.255 --> 00:06:27.476
Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:30.207
and he told me that he had quit his job that day,

00:06:30.207 --> 00:06:32.672
his dream job,

00:06:32.672 --> 00:06:36.813
and he said that he had quit his job because of me,

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.991
because I had made him feel so safe and loved

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:43.114
that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,

00:06:43.114 --> 00:06:45.629
and he just wanted to get out of the city

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:48.607
and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.729
and move to a tiny town in New England

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.302
where he could start his life over with me by his side.

00:06:55.302 --> 00:06:59.168
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.775
and my dream job,

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:05.358
but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:08.822
so I agreed, and I quit my job,

00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:11.453
and Conor and I left Manhattan together.

00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:15.819
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.451
that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid

00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:24.431
physical, financial and psychological trap.

00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:26.751
The next step in the domestic violence pattern

00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:31.033
is to introduce the threat of violence

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.232
and see how she reacts.

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:35.941
And here's where those guns come in.

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:38.859
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.597
that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --

00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:44.013
he bought three guns.

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:47.453
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:50.109
He kept one under the pillows on our bed,

00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:53.271
and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:55.589
And he said that he needed those guns

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:58.385
because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.

00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:00.869
He needed them to feel protected.

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:03.781
But those guns were really a message for me,

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:06.475
and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,

00:08:06.475 --> 00:08:12.281
my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.

00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:15.854
Conor first physically attacked me

00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:18.679
five days before our wedding.

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:22.871
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.

00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:27.111
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:28.925
and I got frustrated,

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.012
and Conor used my anger as an excuse

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:35.163
to put both of his hands around my neck

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:38.983
and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,

00:08:38.983 --> 00:08:40.807
and he used the chokehold

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:45.233
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:50.551
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,

00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:53.026
and I put on my mother's wedding dress,

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:55.343
and I married him.

00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:57.624
Despite what had happened,

00:08:57.624 --> 00:09:01.143
I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,

00:09:01.143 --> 00:09:05.224
because I loved him, and he loved me so much.

00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:08.596
And he was very, very sorry.

00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:11.769
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.966
and by becoming a family with me.

00:09:13.966 --> 00:09:15.687
It was an isolated incident,

00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:19.283
and he was never going to hurt me again.

00:09:19.283 --> 00:09:21.863
It happened twice more on the honeymoon.

00:09:21.863 --> 00:09:24.950
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.652
and I got lost,

00:09:27.652 --> 00:09:30.622
and he punched me in the side of my head so hard

00:09:30.622 --> 00:09:32.766
that the other side of my head repeatedly hit

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:35.173
the driver's side window.

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:38.539
And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:40.822
he got frustrated by traffic,

00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:44.254
and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.

00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:46.862
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week

00:09:46.862 --> 00:09:50.279
for the next two and a half years of our marriage.

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:53.404
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique

00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:56.047
and alone in this situation.

00:09:56.047 --> 00:09:58.238
One in three American women

00:09:58.238 --> 00:10:02.390
experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.031
and the CDC reports that 15 million children

00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.441
are abused every year, 15 million.

00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:13.814
So actually, I was in very good company.

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:16.230
Back to my question:

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.725
Why did I stay?

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:21.463
The answer is easy.

00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:24.151
I didn't know he was abusing me.

00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.999
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.222
pushed me down stairs,

00:10:30.222 --> 00:10:31.603
threatened to kill our dog,

00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:35.526
pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,

00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:38.043
poured coffee grinds on my head

00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:40.359
as I dressed for a job interview,

00:10:40.359 --> 00:10:44.729
I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.

00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:48.306
Instead, I was a very strong woman

00:10:48.306 --> 00:10:50.558
in love with a deeply troubled man,

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.615
and I was the only person on Earth

00:10:52.615 --> 00:10:56.055
who could help Conor face his demons.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.766
The other question everybody asks is,

00:10:59.766 --> 00:11:02.183
why doesn't she just leave?

00:11:02.183 --> 00:11:06.134
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.

00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:10.846
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:13.937
because we victims know something you usually don't:

00:11:13.937 --> 00:11:18.330
It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.649
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:24.544
is kill her.

00:11:24.544 --> 00:11:27.085
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:31.153
happen after the victim has ended the relationship,

00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:33.046
after she's gotten out,

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:36.297
because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:39.388
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,

00:11:39.388 --> 00:11:42.340
even after the abuser remarries;

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.495
denial of financial resources;

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.884
and manipulation of the family court system

00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:49.707
to terrify the victim and her children,

00:11:49.707 --> 00:11:54.633
who are regularly forced by family court judges

00:11:54.633 --> 00:11:56.602
to spend unsupervised time

00:11:56.602 --> 00:12:00.273
with the man who beat their mother.

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:04.448
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?

00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:06.202
I was able to leave,

00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:09.104
because of one final, sadistic beating

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:12.263
that broke through my denial.

00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:15.433
I realized that the man who I loved so much

00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:18.343
was going to kill me if I let him.

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:20.858
So I broke the silence.

00:12:20.858 --> 00:12:23.688
I told everyone:

00:12:23.688 --> 00:12:27.473
the police, my neighbors,

00:12:27.473 --> 00:12:31.313
my friends and family, total strangers,

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:38.167
and I'm here today because you all helped me.

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.705
We tend to stereotype victims

00:12:40.705 --> 00:12:43.767
as grisly headlines,

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:47.063
self-destructive women, damaged goods.

00:12:47.063 --> 00:12:50.066
The question, "Why does she stay?"

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:55.702
is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"

00:12:55.702 --> 00:12:59.026
as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men

00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:01.658
intent upon destroying us.

00:13:01.658 --> 00:13:04.162
But since publishing "Crazy Love,"

00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:07.685
I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.130
who also got out,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.510
who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.723
and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --

00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:21.057
as employees, wives and mothers,

00:13:21.057 --> 00:13:25.738
lives completely free of violence, like me.

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:29.769
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:33.213
and a typical domestic violence survivor.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:37.238
I remarried a kind and gentle man,

00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:39.574
and we have those three kids.

00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:42.975
I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.

00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:46.441
What I will never have again,

00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:49.399
ever,

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.524
is a loaded gun held to my head

00:13:51.524 --> 00:13:55.167
by someone who says that he loves me.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.798
Right now, maybe you're thinking,

00:13:57.798 --> 00:13:59.705
"Wow, this is fascinating,"

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.833
or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:08.836
but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.

00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:12.353
I promise you there are several people

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:14.095
listening to me right now

00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:17.107
who are currently being abused

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.622
or who were abused as children

00:14:19.622 --> 00:14:22.992
or who are abusers themselves.

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:24.929
Abuse could be affecting your daughter,

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:30.222
your sister, your best friend right now.

00:14:30.222 --> 00:14:33.666
I was able to end my own crazy love story

00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:35.867
by breaking the silence.

00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:38.382
I'm still breaking the silence today.

00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:42.198
It's my way of helping other victims,

00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:45.566
and it's my final request of you.

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:48.398
Talk about what you heard here.

00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:51.726
Abuse thrives only in silence.

00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:55.429
You have the power to end domestic violence

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:58.938
simply by shining a spotlight on it.

00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:02.012
We victims need everyone.

00:15:02.012 --> 00:15:06.085
We need every one of you to understand

00:15:06.085 --> 00:15:09.863
the secrets of domestic violence.

00:15:09.863 --> 00:15:12.847
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it

00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:14.974
with your children, your coworkers,

00:15:14.974 --> 00:15:16.911
your friends and family.

00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:20.357
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people

00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:23.172
with full futures.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:26.653
Recognize the early signs of violence

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:29.486
and conscientiously intervene,

00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:33.648
deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.

00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:37.643
Together we can make our beds,

00:15:37.643 --> 00:15:41.260
our dinner tables and our families

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.517
the safe and peaceful oases they should be.

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:46.489
Thank you.

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:54.197
(Applause)
