00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.848
I have spent my entire life

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:21.173
either at the schoolhouse,
on the way to the schoolhouse,

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:23.796
or talking about what happens
in the schoolhouse.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.919
(Laughter)

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:27.231
Both my parents were educators,

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.481
my maternal grandparents were educators,

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:33.600
and for the past 40 years,
I've done the same thing.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.688
And so, needless to say, over those years

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:40.204
I've had a chance
to look at education reform

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:42.035
from a lot of perspectives.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.989
Some of those reforms have been good.

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:46.258
Some of them have been not so good.

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.455
And we know why kids drop out.

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.934
We know why kids don't learn.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.851
It's either poverty, low attendance,

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.227
negative peer influences...

00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.864
We know why.

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:59.211
But one of the things
that we never discuss

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:01.523
or we rarely discuss

00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:05.815
is the value and importance
of human connection.

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:07.042
Relationships.

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:11.650
James Comer says
that no significant learning

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:14.123
can occur without
a significant relationship.

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:17.223
George Washington Carver says all learning

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:21.330
is understanding relationships.

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:25.874
Everyone in this room has been affected
by a teacher or an adult.

00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:31.492
For years, I have watched people teach.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.874
I have looked at the best
and I've looked at some of the worst.

00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:36.696
A colleague said to me one time,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.219
"They don't pay me to like the kids.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:40.808
They pay me to teach a lesson.

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:42.061
The kids should learn it.

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:43.991
I should teach it, they should learn it,

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:45.109
Case closed."

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.179
Well, I said to her,

00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:51.283
"You know, kids don't learn
from people they don't like."

00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:53.602
(Laughter)

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:59.196
(Applause)

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.601
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:03.648
And I said to her,

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:08.062
"Well, your year is going to be
long and arduous, dear."

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.553
Needless to say, it was.

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:13.339
Some people think that you can either
have it in you to build a relationship,

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:14.600
or you don't.

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.150
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:20.692
He said you ought to just
throw in a few simple things,

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:22.997
like seeking first to understand,

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:24.939
as opposed to being understood.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.342
Simple things, like apologizing.

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.700
You ever thought about that?

00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:31.880
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:33.068
(Laughter)

00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:35.497
I taught a lesson once on ratios.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.522
I'm not real good with math,
but I was working on it.

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:39.688
(Laughter)

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.494
And I got back and looked
at that teacher edition.

00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:44.322
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:45.650
(Laughter)

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:47.968
So I came back to class
the next day and I said,

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:50.200
"Look, guys, I need to apologize.

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:53.570
I taught the whole lesson wrong.
I'm so sorry."

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.899
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:57.919
You were so excited, we just let you go."

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.394
I have had classes that were so low,

00:03:07.418 --> 00:03:10.156
so academically deficient, that I cried.

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:13.783
I wondered, "How am I
going to take this group,

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:15.854
in nine months,

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:17.989
from where they are
to where they need to be?

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.108
And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.679
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:27.044
and his academic achievement
at the same time?

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:29.768
One year I came up with a bright idea.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.613
I told all my students,

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:35.254
"You were chosen to be in my class

00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:36.802
because I am the best teacher

00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:38.348
and you are the best students,

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:39.793
they put us all together

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:42.266
so we could show
everybody else how to do it."

00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:45.267
One of the students said, "Really?"

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.551
(Laughter)

00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:50.574
I said, "Really. We have
to show the other classes

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:53.034
how to do it, so when
we walk down the hall,

00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:55.585
people will notice us,
so you can't make noise.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.219
You just have to strut."

00:03:57.243 --> 00:03:58.436
(Laughter)

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.112
And I gave them a saying to say:

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.404
"I am somebody.

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:02.769
I was somebody when I came.

00:04:02.793 --> 00:04:04.693
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.

00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:06.686
I am powerful, and I am strong.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.376
I deserve the education that I get here.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.768
I have things to do, people to impress,

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.540
and places to go."

00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:14.784
And they said, "Yeah!"

00:04:14.808 --> 00:04:16.312
(Laughter)

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.732
You say it long enough,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.544
it starts to be a part of you.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:27.986
(Applause)

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.367
I gave a quiz, 20 questions.

00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:33.462
A student missed 18.

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.927
I put a "+2" on his paper
and a big smiley face.

00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:39.504
(Laughter)

00:04:39.528 --> 00:04:42.647
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:44.608
I said, "Yes."

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:45.878
(Laughter)

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:49.057
He said, "Then why'd you
put a smiley face?"

00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.305
I said, "Because you're on a roll.

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.190
You got two right.
You didn't miss them all."

00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:55.377
(Laughter)

00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:58.796
I said, "And when we review this,
won't you do better?"

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.325
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.957
You see, "-18" sucks
all the life out of you.

00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:07.039
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:19.038
For years, I watched my mother
take the time at recess to review,

00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:21.870
go on home visits in the afternoon,

00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:24.629
buy combs and brushes
and peanut butter and crackers

00:05:24.653 --> 00:05:27.363
to put in her desk drawer
for kids that needed to eat,

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:30.626
and a washcloth and some soap
for the kids who didn't smell so good.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.912
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:34.299
(Laughter)

00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:36.192
And kids can be cruel.

00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:39.379
And so she kept those things in her desk,

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:42.904
and years later, after she retired,

00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:45.521
I watched some of those
same kids come through

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.505
and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.330
you made a difference in my life.

00:05:50.044 --> 00:05:51.256
You made it work for me.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.294
You made me feel like I was somebody,

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.681
when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.

00:05:56.705 --> 00:05:58.808
And I want you to just
see what I've become."

00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:01.931
And when my mama died two years ago at 92,

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:05.135
there were so many former
students at her funeral,

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.849
it brought tears to my eyes,
not because she was gone,

00:06:07.873 --> 00:06:11.256
but because she left
a legacy of relationships

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.968
that could never disappear.

00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:17.511
Can we stand to have more relationships?

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:18.690
Absolutely.

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:21.824
Will you like all your children?
Of course not.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.102
(Laughter)

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:27.024
And you know your toughest
kids are never absent.

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.017
(Laughter)

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:30.657
Never.

00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.115
You won't like them all,

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.525
and the tough ones show up for a reason.

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.705
It's the connection.
It's the relationships.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.997
So teachers become
great actors and great actresses,

00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.260
and we come to work
when we don't feel like it,

00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:53.310
and we're listening to policy
that doesn't make sense,

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.647
and we teach anyway.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:00.555
We teach anyway,
because that's what we do.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.221
Teaching and learning should bring joy.

00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:06.255
How powerful would our world be

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.005
if we had kids who were
not afraid to take risks,

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.410
who were not afraid to think,

00:07:11.434 --> 00:07:12.766
and who had a champion?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.231
Every child deserves a champion,

00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:17.441
an adult who will never give up on them,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:20.433
who understands the power of connection,

00:07:20.457 --> 00:07:24.069
and insists that they become
the best that they can possibly be.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.594
Is this job tough? You betcha.

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:28.837
Oh God, you betcha.

00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:32.071
But it is not impossible.

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:33.828
We can do this. We're educators.

00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:36.112
We're born to make a difference.

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:37.503
Thank you so much.

00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:42.820
(Applause)
