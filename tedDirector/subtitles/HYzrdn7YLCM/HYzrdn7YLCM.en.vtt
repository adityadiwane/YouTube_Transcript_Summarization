00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.796
Two weeks ago,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.196
I was sitting at the kitchen table
with my wife Katya,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.980
and we were talking about
what I was going to talk about today.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.956
We have an 11-year-old son;
his name is Lincoln.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.460
He was sitting at the same table,
doing his math homework.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.076
And during a pause
in my conversation with Katya,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.836
I looked over at Lincoln

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.820
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.734
by a recollection of a client of mine.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.116
My client was a guy named Will.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.589
He was from North Texas.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.916
He never knew his father very well,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.620
because his father left his mom
while she was pregnant with him.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.956
And so, he was destined
to be raised by a single mom,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.457
which might have been all right

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:12.161
except that this particular single mom
was a paranoid schizophrenic,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.036
and when Will was five years old,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
she tried to kill him
with a butcher knife.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.596
She was taken away by authorities
and placed in a psychiatric hospital,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.876
and so for the next several years
Will lived with his older brother,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.980
until he committed suicide
by shooting himself through the heart.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.156
And after that Will bounced around
from one family member to another,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.900
until, by the time he was nine years old,
he was essentially living on his own.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.836
That morning that I was sitting
with Katya and Lincoln,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.740
I looked at my son, and I realized
that when my client, Will, was his age,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.900
he'd been living by himself for two years.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.236
Will eventually joined a gang

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.636
and committed a number
of very serious crimes,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.940
including, most seriously of all,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.660
a horrible, tragic murder.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.020
And Will was ultimately executed
as punishment for that crime.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.715
But I don't want to talk today
about the morality of capital punishment.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.596
I certainly think that my client
shouldn't have been executed,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.516
but what I would like to do today instead

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.596
is talk about the death penalty
in a way I've never done before,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.620
in a way that is
entirely noncontroversial.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.516
I think that's possible,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.756
because there is a corner
of the death penalty debate --

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.076
maybe the most important corner --

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.836
where everybody agrees,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.116
where the most ardent
death penalty supporters

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.540
and the most vociferous abolitionists
are on exactly the same page.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.060
That's the corner I want to explore.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.396
Before I do that, though,
I want to spend a couple of minutes

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.996
telling you how
a death penalty case unfolds,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.196
and then I want to tell you two lessons

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.276
that I have learned over the last 20 years
as a death penalty lawyer

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.260
from watching well more
than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.620
You can think of a death penalty case
as a story that has four chapters.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.722
The first chapter of every case
is exactly the same, and it is tragic.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.196
It begins with the murder
of an innocent human being,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.956
and it's followed by a trial

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.956
where the murderer
is convicted and sent to death row,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.620
and that death sentence is ultimately
upheld by the state appellate court.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.796
The second chapter consists
of a complicated legal proceeding

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.660
known as a state habeas corpus appeal.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.396
The third chapter is an even
more complicated legal proceeding

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.916
known as a federal
habeas corpus proceeding.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.756
And the fourth chapter is one
where a variety of things can happen.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.276
The lawyers might file
a clemency petition,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.796
they might initiate
even more complex litigation,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.276
or they might not do anything at all.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.140
But that fourth chapter
always ends with an execution.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.356
When I started representing
death row inmates more than 20 years ago,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.036
people on death row
did not have a right to a lawyer

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.716
in either the second
or the fourth chapter of this story.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.356
They were on their own.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.796
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.700
that they acquired a right to a lawyer
during the third chapter of the story.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.236
So what all of these death row inmates
had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.980
to handle their legal proceedings.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.996
The problem is that there were
way more guys on death row

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.276
than there were lawyers

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.036
who had both the interest
and the expertise to work on these cases.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.720
And so inevitably,

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:59.676
lawyers drifted to cases
that were already in chapter four --

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.076
that makes sense, of course.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.076
Those are the cases that are most urgent;

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.584
those are the guys
who are closest to being executed.

00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:07.425
Some of these lawyers were successful;

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.756
they managed to get
new trials for their clients.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.636
Others of them managed
to extend the lives of their clients,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.556
sometimes by years, sometimes by months.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.996
But the one thing that didn't happen

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.956
was that there was never
a serious and sustained decline

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.756
in the number of annual
executions in Texas.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.716
In fact, as you can see from this graph,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.116
from the time that the Texas
execution apparatus got efficient

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.196
in the mid- to late 1990s,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.030
there have only been a couple of years

00:05:34.054 --> 00:05:37.534
where the number of annual
executions dipped below 20.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.196
In a typical year in Texas,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.116
we're averaging about two people a month.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.316
In some years in Texas,
we've executed close to 40 people,

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.356
and this number has never significantly
declined over the last 15 years.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.756
And yet, at the same time
that we continue to execute

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.036
about the same number
of people every year,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.916
the number of people who we're
sentencing to death on an annual basis

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.540
has dropped rather steeply.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.156
So we have this paradox,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.396
which is that the number
of annual executions has remained high

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.436
but the number of new
death sentences has gone down.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.836
Why is that?

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.716
It can't be attributed
to a decline in the murder rate,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.316
because the murder
rate has not declined nearly so steeply

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.780
as the red line
on that graph has gone down.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.676
What has happened instead

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.996
is that juries have started to sentence
more and more people to prison

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.316
for the rest of their lives
without the possibility of parole,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.020
rather than sending them
to the execution chamber.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.796
Why has that happened?

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.956
It hasn't happened
because of a dissolution

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.156
of popular support for the death penalty.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.036
Death penalty opponents
take great solace in the fact

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.516
that death penalty support in Texas
is at an all-time low.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.676
Do you know what all-time low
in Texas means?

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.916
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.716
Now, that's really good
compared to the mid-1980s,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.396
when it was in excess of 80 percent,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.316
but we can't explain
the decline in death sentences

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.556
and the affinity for life
without the possibility of parole

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.956
by an erosion of support
for the death penalty,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.196
because people still support
the death penalty.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.300
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.236
What's happened is that lawyers
who represent death row inmates

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.836
have shifted their focus
to earlier and earlier chapters

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.260
of the death penalty story.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.156
So 25 years ago,
they focused on chapter four.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.516
And they went from
chapter four 25 years ago

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.516
to chapter three in the late 1980s.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.036
And they went from chapter three
in the late 1980s

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.476
to chapter two in the mid-1990s.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.556
And beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.556
they began to focus
on chapter one of the story.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.476
Now, you might think
that this decline in death sentences

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.756
and the increase
in the number of life sentences

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.276
is a good thing or a bad thing.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.796
I don't want to have a conversation
about that today.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.076
All that I want to tell you
is that the reason that this has happened

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.076
is because death penalty lawyers
have understood

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.863
that the earlier you intervene in a case,

00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:09.300
the greater the likelihood that
you're going to save your client's life.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.676
That's the first thing I've learned.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.796
Here's the second thing I learned:

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.700
My client Will was
not the exception to the rule;

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.500
he was the rule.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.036
I sometimes say, if you tell me
the name of a death row inmate --

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.716
doesn't matter what state he's in,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.876
doesn't matter
if I've ever met him before --

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.472
I'll write his biography for you.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.676
And eight out of 10 times,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.420
the details of that biography
will be more or less accurate.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.996
And the reason for that is that 80 percent
of the people on death row

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.236
are people who came from the same sort
of dysfunctional family that Will did.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.436
Eighty percent of the people on death row

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.020
are people who had exposure
to the juvenile justice system.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.700
That's the second lesson
that I've learned.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.516
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.340
where everybody's going to agree.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.276
People in this room might disagree

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.956
about whether Will
should have been executed,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.316
but I think everybody would agree

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.956
that the best possible
version of his story

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.180
would be a story
where no murder ever occurs.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.940
How do we do that?

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.516
When our son Lincoln was working
on that math problem two weeks ago,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.836
it was a big, gnarly problem.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.316
And he was learning how,
when you have a big old gnarly problem,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.276
sometimes the solution
is to slice it into smaller problems.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.156
That's what we do for most problems --

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.316
in math, in physics,
even in social policy --

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.220
we slice them into smaller,
more manageable problems.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.396
But every once in a while,
as Dwight Eisenhower said,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.980
the way you solve a problem
is to make it bigger.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.196
The way we solve this problem

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.340
is to make the issue
of the death penalty bigger.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.396
We have to say, all right.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.460
We have these four chapters
of a death penalty story,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.020
but what happens before that story begins?

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.940
How can we intervene
in the life of a murderer

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.860
before he's a murderer?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.236
What options do we have
to nudge that person off of the path

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.636
that is going to lead
to a result that everybody --

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.436
death penalty supporters
and death penalty opponents --

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.596
still think is a bad result:

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.580
the murder of an innocent human being?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.076
You know, sometimes people say
that something isn't rocket science.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.396
And by that, what they mean
is rocket science is really complicated

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.916
and this problem that we're
talking about now is really simple.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.356
Well that's rocket science;

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.420
that's the mathematical expression
for the thrust created by a rocket.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.100
What we're talking about today
is just as complicated.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.220
What we're talking about today
is also rocket science.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.220
My client Will and 80 percent
of the people on death row

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.036
had five chapters in their lives

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.276
that came before the four chapters
of the death penalty story.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.956
I think of these five chapters
as points of intervention,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.636
places in their lives

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.236
when our society
could've intervened in their lives

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.236
and nudged them off of the path
that they were on

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.876
that created a consequence that we all --

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.796
death penalty supporters
or death penalty opponents --

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.500
say was a bad result.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.756
Now, during each of these five chapters:

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.716
when his mother was pregnant with him;

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.796
in his early childhood years;

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.396
when he was in elementary school;

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.762
when he was in middle school
and then high school;

00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:52.078
and when he was
in the juvenile justice system --

00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:53.777
during each of those five chapters,

00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:56.856
there were a wide variety of things
that society could have done.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.476
In fact, if we just imagine

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.196
that there are five
different modes of intervention,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.436
the way that society could intervene
in each of those five chapters,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.716
and we could mix and match them
any way we want,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.756
there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 --
possible strategies

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.076
that we could embrace

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.220
in order to nudge kids like Will
off of the path that they're on.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.316
So I'm not standing here today
with the solution.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.820
But the fact that we
still have a lot to learn,

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.276
that doesn't mean
that we don't know a lot already.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.076
We know from experience in other states

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.876
that there are a wide variety
of modes of intervention

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.516
that we could be using in Texas,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.316
and in every other state
that isn't using them,

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.966
in order to prevent a consequence
that we all agree is bad.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.860
I'll just mention a few.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.196
I won't talk today
about reforming the legal system.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.476
That's probably a topic

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.956
that is best reserved
for a room full of lawyers and judges.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.956
Instead, let me talk
about a couple of modes of intervention

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.076
that we can all help accomplish,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.862
because they are modes of intervention
that will come about

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:09.956
when legislators and policymakers,
when taxpayers and citizens,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.036
agree that that's
what we ought to be doing

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.396
and that's how we ought
to be spending our money.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.436
We could be providing early childhood care

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.620
for economically disadvantaged
and otherwise troubled kids,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.996
and we could be doing it for free.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.683
And we could be nudging kids like Will
off of the path that we're on.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.220
There are other states
that do that, but we don't.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.436
We could be providing special schools,

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.236
at both the high school level
and the middle school level,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.396
but even in K-5,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.396
that target economically
and otherwise disadvantaged kids,

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.876
and particularly kids who have had
exposure to the juvenile justice system.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.036
There are a handful
of states that do that;

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.260
Texas doesn't.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.196
There's one other thing we can be doing --
well, there are a bunch of other things --

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.556
there's one other thing
that I'm going to mention,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.866
and this is going to be the only
controversial thing that I say today.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.236
We could be intervening
much more aggressively

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.436
into dangerously dysfunctional homes,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.396
and getting kids out of them

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.820
before their moms pick up butcher knives
and threaten to kill them.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.940
If we're going to do that,
we need a place to put them.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.476
Even if we do all of those things,

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.676
some kids are going
to fall through the cracks

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.956
and they're going to end up
in that last chapter

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.516
before the murder story begins,

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.156
they're going to end up
in the juvenile justice system.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.220
And even if that happens,
it's not yet too late.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.636
There's still time to nudge them,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.636
if we think about nudging them
rather than just punishing them.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.756
There are two professors
in the Northeast --

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.436
one at Yale and one at Maryland --

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.500
they set up a school
that is attached to a juvenile prison.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.476
And the kids are in prison,
but they go to school

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.076
from eight in the morning
until four in the afternoon.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.796
Now, it was logistically difficult.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.076
They had to recruit teachers
who wanted to teach inside a prison,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.958
they had to establish strict separation

00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:04.236
between the people who work at the school
and the prison authorities,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.596
and most dauntingly of all,

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.516
they needed to invent a new curriculum
because you know what?

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.606
People don't come into and out of prison
on a semester basis.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.396
(Laughter)

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.580
But they did all those things.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.740
Now, what do all of these things
have in common?

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.700
What all of these things have in common
is that they cost money.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.956
Some of the people in the room
might be old enough

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.396
to remember the guy
on the old oil filter commercial.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.860
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now
or you can pay me later."

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.660
What we're doing
in the death penalty system

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.900
is we're paying later.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.036
But the thing is
that for every 15,000 dollars

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.236
that we spend intervening

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.996
in the lives of economically
and otherwise disadvantaged kids

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.316
in those earlier chapters,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.380
we save 80,000 dollars
in crime-related costs down the road.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.684
Even if you don't agree that
there's a moral imperative that we do it,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.180
it just makes economic sense.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.651
I want to tell you about the last
conversation that I had with Will.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.620
It was the day that
he was going to be executed,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.356
and we were just talking.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.780
There was nothing left to do in his case.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.300
And we were talking about his life.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.860
And he was talking first about his dad,
who he hardly knew, who had died,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.060
and then about his mom,
who he did know, who was still alive.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.340
And I said to him,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.060
"I know the story.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.060
I've read the records.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.460
I know that she tried to kill you."

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.796
I said, "But I've always wondered

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.796
whether you really
actually remember that."

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.836
I said, "I don't remember anything
from when I was five years old.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.020
Maybe you just remember
somebody telling you."

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.036
And he looked at me and he leaned forward,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.436
and he said, "Professor," --

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.156
he'd known me for 12 years,
he still called me Professor.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.196
He said, "Professor,
I don't mean any disrespect by this,

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.676
but when your mama
picks up a butcher knife

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.076
that looks bigger than you are,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.876
and chases you through the house
screaming she's going to kill you,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.196
and you have to lock yourself
in the bathroom

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.476
and lean against the door

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.940
and holler for help
until the police get there,"

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.196
he looked at me and he said,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.379
"that's something you don't forget."

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.436
I hope there's one thing
you all won't forget:

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.796
In between the time
you arrived here this morning

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.396
and the time we break for lunch,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.876
there are going to be
four homicides in the United States.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.076
We're going to devote
enormous social resources

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.356
to punishing the people
who commit those crimes,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.596
and that's appropriate

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.996
because we should punish
people who do bad things.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.453
But three of those crimes are preventable.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.396
If we make the picture bigger

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.780
and devote our attention
to the earlier chapters,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.076
then we're never going
to write the first sentence

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.860
that begins the death penalty story.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.156
Thank you.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.601
(Applause)
