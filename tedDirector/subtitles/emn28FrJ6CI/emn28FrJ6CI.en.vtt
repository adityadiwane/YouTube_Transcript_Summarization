00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
But as a physicist,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
I thought, well if you give me some data,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So as a naive New Zealander

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Can you get me some information?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
(Laughter)

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
No. So I had to think a little harder.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And I saw that there was information there.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
There was data within the streams of news that we consume.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
All this noise around us actually has information.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
So what I started thinking was,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
If we can get enough of these streams of information together,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
we can perhaps start to understand the war.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
an interdisciplinary team of scientists,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
of economists, mathematicians.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
We did it in three steps.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information --

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
That database contained

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
the timing of attacks,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
the location, the size and the weapons used.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
we just have to know how to pull it out.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
What would that tell us?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
So we started doing this. And you can see here

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
on the horizontal axis

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
you've got the number of people killed in an attack

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
or the size of the attack.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
So we plot data for sample on this.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
You see some sort of random distribution --

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
or 47 attacks where seven people were killed.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
You take all of the conflict,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
all of the chaos, all of the noise,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and out of that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
comes this precise mathematical distribution

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
This blew our mind.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Why should a conflict like Iraq have this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
as its fundamental signature?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Why should there be order in war?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
We didn't really understand that.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
So we looked at a few more conflicts.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
and we looked at Senegal.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
This wasn't supposed to happen.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
These are different wars, with different religious factions,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
are the same.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So we went a little wider.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
From Peru to Indonesia,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
we studied this same pattern again.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
And we found that not only

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
were the distributions these straight lines,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
but the slope of these lines, they clustered around

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
this value of alpha equals 2.5.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And we could generate an equation

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
that could predict the likelihood of an attack.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
What we're saying here

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
is the probability of an attack killing X number of people

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
in a country like Iraq

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
raised to the power of negative alpha.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.160
And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
So what?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
How do we explain this?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
And what we really found was that alpha,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
if we think about it, is the organizational

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
structure of the insurgency.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
which is really the distribution

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
of the group strength carrying out the attacks.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
So we look at a process of group dynamics:

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.160
coalescence and fragmentation,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
groups coming together, groups breaking apart.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
in places like Iraq?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
We can run these simulations.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
to explain the patterns that we see

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
all around the conflicts around the world.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
So what's going on?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
have the same patterns?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
Now what I believe is going on is that

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
And it turns out there is only one solution

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
to fight a much stronger enemy.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
you don't exist.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
So every insurgent force that is ongoing,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
every conflict that is ongoing,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
it's going to look something like this.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And that is what we think is happening.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Taking it forward, how do we change it?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
How do we end a war like Iraq?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
What does it look like?

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
This is what wars look like when they continue.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
We've got to change that.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
We can push it up:

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
the forces become more fragmented;

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
there is more of them, but they are weaker.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Or we push it down:

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
they're more robust; there is less groups;

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
but perhaps you can sit and talk to them.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
So this graph here, I'm going to show you now.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
No one has seen this before. This is literally

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
stuff that we've come through last week.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
the wars around the world look like.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
until the Samarra bombings in the

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Iraqi elections of '06.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
to a fragmented state.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
This is when the surge happens.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160
And depending on who you ask,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
the surge was supposed to push it up even further.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
The opposite happened.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
The groups became stronger.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
They became more robust.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And this tells me one of two things.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Either we're back where we started

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
and the surge has had no effect;

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
that we can start to think about maybe moving out.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
I don't know what the answer is to that.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
to answer that question.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Thank you.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
(Applause)
