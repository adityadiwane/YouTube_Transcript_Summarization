00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I'd like to talk a little bit this morning

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
about what happens if we move from design

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
to design thinking.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Now this rather old photo up there

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
something like 25 years ago.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and my task was to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
make this thing a little bit more modern,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
a little bit easier to use.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Unfortunately, not very long afterwards

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
the company went out of business.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
I put an attractive shell around some new technology.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Again, 18 months later,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
the product was obsolete.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
but eventually it occurred to me that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
maybe what passed for design

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
wasn't all that important --

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
making things more attractive,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
making them a bit easier to use,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
making them more marketable.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
By focusing on a design,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
maybe just a single product,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I was being incremental

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
and not having much of an impact.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
But I think this small view of design

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
is a relatively recent phenomenon,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and in fact really emerged

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
in the latter half of the 20th century

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
as design became a tool of consumerism.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
So when we talk about design today,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
we're often talking about products like these.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Important? Not so very.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
But this wasn't always the way.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And I'd like to suggest that if we take

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160
a different view of design,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
and focus less on the object

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
and more on design thinking as an approach,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.160
including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Both great designs and actually very innovative too.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
His greatest creation

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
runs actually right through here in Oxford.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
It's called the Great Western Railway.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And as a kid I grew up very close to here,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and one of my favorite things to do

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
was to cycle along by the side of the railway

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
waiting for the great big express trains to roar past.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
"Rain, Steam and Speed".

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
was the experience of floating across the countryside.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Now, this was back in the 19th century.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
that had ever yet been made,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.160
and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
with just trying to design the best railway journey.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160
He imagined an integrated transportation system

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
on a train in London

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
and disembark from a ship in New York.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160
One journey from London to New York.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
to take care of the second half of that journey.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Now, Brunel was working 100 years before

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
the emergence of the design profession,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
but I think he was using design thinking

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.160
to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
the business school professor at the University of Toronto,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
calls integrative thinking.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
and opposing constraints

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
to create new solutions.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
In the case of design, that means

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160
balancing desirability, what humans need,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
with technical feasibility,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and economic viability.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
With innovations like the Great Western,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.160
we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.160
So somehow, we went from this to this.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.160
to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
working on small things.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
As our industrial society matured,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
so design became a profession

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
and it focused on an ever smaller canvas

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
until it came to stand for aesthetics,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
image and fashion.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
There we go.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
But I do think that perhaps design

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
is getting big again.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
And that's happening through

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
the application of design thinking

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160
to new kinds of problems --

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
to global warming, to education,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
And I'd like to talk about some of those

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
just for the next few minutes.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
The first of those is that design is

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
human-centered.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
It may integrate technology and economics,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
but it starts with what humans need, or might need.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
What makes technology useful and usable?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
But that is more than simply good ergonomics,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
putting the buttons in the right place.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
It's often about understanding culture and context

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
before we even know where to start to have ideas.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160
they wanted to understand what the aspirations

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
and motivations were of these school children

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.160
to understand how they might play a role

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.160
in screening their parents.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
for the developing world.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160
to fit these hearing aids.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.160
In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
So it took a team working in India

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
with patients and community health workers

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
to understand how a PDA

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and an application on a PDA

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
might replace those technicians

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
in a fitting and diagnostic service.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
Instead of starting with technology,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
the team started with people and culture.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
So if human need is the place to start,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
then design thinking rapidly moves on to

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
learning by making.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Instead of thinking about what to build,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
building in order to think.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
And the faster we do that,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
the faster our ideas evolve.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Now, much has been said and written about

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.160
to cross-subsidize those who cannot.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Now, they are very efficient,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.160
but they are also very innovative.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
When I visited them a few years ago,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
what really impressed me was their willingness

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
to prototype their ideas very early.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
This is the manufacturing facility

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
They make their own intraocular lenses.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160
These are the lenses that replace those

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
that are damaged by cataracts.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Because they brought the cost down

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160
from $200 a pair,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.160
down to just $4 a pair.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Partly they did this by instead of building

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.160
a fancy new factory,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.160
they used the basement of one of their hospitals.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
And instead of installing the large-scale machines

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
used by western producers,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
and have recently moved into a custom factory.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160
So if human need is the place to start,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.160
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
the shift from a passive relationship

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
between consumer and producer

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
to the active engagement of everyone

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
in experiences that are meaningful,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
productive and profitable.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
and take that a little bit further and say that

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
I think the design of participatory systems,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
in which many more forms of value

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
beyond simply cash

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
are both created and measured,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.160
is going to be the major theme, not only for design,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160
but also for our economy as we go forward.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.160
created what became Britain's welfare state

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160
in which he hoped that every citizen

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
would be an active participant

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
in their own social well-being.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
By the time he wrote his third report,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
he confessed that he had failed

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.160
and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160
and Hugo Manassei of Participle

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
have taken this idea of participation,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
they are suggesting a framework

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.160
for reinventing the welfare state.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
they worked with residents in Southwark, South London

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
and a small team of designers

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
to develop a new membership organization

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
to help the elderly with household tasks.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
Designs were refined and developed

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
with 150 older people and their families

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.160
before the service was launched earlier this year.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
We can take this idea of participation

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
perhaps to its logical conclusion

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
and say that design may have its greatest impact

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
when it's taken out of the hands of designers

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
and put into the hands of everyone.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
Kaiser Permanente

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
study the topic of improving the patient experience,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.160
and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
and change shift.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
Through a program of observational research,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160
brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
they've developed a completely new way to change shift.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
They went from retreating to the nurse's station

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
to discuss the various states and needs of patients,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
to developing a system that happened on the ward

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
in front of patients, using a simple software tool.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.160
down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
When you multiply that by all the nurses

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
And this is just one of thousands

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.160
of opportunities in healthcare alone.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.160
around design thinking

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
and some of the new kinds of projects

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
that they're being applied to.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.160
and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
And that connection is change.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
In times of change we need

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
new alternatives, new ideas.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160
Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
when all of life and our economy

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
was being reinvented.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.160
Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
and indeed they are part of the problem today.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160
But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
And that change is forcing us to question

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
quite fundamental aspects of our society --

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160
how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.160
And in these times of change, we need these new choices

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.160
because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
So why design thinking?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.160
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160
Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
where we make the best choice out of available alternatives,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
it encourages us to take a divergent approach,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
to explore new alternatives, new solutions,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
new ideas that have not existed before.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
But before we go through that process of divergence,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
there is actually quite an important first step.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
What's the design brief?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.160
"How do I take a train from London to New York?"

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.160
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.160
So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
How might we improve access to safe drinking water

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160
for the world's poorest people,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
and at the same time stimulate innovation

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.160
amongst local water providers?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
So instead of having a bunch of American designers

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.160
we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
We teamed designers and investment experts up with

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
11 water organizations across India.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
And through workshops they developed

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
innovative new products, services, and business models.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160
We hosted a competition

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
and then funded five of those organizations

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
to develop their ideas.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
So they developed and iterated these ideas.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.160
to help design new social marketing campaigns,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
community outreach strategies, business models,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
new water vessels for storing water

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
and carts for delivering water.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
And the same process is just getting underway

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
with NGOs in East Africa.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
So for me, this project shows

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
kind of how far we can go from

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
some of those sort of small things

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
that I was working on

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
at the beginning of my career.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.160
That by focusing on the needs of humans

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160
and by using prototypes

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.160
to move ideas along quickly,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
by getting the process out of the hands of designers,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160
and by getting the active participation of the community,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.160
we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
we can have a bigger impact.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
So that's one thing that we've been working on.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
to know what this community thinks we could work on.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
What kinds of questions do we think

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
design thinking could be used to tackle?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
And if you've got any ideas

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
then feel free, you can post them to Twitter.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.160
And the list looked something like this a little while ago.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.160
And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
by using the same hash code.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.160
So I'd like to believe that design thinking

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
actually can make a difference,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
that it can help create new ideas

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
and new innovations,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
beyond the latest High Street products.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.160
To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.160
more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160
And the first step is to start asking the right questions.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
Thank you very much.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.160
(Applause)
