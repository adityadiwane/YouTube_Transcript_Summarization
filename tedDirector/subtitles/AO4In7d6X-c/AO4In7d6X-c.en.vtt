00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.885
(Laughter)

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.473
(Laughter)

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.860
That's SpotMini.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:39.502
He'll be back in a little while.

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:40.690
I --

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:44.552
(Applause)

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:47.209
I love building robots.

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:50.871
And my long-term goal is to build robots

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:52.977
that can do what people and animals do.

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.063
And there's three things in particular

00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.244
that we're interested in.

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.310
One is balance and dynamic mobility,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.964
the second one is mobile manipulation,

00:01:05.988 --> 00:01:08.353
and the third one is mobile perception.

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.855
So, dynamic mobility and balance --

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.516
I'm going to do a demo for you.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:16.646
I'm standing here, balancing.

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.835
I can see you're not very impressed.
OK, how about now?

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.019
(Laughter)

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:23.236
How about now?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.303
(Applause)

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.422
Those simple capabilities mean that people
can go almost anywhere on earth,

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:32.098
on any kind of terrain.

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:34.777
We want to capture that for robots.

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:37.164
What about manipulation?

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:39.330
I'm holding this clicker in my hand;

00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:40.646
I'm not even looking at it,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.400
and I can manipulate it
without any problem.

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:46.064
But even more important,

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:51.248
I can move my body while I hold
the manipulator, the clicker,

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.289
and stabilize and coordinate my body,

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.835
and I can even walk around.

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.265
And that means
I can move around in the world

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.591
and expand the range
of my arms and my hands

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.784
and really be able to handle
almost anything.

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:06.400
So that's mobile manipulation.

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:09.229
And all of you can do this.

00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:11.170
Third is perception.

00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:14.459
I'm looking at a room
with over 1,000 people in it,

00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:19.258
and my amazing visual system
can see every one of you --

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.243
you're all stable in space,

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:22.586
even when I move my head,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.156
even when I move around.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.959
That kind of mobile perception
is really important for robots

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:29.627
that are going to move and act

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:30.864
out in the world.

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.143
I'm going to give you
a little status report

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:38.013
on where we are in developing robots
toward these ends.

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:44.878
The first three robots are all
dynamically stabilized robots.

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:47.550
This one goes back
a little over 10 years ago --

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:48.742
"BigDog."

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.076
It's got a gyroscope
that helps stabilize it.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.436
It's got sensors and a control computer.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.627
Here's a Cheetah robot
that's running with a galloping gait,

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.347
where it recycles its energy,

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.938
it bounces on the ground,

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:03.516
and it's computing all the time

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.427
in order to keep itself
stabilized and propelled.

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.762
And here's a bigger robot

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:12.491
that's got such good
locomotion using its legs,

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:13.919
that it can go in deep snow.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.354
This is about 10 inches deep,

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:18.489
and it doesn't really have any trouble.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.795
This is Spot, a new generation of robot --

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.627
just slightly older than the one
that came out onstage.

00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:28.090
And we've been asking the question --

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:30.088
you've all heard about drone delivery:

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.735
Can we deliver packages
to your houses with drones?

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.546
Well, what about plain old
legged-robot delivery?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.702
(Laughter)

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:40.123
So we've been taking our robot
to our employees' homes

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:41.730
to see whether we could get in --

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.778
(Laughter)

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:44.030
the various access ways.

00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:45.938
And believe me, in the Boston area,

00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:49.136
there's every manner
of stairway twists and turns.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.397
So it's a real challenge.

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:53.238
But we're doing very well,
about 70 percent of the way.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.044
And here's mobile manipulation,

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.659
where we've put an arm on the robot,

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:01.017
and it's finding its way through the door.

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:04.901
Now, one of the important things
about making autonomous robots

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.145
is to make them not do
just exactly what you say,

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.310
but make them deal with the uncertainty
of what happens in the real world.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.065
So we have Steve there,
one of the engineers,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.697
giving the robot a hard time.

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:19.753
(Laughter)

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:23.967
And the fact that the programming
still tolerates all that disturbance --

00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:25.488
it does what it's supposed to.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:28.303
Here's another example,
where Eric is tugging on the robot

00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:29.625
as it goes up the stairs.

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:30.801
And believe me,

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:34.097
getting it to do what it's supposed to do
in those circumstances

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.462
is a real challenge,

00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:38.226
but the result is something
that's going to generalize

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.121
and make robots much more autonomous
than they would be otherwise.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.748
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:50.332
It's a third-generation humanoid
that we've been building.

00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:53.489
I'll tell you a little bit
about the hardware design later.

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:54.689
And we've been saying:

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:59.136
How close to human levels
of performance and speed could we get

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.735
in an ordinary task,

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.228
like moving boxes around on a conveyor?

00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:09.237
We're getting up to about two-thirds
of the speed that a human operates

00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:10.423
on average.

00:05:10.758 --> 00:05:13.687
And this robot is using both hands,
it's using its body,

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:14.880
it's stepping,

00:05:14.904 --> 00:05:17.631
so it's really an example
of dynamic stability,

00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.034
mobile manipulation

00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:20.669
and mobile perception.

00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:23.365
Here --

00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:25.812
(Laughter)

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.999
We actually have two Atlases.

00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:29.668
(Laughter)

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:33.594
Now, everything doesn't go exactly
the way it's supposed to.

00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:35.320
(Laughter)

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:39.846
(Laughter)

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:42.407
(Laughter)

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:47.836
And here's our latest robot,
called "Handle."

00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:52.575
Handle is interesting,
because it's sort of half like an animal,

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.913
and it's half something else

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.693
with these leg-like things and wheels.

00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:01.167
It's got its arms on
in kind of a funny way,

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.287
but it really does some remarkable things.

00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:06.642
It can carry 100 pounds.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.725
It's probably going to lift
more than that,

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:10.527
but so far we've done 100.

00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.987
It's got some pretty good
rough-terrain capability,

00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:14.439
even though it has wheels.

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.247
And Handle loves to put on a show.

00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:22.044
(Laughter)

00:06:24.644 --> 00:06:29.773
(Applause)

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.738
I'm going to give you
a little bit of robot religion.

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:38.685
A lot of people think that a robot
is a machine where there's a computer

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:40.343
that's telling it what to do,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.716
and the computer is listening
through its sensors.

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.753
But that's really only half of the story.

00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:49.886
The real story is
that the computer is on one side,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.854
making suggestions to the robot,

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.370
and on the other side
are the physics of the world.

00:06:54.778 --> 00:06:59.700
And that physics involves gravity,
friction, bouncing into things.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:02.073
In order to have a successful robot,

00:07:02.097 --> 00:07:06.688
my religion is that you have to do
a holistic design,

00:07:06.712 --> 00:07:10.265
where you're designing the software,
the hardware and the behavior

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:11.525
all at one time,

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:15.251
and all these parts really intermesh
and cooperate with each other.

00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:18.382
And when you get the perfect design,
you get a real harmony

00:07:18.406 --> 00:07:21.285
between all those parts
interacting with each other.

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:24.529
So it's half software and half hardware,

00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:25.844
plus the behavior.

00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:30.240
We've done some work lately
on the hardware, where we tried to go --

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:32.741
the picture on the left
is a conventional design,

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:35.665
where you have parts
that are all bolted together,

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:38.429
conductors, tubes, connectors.

00:07:38.453 --> 00:07:40.502
And on the right
is a more integrated thing;

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.927
it's supposed to look like
an anatomy drawing.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.840
Using the miracle of 3-D printing,

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:48.501
we're starting to build parts of robots

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:51.422
that look a lot more
like the anatomy of an animal.

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:54.790
So that's an upper-leg part
that has hydraulic pathways --

00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:56.744
actuators, filters --

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.148
all embedded, all printed as one piece,

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:02.374
and the whole structure is developed

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:05.434
with a knowledge of what the loads
and behavior are going to be,

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:08.361
which is available from data
recorded from robots

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:10.194
and simulations and things like that.

00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:13.155
So it's a data-driven hardware design.

00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:15.273
And using processes like that,

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:17.541
not only the upper leg
but some other things,

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:22.705
we've gotten our robots to go from big,
behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:26.348
that one on the right,
weighing almost 400 pounds --

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.481
down to the one in the middle
which was just in the video,

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:31.068
weighs about 190 pounds,

00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:32.789
just a little bit more than me,

00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:34.299
and we have a new one,

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:37.065
which is working but I'm not
going to show it to you yet,

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:38.251
on the left,

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:39.919
which weighs just 165 pounds,

00:08:39.943 --> 00:08:42.209
with all the same
strength and capabilities.

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:44.963
So these things are really getting
better very quickly.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.542
So it's time for Spot to come back out,

00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:53.314
and we're going to demonstrate
a little bit of mobility,

00:08:53.338 --> 00:08:54.938
dexterity and perception.

00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:59.445
This is Seth Davis,
who's my robot wrangler today,

00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:02.509
and he's giving Spot
some general direction

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:04.359
by steering it around,

00:09:04.383 --> 00:09:07.454
but all the coordination
of the legs and the sensors

00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:09.987
is done by the robot's computers on board.

00:09:10.543 --> 00:09:13.989
The robot can walk
with a number of different gaits;

00:09:14.013 --> 00:09:16.172
it's got a gyro,

00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:17.533
or a solid-state gyro,

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.977
an IMU on board.

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:22.469
Obviously, it's got a battery,
and things like that.

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:25.858
One of the cool things
about a legged robot is,

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.331
it's omnidirectional.

00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:30.128
In addition to going forward,
it can go sideways,

00:09:31.413 --> 00:09:32.853
it can turn in place.

00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:38.750
And this robot
is a little bit of a show-off.

00:09:39.675 --> 00:09:41.635
It loves to use its dynamic gaits,

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:42.817
like running --

00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.885
(Laughter)

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:45.425
And it's got one more.

00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:48.934
(Laughter)

00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:53.094
Now if it were really a show-off,
it would be hopping on one foot,

00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:54.286
but, you know.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.353
Now, Spot has a set of cameras
here, stereo cameras,

00:09:58.377 --> 00:10:00.207
and we have a feed up in the center.

00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:02.415
It's kind of dark out in the audience,

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:05.659
but it's going to use those cameras
in order to look at the terrain

00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:06.856
right in front of it,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.641
while it goes over
these obstacles back here.

00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:12.978
For this demo, Seth is steering,

00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:15.507
but the robot's doing
all its own terrain planning.

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.033
This is a terrain map,

00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:22.227
where the data from the cameras
is being developed in real time,

00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:25.488
showing the red spots,
which are where it doesn't want to step,

00:10:25.512 --> 00:10:27.503
and the green spots are the good places.

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.976
And here it's treating
them like stepping-stones.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.755
So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:34.052
and it adjusts its stride,

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.537
and there's a ton of planning

00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:37.802
that has to go into
an operation like that,

00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:40.088
and it does all
that planning in real time,

00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:42.542
where it adjusts the steps
a little bit longer

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:43.842
or a little bit shorter.

00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:47.646
Now we're going to change it
into a different mode,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.093
where it's just going to treat
the blocks like terrain

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.836
and decide whether to step up or down

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.145
as it goes.

00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:00.054
So this is using dynamic balance

00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:01.936
and mobile perception,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.347
because it has to coordinate what it sees
along with how it's moving.

00:11:08.988 --> 00:11:13.306
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.

00:11:14.337 --> 00:11:16.827
Some of you may see that
as a head and a neck,

00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:18.436
but believe me, it's an arm.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.225
Seth is driving it around.

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:24.017
He's actually driving the hand
and the body is following.

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:28.174
So the two are coordinated
in the way I was talking about before --

00:11:28.198 --> 00:11:30.062
in the way people can do that.

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:34.729
In fact, one of the cool things
Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,"

00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:37.937
and it keeps its head
in one place in space,

00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:39.806
and it moves its body all around.

00:11:40.553 --> 00:11:43.155
There's a variation of this
that's called "twerking" --

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:44.195
(Laughter)

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:46.042
but we're not going to use that today.

00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:47.137
(Laughter)

00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.747
So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
Could you get me a soda?

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:55.066
For this demo,
Seth is not doing any driving.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.203
We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,

00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:59.764
and it's using these props
we've put on the stage

00:11:59.788 --> 00:12:01.181
to localize itself.

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:03.486
It's gone over to that location.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.392
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:08.202
to find the cup,

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.108
picks it up --

00:12:10.132 --> 00:12:12.083
and again, Seth's not driving.

00:12:13.372 --> 00:12:16.613
We've planned out a path for it to go --

00:12:16.637 --> 00:12:18.744
it looked like it was
going off the path --

00:12:18.768 --> 00:12:21.126
and now Seth's going
to take over control again,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.599
because I'm a little bit chicken
about having it do this by itself.

00:12:24.623 --> 00:12:25.999
Thank you, Spot.

00:12:28.231 --> 00:12:33.514
(Applause)

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:36.479
So, Spot:

00:12:36.503 --> 00:12:40.070
How do you feel about having just finished
your TED performance?

00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:43.703
(Laughter)

00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:45.220
Me, too!

00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:46.276
(Laughter)

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.116
Thank you all,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.535
and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.673
who did all the hard work behind this.

00:12:52.697 --> 00:12:54.820
(Applause)

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:05.222
Helen Walters: Marc,
come back in the middle.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:06.400
Thank you so much.

00:13:06.424 --> 00:13:08.519
Come over here, I have questions.

00:13:08.543 --> 00:13:11.958
So, you mentioned the UPS
and the package delivery.

00:13:11.982 --> 00:13:15.919
What are the other applications
that you see for your robots?

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:17.970
Marc Raibert: You know,
I think that robots

00:13:17.994 --> 00:13:20.400
that have the capabilities
I've been talking about

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:22.084
are going to be incredibly useful.

00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:24.605
About a year ago, I went to Fukushima

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.660
to see what the situation was there,

00:13:26.684 --> 00:13:28.561
and there's just a huge need

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:31.923
for machines that can go
into some of the dirty places

00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:33.915
and help remediate that.

00:13:34.528 --> 00:13:39.127
I think it won't be too long until
we have robots like this in our homes,

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:44.472
and one of the big needs
is to take care of the aging

00:13:44.496 --> 00:13:45.862
and invalids.

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:49.875
I think that it won't be too long
till we're using robots

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:52.361
to help take care of our parents,

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:56.800
or probably more likely,
have our children help take care of us.

00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:59.471
And there's a bunch of other things.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:00.861
I think the sky's the limit.

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:03.143
Many of the ideas
we haven't thought of yet,

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:06.762
and people like you will help us
think of new applications.

00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:08.373
HW: So what about the dark side?

00:14:08.397 --> 00:14:10.230
What about the military?

00:14:10.254 --> 00:14:11.757
Are they interested?

00:14:12.441 --> 00:14:16.075
MR: Sure, the military has been
a big funder of robotics.

00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:20.301
I don't think the military
is the dark side myself,

00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:24.196
but I think, as with all
advanced technology,

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.267
it can be used for all kinds of things.

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:27.932
HW: Awesome. Thank you so much.

00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:29.361
MR: OK, you're welcome.

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:30.537
Thank you.

00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.147
(Applause)
