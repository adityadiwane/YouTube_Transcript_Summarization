00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.580
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.940
[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.390
[whose wealth and resources
surpass all that Europe ever had,]

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.780
[whose altar is filled with gold.]

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.780
This chant is called the oríkì.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.820
My grandmother used to sing it
to me when I was a child in Nigeria.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.036
See, an oríkì is the song of praise
of the Yoruba people,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.820
and this particularly speaks
of treasures that the West does not have.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.756
Mama -- that's what
I call my grandmother --

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260
told me many stories
about Yoruba mythology.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.756
You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group
from the southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.916
and I was always fascinated
by these stories.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.140
I was always intrigued.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.780
And Yoruba culture has inspired
my art since I was a child.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.860
You see, African art is not just what
you buy at Harlem markets in New York.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.396
Every artist has a name,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.820
and every artist has a story.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.820
This is my story.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.076
See, mama had tattoos
on her arms and her legs.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.356
As a child, I thought
she was born with them,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.660
with beautiful black lines
and detailed symbols.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.316
And then she told me

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.180
that they were actually symbols
from the Yoruba mythology.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.580
I never knew how this was going
to influence the artist that I am today.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.756
You see, as a young child,
I saw art everywhere.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.516
I remember the house we lived in
in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.116
We had marble floors,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.716
and you know, I would look
at the marble floors,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.396
and I would see all sorts
of patterns and designs in it,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.316
and I thought everybody could see them.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.596
So I would call my brother,
and I would be like,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.156
"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design,
see this pattern, see this mask."

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.636
And he would tell me,
"Laolu, I don't see anything."

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.756
So I would use ink, and I would trace out
what I saw on the floor.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.356
And then when my mom noticed,
she got really upset.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.956
(Laughter)

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.236
But that didn't stop me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.916
I switched from ink to chalk,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.916
because I got in trouble a lot
with my teachers and my parents.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.836
So I remember my mom said,
"Laolu, we are Christians.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.676
Why don't you draw like other people?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.996
Why don't you draw landscapes
or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.260
or maybe even draw Jesus?"

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.956
You know, I could paint
the whole house if I had a chance,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.916
but when I grew up,
I knew being an artist was not an option,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.916
so I wanted to be the person
my parents wanted me to be,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.516
so I went to law school.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.220
Of course, that's my dad there.
He was so proud that day.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.636
And this was what my notebooks
looked like in law school.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.236
(Laughter)

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.756
Of course I would miss classes,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.060
and I would make up excuses
why I wasn't going to class.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.676
But when I started working
at the Human Rights Commission

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.036
as a human rights attorney,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.260
my mind was elsewhere.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.620
I saw a very tough reality.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.196
I worked with children

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.036
who had to choose
between getting an education

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.980
and actually being forced into marriage.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.356
I was so frustrated
seeing all the injustice around me,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.956
and my only outlet was art,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.580
so I started painting.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.836
This piece is called "Dreamscape."

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.476
So when you zoom into this piece,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.220
you're going to see a girl child

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.756
and the accidental birth,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.740
the fact that our future
is controlled by where we are born.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.916
Now, the next one you see
a man and a man holding hands,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.796
a woman and a woman holding hands.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.956
You see, in Nigeria,
same-sex relationship is criminalized.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.860
You can actually get 14 years for that.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.516
With my art, I like to tell stories.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.756
Through my art,
I like to start a conversation.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.996
So in this one, you see the map of Africa,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.876
you see the questions, you see crying,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.076
and there you see syringes
plugged into Africa

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.196
and the natural resources
being drained out.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.756
So I asked myself, where does it go?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.260
Who benefits from all of this?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.716
You see, with my art,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.596
the way I weave my art around
the patterns, the masks, the stories,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.956
and the way I use my lines,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.716
it's all from the Yoruba culture.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.276
So in 2013, I made a big gamble.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.636
I quit my job and I moved to New York City
to practice art full time.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.210
Of course, my parents were like,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.960
"Oh, [it's just a phase.]
He'll come back."

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.916
But life as an artist
in New York was not easy,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.956
because I was broke,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.916
no money, no gallery agents,
no representation,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.556
so no gallery would show my work.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.716
So I thought to myself, I need to survive.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.460
So I started painting on clothes
to make a living.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:29.700
I started painting on shoes.

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.635
I started customizing things for people.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.356
And then soon I realized the power,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.036
because people were so proud
to wear their stories.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.996
So I started painting on everything.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.556
I painted on guitars,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.796
I started doing murals,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.876
anything I could find
my hand on I painted,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.716
and everything became my canvas.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.036
So one day, I was just going
on my Instagram feed,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.516
and I saw this picture.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.636
It was Reign. She took a picture
standing in front my art,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.396
and the moment I saw that photo,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.076
something happened in that moment.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.516
I could actually see my artwork
go into her and come out of her literally,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.900
and that's how I started painting
on human bodies.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.596
As a child I saw art on the marble floors,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.236
I saw art on walls,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.980
but now I see art on people's faces
and people's bodies.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.020
I remember my grandmother,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.636
and I realized that
most of my creative instincts

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.740
were actually based
on my childhood memories

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.540
and the art on my grandmother's skin.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.356
Now I look at all the people I painted,
and I think to myself, like,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.596
what would it look like
if we all walked around

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.796
like gods and goddesses
from Yoruba mythology?

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.596
And boom, that's how
The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.116
You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.196
means your soul, it means your essence,
it means your instincts.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.716
And I realized that only
when you tap into your Ori,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.276
then you can actually move mountains.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.060
So there's something so immediate
about painting on human bodies.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.276
It's like art in motion.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.356
It's like a 3D experience.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.156
So one day, I was just doing
my regular work in Brooklyn,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.876
and I got an email that said,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.196
"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.236
Would you like to paint
for my music video?

00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:08.517
Signed, Beyoncé."

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.996
Like, Beyoncé emailed me.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.356
I was like, what?

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.036
(Laughter)

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.116
I was like, what,
how did she even know me?

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.156
I thought this can't be true.
Of course I thought it was a scam.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.796
The Nigerian in me was like, nah.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.036
(Laughter)

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.196
(Applause)

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.676
But incredibly enough,
it was real, it was true,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.276
and things happened really fast.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.796
You see, Beyoncé wanted
to pay homage to New Orleans,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.076
and my art reminded her
of her creole origins.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.436
So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.300
boom, everything just went
from zero to 100 real fast.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.396
People featured me in magazines,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.636
interviews.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.236
People stopped me in the street.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.716
People knew my name, like --

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.316
And sometimes I had to step back

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.396
and just chill,
and, like, take everything in.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.836
You know, as artists,
we work so hard all our lives

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.276
for our art to be recognized,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.660
and for this I feel blessed.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.116
However, the attorney
in me is still there,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.820
so I use my art
to fight for what I believe in.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.100
My Yoruba heritage is always there.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.556
I'd like to share with you tonight
some of my art in motion.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.916
Please, welcome with me on stage.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.676
(Music)

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.940
(Applause)

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.596
Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.916
These are the first two people
I ever painted in my life,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.220
and I spent the past day painting on them.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.860
Tonight, they represent
my hopes and my fears.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.980
Now, I put my fears on the back.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.420
I put my hopes in front.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.940
What are my hopes?

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.516
I hope that people know

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.756
that Africa is not just
one huge, nameless continent

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.356
that is all the same.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.756
I also hope that people know

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.756
that in Nigeria, we have
over 350 ethnic groups and languages,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.900
and I am just one artist from one of them.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.196
(Applause)

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.196
I also hope that you know
that I hope I will be able to change

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.196
the way people talk about African art
on the continent and here,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.956
and I hope you know that African art

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.476
is not just what you buy
at Harlem markets in New York

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.356
and that every piece of art
you see has a story,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.996
and every artist has a name.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.236
Thank you very much.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:42.700
(Applause)
