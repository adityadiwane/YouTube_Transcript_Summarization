00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.136
In July of 1911,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.416
a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor
set out from his rainforest camp

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.056
with his team.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.216
After climbing a steep hill

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.656
and wiping the sweat from his brow,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.976
he described what he saw beneath him.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.176
He saw rising from
the dense rainforest foliage

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.776
this incredible interlocking
maze of structures

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.096
built of granite,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.336
beautifully put together.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.976
What's amazing about this project

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.976
is that it was the first funded
by National Geographic,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.920
and it graced the front cover
of its magazine in 1912.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.776
This professor used state-of-the-art
photography equipment

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.456
to record the site,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.976
forever changing the face of exploration.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.936
The site was Machu Picchu,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.256
When he saw the site, he asked,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.200
"This is an impossible dream.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.480
What could it be?"

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.696
So today,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.256
100 years later,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.496
I invite you all
on an incredible journey with me,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.416
a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.576
(Cheers)

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.016
We will do nothing less
than use state-of-the-art technology

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.960
to map an entire country.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.696
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.136
but we are expanding it to the world,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.296
making archaeological exploration
more open, inclusive,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.240
and at a scale simply
not previously possible.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.016
This is why I am so excited

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.136
to share with you all today

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.416
that we will begin
the 2016 TED Prize platform

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.720
in Latin America,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.400
more specifically Peru.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.256
(Applause)

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.640
Thank you.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.496
We will be taking
Hiram Bingham's impossible dream

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.735
and turning it into an amazing future

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.616
that we can all share in together.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.536
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.536
It has absolutely stunning jewelry,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.376
like what you can see here.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.416
It has amazing Moche pottery
of human figures.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.256
It has the Nazca Lines

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.240
and amazing textiles.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.656
So as part of the TED Prize platform,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.736
we are going to partnering
with some incredible organizations,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.216
first of all with DigitalGlobe,
the world's largest provider

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.336
of high-resolution
commercial satellite imagery.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.856
They're going to be helping us build out

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.056
this amazing crowdsourcing
platform they have.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.376
Maybe some of you used it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.656
with the MH370 crash
and search for the airplane.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.856
Of course, they'll also be providing us
with the satellite imagery.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.696
National Geographic will be helping us
with education and of course exploration.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.136
As well, they'll be providing us
with rich content for the platform,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.136
including some of the archival imagery
like you saw at the beginning of this talk

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.696
and some of their documentary footage.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.136
We've already begun
to build and plan the platform,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.416
and I'm just so excited.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.896
So here's the cool part.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.496
My team, headed up by Chase Childs,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.936
is already beginning to look
at some of the satellite imagery.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.176
Of course, what you can see here
is 0.3-meter data.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.416
This is site called Chan Chan
in northern Peru.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.416
It dates to 850 AD.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.816
It's a really amazing city,
but let's zoom in.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.216
This is the type and quality of data
that you all will get to see.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.256
You can see individual structures,
individual buildings.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.656
And we've already begun
to find previously unknown sites.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.336
What we can say already
is that as part of the platform,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.976
you will all help discover
thousands of previously unknown sites,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.496
like this one here,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.816
and this potentially large one here.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.296
Unfortunately, we've also begun
to uncover large-scale looting at sites,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.576
like what you see here.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.616
So many sites in Peru are threatened,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.696
but the great part
is that all of this data

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.736
is going to be shared
with archaeologists on the front lines

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.080
of protecting these sites.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.696
So I was just in Peru,
meeting with their Minister of Culture

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.976
as well as UNESCO.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.176
We'll be collaborating closely with them.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.456
Just so you all know,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.216
the site is going to be
in both English and Spanish,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.255
which is absolutely essential to make sure

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.216
that people in Peru and across
Latin America can participate.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.296
Our main project coprincipal investigator
is the gentleman you see here,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.376
Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.696
professor at Catholic University.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.736
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist
and former vice-minister,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.896
Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate
and share the data with archaeologists

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.256
so they can explore
these sites on the ground.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.656
He also runs this amazing
drone mapping program,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.736
some of the images of which
you can see behind me here and here.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.576
And this data will be incorporated
into the platform,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.934
and also he'll be helping to image
some of the new sites you help find.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.376
Our on-the-ground partner

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.576
who will be helping us
with education, outreach,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.505
as well as site preservation components,

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.529
is the Sustainable
Preservation Initiative,

00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:19.296
led by Dr. Larry Coben.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.696
Some of you may not be aware

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.816
that some of the world's
poorest communities

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.656
coexist with some of the world's
most well-known archaeological sites.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.136
What SPI does

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.136
is it helps to empower these communities,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.936
in particular women,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.056
with new economic approaches
and business training.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.496
So it helps to teach them
to create beautiful handicrafts

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.496
which are then sold on to tourists.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.696
This empowers the women
to treasure their cultural heritage

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.376
and take ownership of it.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.336
I had the opportunity to spend some time
with 24 of these women

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.976
at a well-known archaeological site
called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.416
These women were unbelievably inspiring,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.576
and what's great is that SPI
will help us transform communities

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.000
near some of the sites
that you help to discover.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.936
Peru is just the beginning.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.576
We're going to be expanding
this platform to the world,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.816
but already I've gotten
thousands of emails

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.496
from people all across the world --
professors, educators, students,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.056
and other archaeologists --
who are so excited to help participate.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.696
In fact, they're already suggesting
amazing places for us to help discover,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.576
including Atlantis.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.216
I don't know if we're going
to be looking for Atlantis,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.456
but you never know.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.576
So I'm just so excited
to launch this platform.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.376
It's going to be launched formally
by the end of the year.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.736
And I have to say,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.616
if what my team has already discovered
in the past few weeks are any indication,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.056
what the world discovers
is just going to be beyond imagination.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.136
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.496
Thank you very much.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.336
(Applause)

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.576
Thank you.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.800
(Applause)
