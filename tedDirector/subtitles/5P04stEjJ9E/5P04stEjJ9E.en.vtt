00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:15.046
I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.652
because I didn't join the Army

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:18.800
because I wanted to go to war.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.518
I didn't join the Army because I had a lust

00:00:21.518 --> 00:00:25.175
or a need to go overseas and fight.

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:27.515
Frankly, I joined the Army because

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:29.242
college is really damn expensive,

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:30.951
and they were going to help with that,

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:33.291
and I joined the Army because

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.447
it was what I knew,

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:38.309
and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.707
I didn't come from a military family.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.950
I'm not a military brat.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.729
No one in my family ever
had joined the military at all,

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.015
and how I first got introduced to the military

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.110
was when I was 13 years old

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.789
and I got sent away to military school,

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.458
because my mother had been threatening me

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.564
with this idea of military school
ever since I was eight years old.

00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:59.631
I had some issues when I was coming up,

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:01.659
and my mother would always tell me, she's like,

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.105
"You know, if you don't get this together,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.371
I'm going to send you to military school."

00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:05.931
And I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.863
I'll work harder."

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:09.347
And then when I was nine years old,

00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:11.575
she started giving me brochures
to show me she wasn't playing around,

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:12.870
so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.197
"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're
serious, and I'll work harder."

00:01:15.197 --> 00:01:17.349
And then when I was 10 and 11,

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.503
my behavior just kept on getting worse.

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:22.870
I was on academic and disciplinary probation

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.601
before I hit double digits,

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.543
and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists

00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:31.491
when I was 11 years old.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.107
And so when I was 13 years old,

00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:35.121
my mother came up to me, and she was like,

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.857
"I'm not going to do this anymore.

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:38.403
I'm going to send you to military school."

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:40.241
And I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,

00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.381
I can see you're upset, and
I'm going to work harder."

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.476
And she was like, "No, you're going next week."

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:47.881
And that was how I first got introduced

00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.471
to this whole idea of the military,

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.367
because she thought this was a good idea.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:55.179
I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.479
when I first showed up there,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.279
because literally in the first four days,

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.447
I had already run away five times from this school.

00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:02.333
They had these big black gates
that surrounded the school,

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.423
and every time they would turn their backs,

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.879
I would just simply run out of the black gates

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.741
and take them up on their offer
that if we don't want to be there,

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.171
we can leave at any time.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.864
So I just said, "Well, if that's the case,

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:15.112
then I'd like to leave." (Laughter)

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:17.223
And it never worked.

00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:19.397
And I kept on getting lost.

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:20.579
But then eventually,

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.109
after staying there for a little while,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.511
and after the end of that first year

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.359
at this military school,

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.015
I realized that I actually was growing up.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:34.539
I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.887
and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure

00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:39.634
was something that I'd never found before:

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.503
the fact that I finally felt like I
was part of something bigger,

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:44.953
part of a team, and it actually mattered to people

00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:46.665
that I was there,

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.855
the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:53.131
but that it was a real, actually core part

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.280
of the entire experience.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.404
And so when it was time for me to actually

00:02:57.404 --> 00:02:59.448
finish up high school,

00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:02.116
I started thinking about what I wanted to do,

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:03.920
and just like probably most students,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.314
had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.

00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:09.009
And I thought about the people who I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.298
respected and admired.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:12.984
I thought about a lot of the people,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.803
in particular a lot of the men, in my life

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:17.732
who I looked up to.

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.607
They all happened to wear the uniform

00:03:19.607 --> 00:03:21.546
of the United States of America,

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:23.791
so for me, the question and the answer

00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:25.858
really became pretty easy.

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:27.606
The question of what I wanted to do

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.244
was filled in very quickly with saying,

00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:32.443
I guess I'll be an Army officer.

00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:34.267
So the Army then went through this process

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:35.468
and they trained me up,

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:36.870
and when I say I didn't join the Army

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.500
because I wanted to go to war,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.583
the truth is, I joined in 1996.

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:43.353
There really wasn't a whole lot going on.

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:45.419
I didn't ever feel like I was in danger.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.542
When I went to my mom,

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.155
I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:49.864
so I literally needed parental permission

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:50.947
to join the Army,

00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:52.427
so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.420
and she just assumed it was
kind of like military school.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.724
She was like, "Well, it was good for him before,

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:58.107
so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"

00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:00.908
having no idea that the
paperwork that she was signing

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.940
was actually signing her son up

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.138
to become an Army officer.

00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:07.912
And I went through the process,

00:04:07.912 --> 00:04:09.706
and again the whole time still just thinking,

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:13.529
this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:18.643
or two weeks during the year, do drill,

00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:21.359
and then a couple years after I signed up,

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.945
a couple years after my mother signed those papers,

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:27.671
the whole world changed.

00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.875
And after 9/11, there was an entirely new context

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:34.865
about the occupation that I chose.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:39.430
When I first joined, I never joined to fight,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.100
but now that I was in,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.887
this is exactly what was now going to happen.

00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:48.234
And I thought about so much about the soldiers

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:50.091
who I eventually had to end up leading.

00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:52.601
I remember when we first, right after 9/11,

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.224
three weeks after 9/11, I was
on a plane heading overseas,

00:04:55.224 --> 00:04:57.210
but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.245
I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship

00:04:59.245 --> 00:05:00.566
to go overseas.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.416
I received the scholarship to go overseas

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.716
and to go study and live overseas,

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:06.788
and I was living in England and that was interesting,

00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:08.254
but at the same time, the same people who

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:10.998
I was training with,

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.411
the same soldiers that I went
through all my training with,

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.600
and we prepared for war,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.086
they were now actually heading over to it.

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:20.967
They were now about to find themselves

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:23.151
in the middle of places the fact is

00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:24.719
the vast majority of people,

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.985
the vast majority of us as we were training,

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:30.924
couldn't even point out on a map.

00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:32.690
I spent a couple years finishing graduate school,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.950
and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.536
in buildings at Oxford

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.910
that were literally built hundreds of years

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.758
before the United States was even founded,

00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.930
and I'm sitting there talking to dons

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.894
about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,

00:05:47.894 --> 00:05:52.216
and how that influenced the start of World War I,

00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:54.460
where the entire time my heart and my head

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.344
were on my soldiers

00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:59.314
who were now throwing on Kevlars

00:05:59.314 --> 00:06:00.750
and grabbing their flak vests

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.298
and figuring out how exactly do I change around

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:05.590
or how exactly do I clean a machine gun

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.638
in the darkness.

00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:11.571
That was the new reality.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.944
By the time I finished that up and I rejoined

00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:16.634
my military unit and we were getting
ready to deploy to Afghanistan,

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.222
there were soldiers in my unit who were now

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:20.320
on their second and third deployments

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.740
before I even had my first.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.728
I remember walking out with
my unit for the first time,

00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:25.092
and when you join the Army

00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:26.748
and you go through a combat tour,

00:06:26.748 --> 00:06:28.082
everyone looks at your shoulder,

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:31.860
because on your shoulder is your combat patch.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.136
And so immediately as you meet people,

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.552
you shake their hand,

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:36.411
and then your eyes go to their shoulder,

00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:38.024
because you want to see where did they serve,

00:06:38.024 --> 00:06:39.330
or what unit did they serve with?

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.024
And I was the only person walking around

00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:43.314
with a bare shoulder,

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:47.404
and it burned every time someone stared at it.

00:06:47.404 --> 00:06:50.412
But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:54.190
and you ask them why did they sign up.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.279
I signed up because college was expensive.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.700
A lot of my soldiers signed up
for completely different reasons.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.632
They signed up because of a sense of obligation.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.441
They signed up because they were angry

00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.258
and they wanted to do something about it.

00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:09.570
They signed up because

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.416
their family said this was important.

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:13.628
They signed up because they
wanted some form of revenge.

00:07:13.628 --> 00:07:18.276
They signed for a whole
collection of different reasons.

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:21.044
And now we all found ourselves overseas

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:24.945
fighting in these conflicts.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.456
And what was amazing to me was that I

00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:31.778
very naively started hearing this statement

00:07:31.778 --> 00:07:35.044
that I never fully understood,

00:07:35.044 --> 00:07:37.402
because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea

00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:38.759
where people come up to you and they say,

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.396
"Well, thank you for your service."

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:43.359
And I just kind of followed in and started saying

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.994
the same things to all my soldiers.

00:07:44.994 --> 00:07:46.575
This is even before I deployed.

00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:50.070
But I really had no idea what that even meant.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.074
I just said it because it sounded right.

00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:53.850
I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.494
to people who had served overseas.

00:07:55.494 --> 00:07:57.924
"Thank you for your service."

00:07:57.924 --> 00:07:59.940
But I had no idea what the context was

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.270
or what that even,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.840
what it even meant to the people who heard it.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.626
When I first came back from Afghanistan,

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:14.100
I thought that if you make it back from conflict,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.941
then the dangers were all over.

00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:20.138
I thought that if you made it
back from a conflict zone

00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:22.437
that somehow you could kind of

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:23.671
wipe the sweat off your brow and say,

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:27.415
"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"

00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:29.223
without understanding that for so many people,

00:08:29.223 --> 00:08:31.366
as they come back home,

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:33.665
the war keeps going.

00:08:33.665 --> 00:08:35.919
It keeps playing out in all of our minds.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.557
It plays out in all of our memories.

00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:43.220
It plays out in all of our emotions.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.557
Please forgive us

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:49.767
if we don't like being in big crowds.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:52.030
Please forgive us

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.354
when we spend one week in a place

00:08:54.354 --> 00:08:56.702
that has 100 percent light discipline,

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.930
because you're not allowed to
walk around with white lights,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.417
because if anything has a white light,

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:01.894
it can be seen from miles away,

00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:03.607
versus if you use little green

00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:04.774
or little blue lights,

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:06.706
they cannot be seen from far away.

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:08.839
So please forgive us if out of nowhere,

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:12.046
we go from having 100 percent light discipline

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:14.599
to then a week later being back
in the middle of Times Square,

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:19.730
and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.162
Please forgive us

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:23.001
when you transition back to a family

00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:27.105
who has completely been maneuvering without you,

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:29.132
and now when you come back, it's not that easy

00:09:29.132 --> 00:09:32.776
to fall back into a sense of normality,

00:09:32.776 --> 00:09:37.258
because the whole normal has changed.

00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:40.820
I remember when I came back,
I wanted to talk to people.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.579
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.

00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:45.327
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:46.642
"What did you do?"

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:48.129
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.747
"What was it like? What was the food like?

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:54.272
What was the experience like? How are you doing?"

00:09:54.272 --> 00:09:56.333
And the only questions I got from people was,

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:59.064
"Did you shoot anybody?"

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:00.890
And those were the ones who were even curious

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.548
enough to say anything.

00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:06.218
Because sometimes there's this fear

00:10:06.218 --> 00:10:07.783
and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,

00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:09.259
I'm afraid I'll offend,

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:10.633
or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:15.291
so the common default is just saying nothing.

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.890
The problem with that

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.496
is then it feels like your service

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:22.010
was not even acknowledged,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.017
like no one even cared.

00:10:25.017 --> 00:10:28.040
"Thank you for your service,"

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.133
and we move on.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:33.809
What I wanted to better understand

00:10:33.809 --> 00:10:37.123
was what's behind that,

00:10:37.123 --> 00:10:42.875
and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:46.491
The fact is, we have literally

00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:49.048
2.6 million men and women

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.972
who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan

00:10:51.972 --> 00:10:54.642
who are all amongst us.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.122
Sometimes we know who they are,

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.234
sometimes we don't,

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:01.401
but there is that feeling, the shared experience,

00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:04.325
the shared bond

00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:06.197
where we know that that experience

00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:08.206
and that chapter of our life,

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:10.921
while it might be closed,

00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.967
it's still not over.

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.596
We think about "thank you for your service,"

00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:18.665
and people say, "So what does 'thank
you for your service' mean to you?"

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.345
Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me,

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:24.423
it means acknowledging our stories,

00:11:24.423 --> 00:11:27.289
asking us who we are,

00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:29.702
understanding the strength

00:11:29.702 --> 00:11:33.932
that so many people, so many
people who we serve with, have,

00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:37.652
and why that service means so much.

00:11:37.652 --> 00:11:39.786
"Thank you for your service"
means acknowledging the fact

00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:41.604
that just because we've now come home

00:11:41.604 --> 00:11:42.895
and we've taken off the uniform

00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:45.175
does not mean our larger service to this country

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.851
is somehow over.

00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:50.732
The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:54.922
that can be offered and can be given.

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.352
When I look at people

00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:01.010
like our friend Taylor Urruela,

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.754
who in Iraq loses his leg,

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:05.412
had two big dreams in his life.

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:08.480
One was to be a soldier. The other
was to be a baseball player.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.280
He loses his leg in Iraq.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.904
He comes back

00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:16.598
and instead of deciding that,

00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:19.016
well, now since I've lost my
leg, that second dream is over,

00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:21.430
he decides that he still has that
dream of playing baseball,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.402
and he starts this group called VETSports,

00:12:23.402 --> 00:12:25.313
which now works with veterans all over the country

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:30.648
and uses sports as a way of healing.

00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:32.991
People like Tammy Duckworth,

00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:34.239
who was a helicopter pilot

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:36.105
and with the helicopter that she was flying,

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:37.644
you need to use both your hands

00:12:37.644 --> 00:12:39.175
and also your legs to steer,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.644
and her helicopter gets hit,

00:12:40.644 --> 00:12:41.906
and she's trying to steer the chopper,

00:12:41.906 --> 00:12:43.823
but the chopper's not reacting

00:12:43.823 --> 00:12:45.504
to her instructions and to her commands.

00:12:45.504 --> 00:12:48.015
She's trying to land the chopper safely,

00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:49.656
but the chopper doesn't land safely,

00:12:49.656 --> 00:12:50.768
and the reason it's not landing safely

00:12:50.768 --> 00:12:53.441
is because it's not responding to the
commands that her legs are giving

00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:58.289
because her legs were blown off.

00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:01.194
She barely survives.

00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:05.100
Medics come and they save her life,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.561
but then as she's doing her
recuperation back at home,

00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:11.871
she realizes that, "My job's still not done."

00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:13.355
And now she uses her voice

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.547
as a Congresswoman from Illinois

00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:18.505
to fight and advocate for a collection of issues

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:22.370
to include veterans issues.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.096
We signed up because

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:29.566
we love this country we represent.

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:31.910
We signed up because

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.468
we believe in the idea and we believe in the people

00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:37.256
to our left and to our right.

00:13:37.256 --> 00:13:39.168
And the only thing we then ask is that

00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:41.430
"thank you for your service"

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.554
needs to be more than just a quote break,

00:13:44.554 --> 00:13:47.180
that "thank you for your service" means

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.406
honestly digging in

00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:52.356
to the people who have stepped up

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:56.199
simply because they were asked to,

00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:58.228
and what that means for us not just now,

00:13:58.228 --> 00:14:01.720
not just during combat operations,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.069
but long after the last vehicle has left

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:09.943
and after the last shot has been taken.

00:14:09.943 --> 00:14:12.773
These are the people who I served with,

00:14:12.773 --> 00:14:16.477
and these are the people who I honor.

00:14:16.477 --> 00:14:18.648
So thank you for your service.

00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:22.500
(Applause)
