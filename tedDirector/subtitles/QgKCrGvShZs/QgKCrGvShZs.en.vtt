00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:23.829
So, as researchers, something
that we often do is use immense resources

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:27.132
to achieve certain capabilities,
or achieve certain goals.

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.691
And this is essential
to the progress of science,

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.040
or exploration of what is possible.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.072
But it creates this unfortunate situation

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:36.112
where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.232
can actually participate
in this exploration

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:40.077
or can benefit from that technology.

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:41.506
Something that motivates me,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.743
and gets me really excited
about my research,

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.473
is when I see simple opportunities

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:49.297
to drastically change that distribution
and make the technology accessible

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.430
to a much wider percentage
of the population.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:54.986
I'm going to show you two videos
that have gotten a lot of attention

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.780
that I think embody this philosophy.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:59.237
And they actually use
the Nintendo Wii Remote.

00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.802
For those of you who aren't
familiar with this device,

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.523
it's a $40 video game controller.

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:07.692
And it's mostly advertised
for its motion-sensing capabilities:

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:10.358
so you can swing a tennis racket,
or hit a baseball bat.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.740
But what actually interests me a lot more

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.922
is the fact that in the tip
of each controller

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:17.736
is a relatively high-performing
infrared camera.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.219
And I'm going to show you
two demos of why this is useful.

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.147
So here, I have my computer
set up with the projector,

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.528
and I have a Wii Remote
sitting on top of it.

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:31.410
And, for example, if you're in a school
that doesn't have a lot money,

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:32.861
probably a lot of schools,

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:36.567
or if you're in an office environment,
and you want an interactive whiteboard,

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:39.241
normally these cost
about two to three thousand dollars.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:43.015
So I'm going to show you
how to create one with a Wii Remote.

00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:46.981
Now, this requires
another piece of hardware,

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:48.573
which is this infrared pen.

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:51.407
You can probably make
this yourself for about five dollars

00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:53.263
with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:55.845
It's got a battery,
a button and an infrared LED --

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.027
you guys can't see it --

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:59.282
but it turns on
whenever I push the button.

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:03.844
Now, what this means is
that if I run this piece of software,

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:08.281
the camera sees the infrared dot,

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:12.490
and I can register the location
of the camera pixels

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:13.657
to the projector pixels.

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.363
And now this is like
an interactive whiteboard surface.

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:18.109
(Applause)

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:22.022
So for about $50 of hardware,
you can have your own whiteboard.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.229
This is Adobe Photoshop.

00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:29.918
(Applause)

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:30.998
Thank you.

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:32.655
(Laughter)

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.290
The software for this
I've actually put on my website

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:37.321
and have let people download it for free.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.716
In the three months
this project has been public,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.008
it's been downloaded
over half a million times.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.273
So teachers and students
all around the world

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.643
are already using this.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:51.066
(Applause)

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.383
Although it does do it for 50 dollars,

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.464
there are some limitations
of this approach.

00:02:55.488 --> 00:02:58.890
You get about 80 percent of the way there,
for one percent of the cost.

00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:01.692
Another nice thing is that a camera
can see multiple dots,

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:05.179
so this is actually a multi-touch,
interactive whiteboard system as well.

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:07.401
(Applause)

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:08.553
For the second demo,

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.201
I have this Wii Remote
that's actually next to the TV.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.425
So it's pointing away from the display,
rather than pointing at the display.

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.712
And why this is interesting

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:21.450
is that if you put on, say,
a pair of safety glasses,

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:23.288
that have two infrared dots in them,

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:28.565
they are going to give the computer
an approximation of your head location.

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:29.891
And why this is interesting

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:33.058
is I have this sort of application
running on the computer monitor,

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.614
which has a 3D room,
with some targets floating in it.

00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:37.877
And you can see that it
looks like a 3D room.

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.248
kind of like a video game,
it sort of looks 3D,

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:43.739
but for the most part,
the image looks pretty flat,

00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:45.621
and bound to the surface of the screen.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.745
But if we turn on head tracking --

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.835
the computer can change
the image that's on the screen

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.875
and make it respond to the head movements.

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.280
So let's switch back to that.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:00.306
(Laughter)

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.194
(Applause)

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:14.194
So this has actually
been a little bit startling

00:04:14.218 --> 00:04:15.852
to the game-development community.

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:17.698
(Laughter)

00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:20.578
Because this is about 10 dollars
of additional hardware

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:22.461
if you already have a Nintendo Wii.

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:24.770
So I'm looking forward
to seeing some games,

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:27.289
and actually Louis Castle,
that's him down there,

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:30.952
last week announced that Electronic Arts,
one of the largest game publishers,

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.977
is releasing a game in May
that has a little Easter egg feature

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.294
for supporting this type of head tracking.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:38.244
And that's from less than five months

00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:41.394
from a prototype in my lab
to a major commercial product.

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:46.911
(Applause)

00:04:46.935 --> 00:04:48.164
Thank you.

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.427
(Applause)

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:52.850
But actually, to me,
what's almost more interesting

00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:54.446
than either of these two projects

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.765
is how people actually
found out about them.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.329
YouTube has really changed the way,
or changed the speed,

00:05:00.353 --> 00:05:01.687
in which a single individual

00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:03.938
can actually spread
an idea around the world.

00:05:03.962 --> 00:05:06.962
I'm doing some research
in my lab with a video camera,

00:05:06.986 --> 00:05:09.939
and within the first week,
a million people had seen this work,

00:05:09.963 --> 00:05:13.554
and literally within days,
engineers, teachers and students

00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:16.769
from around the world were already
posting their own YouTube videos

00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:20.153
of them using my system
or derivatives of this work.

00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:22.717
So I hope to see more
of that in the future,

00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:26.313
and hope online video distribution
to be embraced by the research community.

00:05:26.337 --> 00:05:27.590
So thank you very much.

00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:31.103
(Applause)
