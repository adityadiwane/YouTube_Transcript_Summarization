00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.045
My talk today is about something

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:21.378
maybe a couple of you have already heard about.

00:00:21.378 --> 00:00:23.712
It's called the Arab Spring.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:25.610
Anyone heard of it?

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.735
(Applause)

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:33.480
So in 2011, power shifted,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.123
from the few to the many,

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:39.878
from oval offices to central squares,

00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:42.871
from carefully guarded airwaves

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.558
to open-source networks.

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:50.342
But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.326
there were representative surveys

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:55.316
already giving people a voice

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:58.809
in quieter but still powerful ways.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.641
I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.

00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:06.125
Since 2001,

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.506
we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people --

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:11.281
young and old, men and women,

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.421
educated and illiterate.

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.924
My talk today draws on this research

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:20.857
to reveal why Arabs rose up

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:23.874
and what they want now.

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:27.056
Now this region's very diverse,

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.041
and every country is unique.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:30.691
But those who revolted

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.630
shared a common set of grievances

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.807
and have similar demands today.

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:39.658
I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:43.024
It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.

00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:46.608
But it's the largest Arab country

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:50.023
and it's also one with a great deal of influence.

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:54.007
But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.824
to look at the mundane topics

00:01:56.824 --> 00:01:59.607
of Arab views of religion and politics

00:01:59.607 --> 00:02:02.792
and how this impacts women,

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:06.564
revealing some surprises along the way.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:10.693
So after analyzing mounds of data,

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.161
what we discovered was this:

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.400
Unemployment and poverty alone

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.994
did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:24.077
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.795
sparked these revolutions,

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:29.795
it was the difference between what Arabs experienced

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.175
and what they expected

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:34.008
that provided the fuel.

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.409
To tell you what I mean,

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.591
consider this trend in Egypt.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.567
On paper the country was doing great.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:43.424
In fact, it attracted accolades

00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:45.876
from multinational organizations

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:47.942
because of its economic growth.

00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:50.591
But under the surface was a very different reality.

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.341
In 2010, right before the revolution,

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.492
even though GDP per capita

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.591
had been growing at five percent for several years,

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:04.091
Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.

00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.359
Now this is very unusual,

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.660
because globally we find that, not surprisingly,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.275
people feel better as their country gets richer.

00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:16.058
And that's because they have better job opportunities

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:19.471
and their state offers better social services.

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:21.859
But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.591
As the country got more well-off,

00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:27.009
unemployment actually rose

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.659
and people's satisfaction

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.596
with things like housing and education plummeted.

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:39.886
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:47.260
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.526
Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory,

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:55.062
Arabs didn't despise Western liberty,

00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:57.014
they desired it.

00:03:57.014 --> 00:03:59.763
As early as 2001,

00:03:59.763 --> 00:04:03.236
we asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:06.165
what they admired most about the West.

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:08.832
Among the most frequent responses

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.184
was liberty and justice.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.350
In their own words to an open-ended question

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.266
we heard, "Their political system is transparent

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:20.467
and it's following democracy in its true sense."

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:22.466
Another said it was "liberty and freedom

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.198
and being open-minded with each other."

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:29.833
Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.251
in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:34.934
told us in 2005

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:39.133
that if they were to write a new constitution

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.499
for a theoretical new country

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.824
that they would guarantee freedom of speech

00:04:44.824 --> 00:04:47.234
as a fundamental right,

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:49.318
especially in Egypt.

00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:53.300
Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.866
would help Muslims progress --

00:04:55.866 --> 00:05:00.083
the highest percentage of any country we surveyed.

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:03.783
But pressed up against these democratic aspirations

00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:06.884
was a very different day-to-day experience,

00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:09.050
especially in Egypt.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.568
While aspiring to democracy the most,

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:17.315
they were the least likely population in the world

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:21.042
to say that they had actually voiced their opinion

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.416
to a public official in the last month --

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:27.099
at only four percent.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.867
So while economic development made a few people rich,

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:34.865
it left many more worse off.

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:38.451
As people felt less and less free,

00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:42.200
they also felt less and less provided for.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.950
So rather than viewing their former regimes

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.384
as generous if overprotective fathers,

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:53.585
they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:58.001
So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,

00:05:58.001 --> 00:06:00.168
they potentially could be

00:06:00.168 --> 00:06:02.834
an example for the region.

00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:04.556
If Egypt is to succeed

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:08.023
at building a society based on the rule of law,

00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:10.875
it could be a model.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.200
If, however,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.624
the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:20.334
the consequences could be catastrophic --

00:06:20.334 --> 00:06:21.568
not just for Egypt,

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.840
but for the entire region.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.468
The signs don't look good, some have said.

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:33.301
Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:35.900
won the majority in Parliament.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.571
The military council

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:41.886
has cracked down on civil society and protests

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:45.254
and the country's economy continues to suffer.

00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:50.019
Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.647
ignores the real revolution.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.826
Because Egyptians are more optimistic

00:06:56.826 --> 00:06:59.273
than they have been in years,

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:03.045
far less divided on religious-secular lines

00:07:03.045 --> 00:07:04.361
than we would think

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:08.276
and poised for the demands of democracy.

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:11.227
Whether they support Islamists or liberals,

00:07:11.227 --> 00:07:14.571
Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical,

00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.327
and they are jobs, stability and education,

00:07:17.327 --> 00:07:19.660
not moral policing.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.728
But most of all,

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:22.159
for the first time in decades,

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:25.909
they expect to be active participants, not spectators,

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.210
in the affairs of their country.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.226
I was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians

00:07:32.226 --> 00:07:33.761
from Egypt and Tunisia

00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:35.293
a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:35.293 --> 00:07:38.071
And what really struck me about them

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:43.260
was that they weren't only optimistic,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.102
but they kind of struck me as nervous,

00:07:46.102 --> 00:07:47.453
for lack of a better word.

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:48.742
One said to me,

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:51.665
"Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" --

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:54.682
or soccer, as we say in America --

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:59.065
"and now they gather to watch Parliament."

00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:02.419
(Laughter)

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.641
"They're really watching us,

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.628
and we can't help but worry

00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:11.148
that we're not going to live up to their expectations."

00:08:11.148 --> 00:08:12.656
And what really struck me

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:14.848
is that less than 24 months ago,

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:17.099
it was the people that were nervous

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:20.181
about being watched by their government.

00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.031
And the reason that they're expecting a lot

00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.635
is because they have a new-found hope for the future.

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:28.421
So right before the revolution

00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:31.898
we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,

00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:36.198
but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.

00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:39.431
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak

00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:41.265
wasn't that life got easier.

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.372
It actually got harder.

00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:46.465
But people's expectations for their future

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.265
went up significantly.

00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:50.662
And this hope, this optimism,

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:55.008
endured a year of turbulent transition.

00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:58.536
One reason that there's this optimism

00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:02.267
is because, contrary to what many people have said,

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:06.449
most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:09.283
So while Egyptians were known

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:12.750
for their single-digit turnout

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.018
in elections before the revolution,

00:09:15.018 --> 00:09:18.850
the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout --

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.849
men and women.

00:09:20.849 --> 00:09:25.763
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 --

00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:27.444
I'm surprised it was a quarter --

00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:31.556
90 percent thought that this last election was honest.

00:09:31.556 --> 00:09:33.134
Now why this matters

00:09:33.134 --> 00:09:36.300
is because we discovered a link

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.534
between people's faith in their democratic process

00:09:40.534 --> 00:09:44.383
and their faith that oppressed people

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:46.900
can change their situation

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.620
through peaceful means alone.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:10:00.991
(Applause)

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.412
Now I know what some of you are thinking.

00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:05.045
The Egyptian people,

00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:08.895
and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,

00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:12.312
have very high expectations of the government.

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:17.110
They're just victims of a long-time autocracy,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.327
expecting a paternal state

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.706
to solve all their problems.

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:25.295
But this conclusion would ignore

00:10:25.295 --> 00:10:28.445
a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt

00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:32.461
far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.

00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:36.127
And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations

00:10:36.127 --> 00:10:39.494
are placed first on themselves.

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:43.661
In the country once known for its passive resignation,

00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.527
where, as bad as things got,

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:48.996
only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:52.308
today 90 percent tell us

00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:54.580
that if there's a problem in their community,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.013
it's up to them to fix it.

00:10:57.013 --> 00:11:04.706
(Applause)

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.509
And three-fourths

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:09.340
believe they not only have the responsibility,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.310
but the power to make change.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.574
And this empowerment

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.506
also applies to women,

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:19.177
whose role in the revolts

00:11:19.177 --> 00:11:21.328
cannot be underestimated.

00:11:21.328 --> 00:11:23.729
They were doctors and dissidents,

00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:25.295
artists and organizers.

00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:30.428
A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:35.463
to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt

00:11:35.463 --> 00:11:37.136
were women.

00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:42.779
(Applause)

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.468
Now people have raised some real concerns

00:11:45.468 --> 00:11:49.134
about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.

00:11:49.134 --> 00:11:53.418
What we've found about the role of religion in law

00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:55.934
and the role of religion in society

00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.920
is that there's no female consensus.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.103
We found that women in one country

00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:05.070
look more like the men in that country

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.734
than their female counterparts across the border.

00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:11.252
Now what this suggests

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:15.319
is that how women view religion's role in society

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:20.600
is shaped more by their own country's culture and context

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.115
than one monolithic view

00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.952
that religion is simply bad for women.

00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:29.717
Where women agree, however,

00:12:29.717 --> 00:12:31.300
is on their own role,

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.833
and that it must be central and active.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:38.951
And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country --

00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:41.701
on the issue of women's rights.

00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:44.301
Now how men feel about women's rights

00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:47.750
matters to the future of this region.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.784
Because we discovered a link

00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:53.786
between men's support for women's employment

00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:56.985
and how many women are actually employed

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.169
in professional fields in that country.

00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:01.633
So the question becomes,

00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:05.808
What drives men's support for women's rights?

00:13:05.808 --> 00:13:12.557
What about men's views of religion and law?

00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:15.442
[Does] a man's opinion

00:13:15.442 --> 00:13:18.327
of the role of religion in politics

00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:21.976
shape their view of women's rights?

00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:23.209
The answer is no.

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:26.094
We found absolutely no correlation,

00:13:26.094 --> 00:13:27.908
no impact whatsoever,

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.443
between these two variables.

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:34.159
What drives men's support for women's employment

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:37.043
is men's employment,

00:13:37.043 --> 00:13:39.542
their level of education

00:13:39.542 --> 00:13:42.327
as well as a high score

00:13:42.327 --> 00:13:46.426
on their country's U.N. Human Development Index.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.617
What this means

00:13:47.617 --> 00:13:50.691
is that human development,

00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:52.987
not secularization,

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:55.707
is what's key to women's empowerment

00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:59.391
in the transforming Middle East.

00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:02.340
And the transformation continues.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.223
From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,

00:14:06.223 --> 00:14:08.280
it has never been more important

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.624
to understand the aspirations

00:14:10.624 --> 00:14:12.742
of ordinary people.

00:14:12.742 --> 00:14:14.473
Thank you.

00:14:14.473 --> 00:14:24.659
(Applause)
