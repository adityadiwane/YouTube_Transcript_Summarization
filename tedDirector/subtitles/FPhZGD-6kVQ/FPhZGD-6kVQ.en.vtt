00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.136
Half of the human workforce
is expected to be replaced

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.880
by software and robots
in the next 20 years.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.680
And many corporate leaders welcome
that as a chance to increase profits.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.816
Machines are more efficient;

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.800
humans are complicated
and difficult to manage.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.176
Well, I want our organizations
to remain human.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.000
In fact, I want them to become beautiful.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.735
Because as machines take our jobs
and do them more efficiently,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:48.976
soon the only work left for us humans
will be the kind of work

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.080
that must be done beautifully
rather than efficiently.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.936
To maintain our humanity
in the this second Machine Age,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.960
we may have no other choice
than to create beauty.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.456
Beauty is an elusive concept.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.880
For the writer Stendhal
it was the promise of happiness.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.856
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.296
(Laughter)

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.896
So bear with me

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.296
as I am proposing four admittedly
very subjective principles

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.240
that you can use to build
a beautiful organization.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.496
First: do the unnecessary.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.736
[Do the Unnecessary]

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.296
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.456
the CEO and founder
of the yogurt company Chobani,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.040
made headlines when he decided to grant
stock to all of his 2,000 employees.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.536
Some called it a PR stunt,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.776
others -- a genuine act of giving back.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.480
But there is something else
that was remarkable about it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.056
It came completely out of the blue.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.696
There had been no market
or stakeholder pressure,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.696
and employees were so surprised

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200
that they burst into tears
when they heard the news.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.920
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful
because they catch us off guard.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.976
They create something out of nothing

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240
because they're completely unnecessary.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.096
I once worked at a company

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.696
that was the result of a merger

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.376
of a large IT outsourcing firm
and a small design firm.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.376
We were merging 9,000 software engineers

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160
with 1,000 creative types.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.536
And to unify these
immensely different cultures,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.616
we were going to launch
a third, new brand.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.136
And the new brand color
was going to be orange.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.576
And as we were going
through the budget for the rollouts,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.656
we decided last minute

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.336
to cut the purchase
of 10,000 orange balloons,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.160
which we had meant
to distribute to all staff worldwide.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.960
They just seemed
unnecessary and cute in the end.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.816
I didn't know back then

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.376
that our decision
marked the beginning of the end --

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.040
that these two organizations
would never become one.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.616
And sure enough,
the merger eventually failed.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.456
Now, was it because
there weren't any orange balloons?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.080
No, of course not.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.920
But the kill-the-orange-balloons
mentality permeated everything else.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.896
You might not always realize it,
but when you cut the unnecessary,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.400
you cut everything.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.800
Leading with beauty means
rising above what is merely necessary.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.920
So do not kill your orange balloons.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.696
The second principle:

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.056
create intimacy.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.456
[Create Intimacy]

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.296
Studies show that
how we feel about our workplace

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.040
very much depends on the relationships
with our coworkers.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.096
And what are relationships
other than a string of microinteractions?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.336
There are hundreds of these
every day in our organizations

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.640
that have the potential to distinguish
a good life from a beautiful one.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.456
The marriage researcher John Gottman says

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.096
that the secret of a healthy relationship

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.176
is not the great gesture
or the lofty promise,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.400
it's small moments of attachment.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.880
In other words, intimacy.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.656
In our networked organizations,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.296
we tout the strength of weak ties

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.176
but we underestimate
the strength of strong ones.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.096
We forget the words of the writer
Richard Bach who once said,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.336
"Intimacy --

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.576
not connectedness --

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.920
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280
So how do we design
for organizational intimacy?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.336
The humanitarian organization CARE

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.736
wanted to launch
a campaign on gender equality

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.240
in villages in northern India.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.376
But it realized quickly

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.360
that it had to have this conversation
first with its own staff.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.016
So it invited all 36 team members
and their partners

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.776
to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.560
known for their famous erotic sculptures.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.096
And there they openly discussed
their personal relationships --

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.680
their own experiences of gender equality

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.016
with the coworkers and the partners.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.336
It was eye-opening for the participants.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.376
Not only did it allow them
to relate to the communities they serve,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.936
it also broke down invisible barriers

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.176
and created a lasting bond
amongst themselves.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.960
Not a single team member
quit in the next four years.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.160
So this is how you create intimacy.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.080
No masks ...

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.536
or lots of masks.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.776
(Laughter)

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.256
When Danone, the food company,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.840
wanted to translate its new company
manifesto into product initiatives,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.696
it gathered the management team

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.336
and 100 employees
from across different departments,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.976
seniority levels and regions

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.120
for a three-day strategy retreat.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.256
And it asked everybody
to wear costumes for the entire meeting:

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.376
wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.800
huge glasses and so on.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.816
And they left with concrete outcomes

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.520
and full of enthusiasm.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.016
And when I asked the woman
who had designed this experience

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.256
why it worked,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.096
she simply said, "Never underestimate
the power of a ridiculous wig."

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.296
(Laughter)

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.680
(Applause)

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.056
Because wigs erase hierarchy,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.936
and hierarchy kills intimacy --

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.176
both ways,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.880
for the CEO and the intern.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.576
Wigs allow us to use
the disguise of the false

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.040
to show something true about ourselves.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.336
And that's not easy
in our everyday work lives,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.696
because the relationship
with our organizations

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.600
is often like that of a married couple
that has grown apart,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.256
suffered betrayals and disappointments,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.600
and is now desperate to be beautiful
for one another once again.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.360
And for either of us the first step
towards beauty involves a huge risk.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.736
The risk to be ugly.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.096
[Be Ugly]

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.376
So many organizations these days
are keen on designing beautiful workplaces

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.016
that look like anything but work:

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.056
vacation resorts, coffee shops,
playgrounds or college campuses --

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.296
(Laughter)

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.496
Based on the promises
of positive psychology,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.896
we speak of play and gamification,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.456
and one start-up even says
that when someone gets fired,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.776
they have graduated.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.776
(Laughter)

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.296
That kind of beautiful language
only goes "skin deep,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.560
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.456
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.000
To be authentic is to be ugly.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.216
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun
or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.640
but it does mean that you speak
the actual ugly truth.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.016
Like this manufacturer

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.776
that wanted to transform
one of its struggling business units.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.216
It identified, named and pinned
on large boards all the issues --

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.896
and there were hundreds of them --

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.216
that had become obstacles
to better performance.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.816
They put them on boards,
moved them all into one room,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.096
which they called "the ugly room."

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.496
The ugly became visible
for everyone to see --

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.336
it was celebrated.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.216
And the ugly room served as a mix
of mirror exhibition and operating room --

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.760
a biopsy on the living flesh
to cut out all the bureaucracy.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.840
The ugliest part of our body is our brain.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.176
Literally and neurologically.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.440
Our brain renders ugly
what is unfamiliar ...

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.416
modern art, atonal music,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.656
jazz, maybe --

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.376
VR goggles for that matter --

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.480
strange objects, sounds and people.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.496
But we've all been ugly once.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.200
We were a weird-looking baby,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.160
a new kid on the block, a foreigner.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.440
And we will be ugly again
when we don't belong.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.216
The Center for Political Beauty,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.856
an activist collective in Berlin,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.560
recently staged an extreme
artistic intervention.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.096
With the permission of relatives,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.256
it exhumed the corpses of refugees
who had drowned at Europe's borders,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.176
transported them all the way to Berlin,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.000
and then reburied them
at the heart of the German capital.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.096
The idea was to allow them
to reach their desired destination,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.760
if only after their death.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.976
Such acts of beautification
may not be pretty,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.256
but they are much needed.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.736
Because things tend to get ugly
when there's only one meaning, one truth,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.200
only answers and no questions.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880
Beautiful organizations
keep asking questions.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.600
They remain incomplete,

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:07.656
which is the fourth
and the last of the principles.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.216
[Remain Incomplete]

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.560
Recently I was in Paris,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.376
and a friend of mine
took me to Nuit Debout,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.936
which stands for "up all night,"

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.896
the self-organized protest movement

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.840
that had formed in response
to the proposed labor laws in France.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.896
Every night, hundreds gathered
at the Place de la République.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.496
Every night they set up
a small, temporary village

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.120
to deliberate their own vision
of the French Republic.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.776
And at the core of this adhocracy

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.056
was a general assembly
where anybody could speak

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.680
using a specially designed sign language.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.176
Like Occupy Wall Street
and other protest movements,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.096
Nuit Debout was born
in the face of crisis.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.576
It was messy --

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.920
full of controversies and contradictions.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.696
But whether you agreed
with the movement's goals or not,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.440
every gathering was
a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.656
And how fitting that Paris --

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.456
the city of ideals, the city of beauty --

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.696
was it's stage.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.536
It reminds us that like great cities,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.736
the most beautiful organizations
are ideas worth fighting for --

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.800
even and especially
when their outcome is uncertain.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.776
They are movements;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.136
they are always imperfect,
never fully organized,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.856
so they avoid ever becoming banal.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.216
They have something
but we don't know what it is.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.176
They remain mysterious;
we can't take our eyes off them.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.160
We find them beautiful.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.096
So to do the unnecessary,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.776
to create intimacy,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.296
to be ugly,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.880
to remain incomplete --

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.536
these are not only the qualities
of beautiful organizations,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.000
these are inherently
human characteristics.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.240
And these are also the qualities
of what we call home.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.936
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.256
the least we can do is to ensure

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.296
that we still feel at home
in our organizations,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.720
and that we use our organizations
to create that feeling for others.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.696
Beauty can save the world
when we embrace these principles

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.200
and design for them.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.376
In the face of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.736
we need a new radical humanism.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.160
We must acquire and promote
a new aesthetic and sentimental education.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.680
Because if we don't,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.816
we might end up feeling like aliens

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.856
in organizations and societies
that are full of smart machines

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.696
that have no appreciation whatsoever

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.336
for the unnecessary,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.616
the intimate,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.336
the incomplete

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.040
and definitely not for the ugly.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.976
Thank you.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.862
(Applause)
