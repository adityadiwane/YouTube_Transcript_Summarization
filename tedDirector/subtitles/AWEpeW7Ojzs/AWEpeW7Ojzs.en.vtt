00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.254
It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:22.136
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.668
and cheaper.

00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:25.838
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:27.542
the three million bits of information

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:30.512
in your genome in less than a day

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:32.922
and for less than 1,000 euros.

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.752
Biotech is probably the most powerful

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.776
and the fastest-growing technology sector.

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:42.078
It has the power, potentially,

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:44.295
to replace our fossil fuels,

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:46.512
to revolutionize medicine,

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:50.723
and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:54.555
So who gets to do it?

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.050
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.322
this guy doing it.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.237
But what about

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:05.109
that guy? (Laughter)

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.979
(Laughter)

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.453
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:16.566
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.647
accessible to everyone,

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:22.286
not just scientists and people in government labs.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.826
The idea is that if you open up the science

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:28.629
and you allow diverse groups to participate,

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:30.322
it could really stimulate innovation.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:33.128
Putting technology in the hands of the end user

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:36.317
is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:38.420
of what their needs are.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.557
And here's this really sophisticated technology

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.301
coming down the road, all these associated

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.998
social, moral, ethical questions,

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:50.389
and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.271
just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.

00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.999
So wouldn't it be nice

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.435
if there was a place in your local neighborhood

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.015
where you could go and learn about this stuff,

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:04.338
do it hands-on?

00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:05.853
I thought so.

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:07.733
So, three years ago, I got together

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:11.270
with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.405
and we founded Genspace.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.861
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.215
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:19.984
and the idea was people could come,

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:23.957
they could take classes and putter around in the lab

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:28.069
in a very open, friendly atmosphere.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.710
None of my previous experience prepared me

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.055
for what came next. Can you guess?

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:36.783
The press started calling us.

00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:39.901
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.573
science literacy, the more they wanted to talk

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:45.701
about us creating the next Frankenstein,

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:48.706
and as a result, for the next six months,

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:50.483
when you Googled my name,

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:54.536
instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:56.114
["Am I a biohazard?"]

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:58.247
(Laughter)

00:02:58.247 --> 00:03:00.038
It was pretty depressing.

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:02.998
The only thing that got us through that period

00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:04.859
was that we knew that all over the world,

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.445
there were other people that were trying to do

00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:08.381
the same thing that we were.

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.885
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them

00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:13.526
were facing much greater challenges than we did,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:17.643
more regulations, less resources.

00:03:17.643 --> 00:03:21.842
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:26.260
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.162
and this is just the beginning.

00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:30.223
These are some of the biggest ones,

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:32.287
and there are others opening every day.

00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:35.158
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow,

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:36.457
one in South Korea,

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:38.783
and the cool thing is they each have their own

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.566
individual flavor

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.890
that grew out of the community they came out of.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.029
Let me take you on a little tour.

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.477
Biohackers work alone.

00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:51.037
We work in groups,

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:55.422
in big cities — (Laughter) —

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:58.092
and in small villages.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:00.860
We reverse engineer lab equipment.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.396
We genetically engineer bacteria.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.623
We hack hardware,

00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:07.868
software,

00:04:07.868 --> 00:04:10.292
wetware,

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:13.228
and, of course, the code of life.

00:04:13.228 --> 00:04:16.163
We like to build things.

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:22.550
Then we like to take things apart.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.666
We make things grow.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.468
We make things glow.

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:30.435
And we make cells dance.

00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:34.226
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.667
but, you know, sometimes when people think of us,

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.694
the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,

00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:43.771
bio-security, all the dark side stuff.

00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:46.379
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.176
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use,

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:51.393
and, you know, you get something like

00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:55.243
synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,

00:04:55.243 --> 00:04:57.867
it really compels you, you have to look at both

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:01.280
the amateur groups but also the professional groups,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.731
because they have better infrastructure,

00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.279
they have better facilities,

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.778
and they have access to pathogens.

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:11.058
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently

00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:13.666
issued a report on this whole area,

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.738
and what they concluded was the power of this technology

00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:20.590
for positive was much greater than the risk for negative,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.119
and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:27.664
and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press

00:05:27.664 --> 00:05:31.688
had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:34.223
and underestimate our ethics.

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:37.752
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:40.482
America, Europe, got together last year,

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:43.031
and we hammered out a common code of ethics.

00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.391
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.

00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.039
Now, we follow state and local regulations.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.035
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:55.376
safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:58.079
You know, if you're working with a pathogen,

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.623
you're not part of the biohacker community,

00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:03.776
you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.

00:06:03.776 --> 00:06:05.699
And sometimes people ask me,

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.586
"Well, what about an accident?"

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:11.144
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally

00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:14.503
work with, the chance of an accident happening

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.831
with somebody accidentally creating, like,

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:18.477
some sort of superbug,

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:22.727
that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.799
in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.153
Now, it could happen,

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:30.309
but I'm not going to plan my life around it.

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:33.239
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:36.351
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.823
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,

00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:41.591
they're going to take my entire genomic sequence,

00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:45.263
all of my medical information, and my identity,

00:06:45.263 --> 00:06:49.405
and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.

00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:52.335
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:54.111
during the informed consent portion.

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:55.994
The one I liked the best is,

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:59.839
someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.133
synthesize some fake Ellen DNA,

00:07:02.133 --> 00:07:06.207
and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)

00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:10.737
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and

00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:13.883
the potential for good for a study like that

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:15.935
far outweighs the risk.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.336
Now, you might be asking yourself,

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:21.773
"Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:25.102
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well,

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:28.167
what would anyone do with a personal computer?"

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:30.131
So this stuff is just beginning.

00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:34.007
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.

00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:37.092
Let me show you what you could do right now.

00:07:37.092 --> 00:07:40.927
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:44.161
whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:47.071
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:49.777
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:53.039
to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.933
identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.

00:07:56.933 --> 00:08:03.209
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:06.513
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.

00:08:06.513 --> 00:08:08.453
Looked like a ladybug, right?

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:10.501
It actually is a Japanese beetle.

00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:12.412
And the same kind of technology --

00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:14.496
it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool --

00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:19.362
You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,

00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:22.595
if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese

00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:26.009
that you paid so much for is really goat's.

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:29.910
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.202
for mutations.

00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:34.426
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:37.344
and you can explore your ancestry.

00:08:37.344 --> 00:08:39.701
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:43.323
collect microbes, see what's up there.

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:45.754
You can make a biocensor out of yeast

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:47.941
to detect pollutants in water.

00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:51.573
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.866
You can do a lot of things.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:57.256
You can also do an art science project. Some of these

00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:00.897
are really spectacular, and they look at social,

00:09:00.897 --> 00:09:03.583
ecological problems from a completely different perspective.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.145
It's really cool.

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:08.163
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?

00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:12.258
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.

00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:14.786
The thing is, there's something in these labs

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:17.445
that they have to offer society that you can't find

00:09:17.445 --> 00:09:19.412
anywhere else.

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:22.090
There's something sacred about a space where

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.602
you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:27.476
to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:30.731
that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.

00:09:30.731 --> 00:09:33.658
It just has to follow safety guidelines.

00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:36.514
If you had spaces like this all over the world,

00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:38.746
it could really change the perception

00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:41.278
of who's allowed to do biotech.

00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:44.970
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.386
Why not personal biotech?

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.763
If everyone in this room got involved,

00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:51.511
who knows what we could do?

00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:55.271
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,
