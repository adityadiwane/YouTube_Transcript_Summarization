00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.355
So imagine, you're in the supermarket,

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:16.936
you're buying some groceries,

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:18.561
and you get given the option

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.196
for a plastic or a paper shopping bag.

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:24.386
Which one do you choose if you want to do

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:26.802
the right thing by the environment?

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.683
Most people do pick the paper.

00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:29.911
Okay, let's think of why.

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.604
It's brown to start with.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.080
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.598
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.548
In some cases, it's recyclable.

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:40.342
So when people are looking at the plastic bag,

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.272
it's likely they're thinking of something like this,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.655
which we all know is absolutely terrible,

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.871
and we should be avoiding at all expenses

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.226
these kinds of environmental damages.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:52.439
But people are often not thinking

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:54.457
of something like this,

00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:57.035
which is the other end of the spectrum.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.802
When we produce materials,

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.432
we need to extract them from the environment,

00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:05.336
and we need a whole bunch
of environmental impacts.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.512
You see, what happens is, when we need

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:09.489
to make complex choices,

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.910
us humans like really simple solutions,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.526
and so we often ask for simple solutions.

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:15.999
And I work in design.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.510
I advise designers

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.775
and innovators around sustainability,

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:21.329
and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.251
I just want the eco-materials."

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.535
And I say, "Well, that's very complex,

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.364
and we'll have to spend four hours talking about

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.279
what exactly an eco-material means,

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.199
because everything at some point

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:33.144
comes from nature,

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:35.239
and it's how you use the material

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.280
that dictates the environmental impact.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.069
So what happens is, we have to rely

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.127
on some sort of intuitive framework

00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:43.702
when we make decisions.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.032
So I like to call that intuitive framework

00:01:46.032 --> 00:01:48.627
our environmental folklore.

00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:51.384
It's either the little voice
at the back of your head,

00:01:51.384 --> 00:01:53.656
or it's that gut feeling you get

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.236
when you've done the right thing,

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:56.784
so when you've picked the paper bag

00:01:56.784 --> 00:01:59.899
or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.858
And environmental folklore is a really important thing

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:05.306
because we're trying to do the right thing.

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:07.650
But how do we know if we're actually

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.973
reducing the net environmental impacts

00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:13.314
that our actions as individuals and as professionals

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:15.482
and as a society are actually having

00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:18.187
on the natural environment?

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:20.030
So the thing about environmental folklore is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.085
it tends to be based on our experiences,

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.816
the things we've heard from other people.

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:26.456
It doesn't tend to be based
on any scientific framework.

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:28.123
And this is really hard, because we live

00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:30.143
in incredibly complex systems.

00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:31.863
We have the human systems

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.629
of how we communicate and interrelate

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.144
and have our whole constructed society,

00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:40.037
We have the industrial systems,
which is essentially the entire economy,

00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:41.890
and then all of that has to operate

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.415
within the biggest system,

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.507
and, I would argue, the most important,

00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:47.163
the ecosystem.

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:49.025
And you see, the choices that we make

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.458
as an individual,

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.769
but the choices that we make

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.928
in every single job that we have,

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:56.548
no matter how high or low
you are in the pecking order,

00:02:56.548 --> 00:02:59.599
has an impact on all of these systems.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.934
And the thing is that we have to find ways

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:03.873
if we're actually going to address sustainability

00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:07.021
of interlocking those complex systems

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:09.965
and making better choices that result

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.549
in net environmental gains.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.197
What we need to do is we need to learn

00:03:14.197 --> 00:03:16.273
to do more with less.

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:18.164
We have an increasing population,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.998
and everybody likes their mobile phones,

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:22.113
especially in this situation here.

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:26.168
So we need to find innovative ways of solving
some of these problems that we face.

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:29.363
And that's where this process called
life cycle thinking comes in.

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:32.053
So essentially, everything that is created

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.564
goes through a series of life cycle stages,

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:36.426
and we use this scientific process

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:38.150
called life cycle assessment,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.891
or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,

00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:44.438
in order to have a clearer picture of how

00:03:44.438 --> 00:03:48.244
everything that we do in the
technical part of those systems

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:50.025
affects the natural environment.

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:51.995
So we go all the way back

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.198
to the extraction of raw materials,

00:03:54.198 --> 00:03:56.015
and then we look at manufacturing,

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:57.874
we look at packaging and transportation,

00:03:57.874 --> 00:03:59.524
use, and end of life,

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:02.441
and at every single one of these stages,

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.960
the things that we do

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.791
have an interaction with the natural environment,

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.279
and we can monitor how that interaction

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.009
is actually affecting the systems and services

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.924
that make life on Earth possible.

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.560
And through doing this,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.850
we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.563
And we've busted a bunch of myths.

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:26.551
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.284
It's used a lot in marketing,

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:30.284
and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation

00:04:30.284 --> 00:04:32.217
when we're talking about sustainability,

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:34.663
and that's the word biodegradability.

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:39.611
Now biodegradability is a material property;

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.859
it is not a definition of environmental benefits.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:44.762
Allow me to explain.

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:46.454
When something natural,

00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:48.415
something that's made from a cellulose fiber

00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:51.943
like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:54.231
or even a piece of paper,

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.045
when something natural ends up

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.668
in the natural environment, it degrades normally.

00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:00.532
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.669
as it was growing are naturally released

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.249
back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.223
but this is a net situation.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.588
Most natural things

00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:10.195
don't actually end up in nature.

00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:13.606
Most of the things, the waste that 
we produce, end up in landfill.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:16.008
Landfill is a different environment.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:18.451
In landfill, those same carbon molecules

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.969
degrade in a different way,

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.881
because a landfill is anaerobic.

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.299
It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:27.647
Those same molecules, they become methane,

00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:30.565
and methane is a 25 times more potent

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:33.418
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:36.171
So our old lettuces and products

00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:37.750
that we have thrown out that are made

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.320
out of biodegradable materials,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.055
if they end up in landfill,

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:43.081
contribute to climate change.

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.473
You see, there are facilities now

00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:46.177
that can actually capture that methane

00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:47.615
and generate power,

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.406
displacing the need for fossil fuel power,

00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:51.871
but we need to be smart about this.

00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.036
We need to identify how we can start to leverage

00:05:55.036 --> 00:05:57.340
these types of things that are already happening

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.208
and start to design systems and services

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.091
that alleviate these problems.

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:04.336
Because right now, what people do
is they turn around and they say,

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:06.895
"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper

00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:08.822
because that is better for the environment."

00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:10.240
But if you're throwing it in the bin,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.703
and your local landfill facility

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:14.124
is just a normal one,

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:19.030
then we're having what's called a double negative.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.194
I'm a product designer by trade.

00:06:22.194 --> 00:06:23.386
I then did social science.

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:24.803
And so I'm absolutely fascinated

00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:26.802
by consumer goods and how the consumer goods

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:28.924
that we have kind of become immune to

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:30.162
that fill our lives

00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:31.970
have an impact on the natural environment.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.583
And these guys are, like, serial offenders,

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:36.446
and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.076
has a refrigerator.

00:06:38.076 --> 00:06:39.708
Now America has this amazing ability

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:41.717
to keep growing refrigerators.

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:43.695
In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.543
on average, the standard size

00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:47.172
of a refrigerator.

00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:49.631
And the problem is, they're so big now,

00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:51.825
it's easier for us to buy more food

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:53.816
that we can't eat or find.

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.442
I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator

00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:57.652
that have been there for years, all right?

00:06:57.652 --> 00:07:00.288
And so what happens is, we waste more food.

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:03.633
And as I was just explaining,
food waste is a problem.

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:06.995
In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent

00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:09.570
of food purchased for the home is wasted.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.905
Half of the world's produced food is wasted.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.558
That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.

00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:21.095
It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.

00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.099
And I blame it on the refrigerator,

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:24.627
well, especially in Western cultures,

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:26.477
because it makes it easier.

00:07:26.477 --> 00:07:28.869
I mean, there's a lot of complex
systems going on here.

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:30.807
I don't want to make it so simplistic.

00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:33.757
But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,

00:07:33.757 --> 00:07:35.615
and one of the features of it

00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:37.577
is the crisper drawer.

00:07:37.577 --> 00:07:39.078
You all got crisper drawers?

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.013
The drawer that you put your lettuces in?

00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:42.933
Lettuces have a habit of going soggy

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:44.729
in the crisper drawers, don't they?

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.139
Yeah? Soggy lettuces?

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:48.139
In the U.K., this is such a problem

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:49.837
that there was a government report a few years ago

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:52.857
that actually said the second biggest offender

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:55.274
of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.692
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.

00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.905
Okay? So this is a problem, people.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:02.015
These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.887
left, right and center because the crisper drawers

00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:06.646
are not designed to actually keep things crisp.

00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:08.855
Okay. You need a tight environment.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.985
You need, like, an airless environment

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:13.710
to prevent the degrading that
would happen naturally.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.662
But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.370
with a slightly better seal.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.457
Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.182
Don't ever invite me over because I'll just
start going through your refrigerator

00:08:22.182 --> 00:08:23.700
and looking at all sorts of things like that.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.619
But essentially, this is a big problem.

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:28.578
Because when we lose something
like the lettuce from the system,

00:08:28.578 --> 00:08:32.114
not only do we have that impact 
I just explained at the end of life,

00:08:32.114 --> 00:08:34.770
but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.041
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:39.459
We've had to clear land.

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:41.616
We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,

00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.740
fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.828
All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce

00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:47.540
get lost from the system,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.151
which makes it a far bigger environmental impact

00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:53.835
than the loss of the energy from the fridge.

00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:57.100
So we need to design things like this far better

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.281
if we're going to start addressing
serious environmental problems.

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:01.932
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size.

00:09:01.932 --> 00:09:03.684
For those of you in the room who do design fridges,

00:09:03.684 --> 00:09:05.177
that would be great.

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:08.275
The problem is, imagine if we

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:10.925
actually started to reconsider 
how we designed things.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:14.532
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,

00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:16.630
but we actually haven't really changed the design

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.301
of them that much since the 1950s.

00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:22.526
A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,

00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:24.448
cold boxes that we store stuff in.

00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:26.268
So imagine if we actually really started

00:09:26.268 --> 00:09:29.013
to identify these problems and use that

00:09:29.013 --> 00:09:32.950
as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.303
design solutions that will solve those problems.

00:09:36.303 --> 00:09:38.528
This is design-led system change,

00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:42.238
design dictating the way in which the system

00:09:42.238 --> 00:09:45.003
can be far more sustainable.

00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:47.097
Forty percent food waste is a major problem.

00:09:47.097 --> 00:09:51.162
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.

00:09:51.162 --> 00:09:53.513
Another item that I find fascinating

00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:54.766
is the electric tea kettle,

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.159
which I found out that

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:59.410
you don't do tea kettles in
this country, really, do you?

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.498
But that's really big in the U.K.

00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:03.731
Ninety-seven percent of households

00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:06.663
in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.

00:10:06.663 --> 00:10:08.270
So they're very popular.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.070
And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.322
or a designer, and they were designing one of these,

00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:14.561
and they wanted to do it eco,

00:10:14.561 --> 00:10:16.479
they'd usually ask me two things.

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:19.523
They'd say, "Leyla, how do I
make it technically efficient?"

00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:22.811
Because obviously energy's
a problem with this product.

00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:25.876
Or, "How do I make it green materials?

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.786
How do I make the materials green

00:10:28.786 --> 00:10:30.608
in the manufacturing?"

00:10:30.608 --> 00:10:32.411
Would you ask me those questions?

00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:35.210
They seem logical, right? Yeah.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.769
Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:39.927
Because the problem is with use.

00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:42.602
It's with how people use the product.

00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:44.437
Sixty-five percent of Brits

00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:46.781
admit to over-filling their kettle

00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:49.367
when they only need one cup of tea.

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:52.110
All of this extra water that's being boiled

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.078
requires energy, and it's been calculated

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:59.116
that in one day of extra energy use

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.659
from boiling kettles

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:03.301
is enough to light all of the streetlights

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:05.924
in England for a night.

00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:08.042
But this is the thing.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.956
This is what I call a product-person failure.

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:12.702
But we've got a product-system failure
going on with these little guys,

00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:15.612
and they're so ubiquitous, you 
don't even notice they're there.

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:18.825
And this guy over here, though, he does.
He's named Simon.

00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:22.132
Simon works for the national
electricity company in the U.K.

00:11:22.132 --> 00:11:24.274
He has a very important job of monitoring

00:11:24.274 --> 00:11:26.713
all of the electricity coming into the system

00:11:26.713 --> 00:11:28.126
to make sure there is enough

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:30.054
so it powers everybody's homes.

00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:32.158
He's also watching television.

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:34.131
The reason is because there's a unique

00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:35.949
phenomenon that happens in the U.K.

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:39.987
the moment that very popular TV shows end.

00:11:39.987 --> 00:11:42.225
The minute the ad break comes on,

00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:44.062
this man has to rush

00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:47.118
to buy nuclear power from France,

00:11:47.118 --> 00:11:50.007
because everybody turns their kettles on

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:52.072
at the same time.

00:11:52.072 --> 00:11:54.318
(Laughter)

00:11:54.318 --> 00:12:00.303
1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.872
So imagine if you designed kettles,

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:06.612
you actually found a way to
solve these system failures,

00:12:06.612 --> 00:12:09.277
because this is a huge amount of pressure

00:12:09.277 --> 00:12:10.668
on the system,

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:14.104
just because the product hasn't
thought about the problem

00:12:14.104 --> 00:12:15.967
that it's going to have when it exists in the world.

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:18.635
Now, I looked at a number of
kettles available on the market,

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:20.657
and found the minimum fill lines,

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.423
so the little piece of information that tells you

00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:23.980
how much you need to put in there,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.899
was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:30.332
just to make one cup of tea.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.617
So this kettle here is an example of one where

00:12:32.617 --> 00:12:35.153
it actually has two reservoirs.

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.340
One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.665
The user actually has to push that button

00:12:39.665 --> 00:12:41.233
to get their hot water boiled,

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:42.999
which means, because we're all lazy,

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:44.841
you only fill exactly what you need.

00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:47.165
And this is what I call behavior-changing products:

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:49.277
products, systems or services

00:12:49.277 --> 00:12:53.136
that intervene and solve these problems up front.

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:55.786
Now, this is a technology arena,

00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:57.847
so obviously these things are quite popular,

00:12:57.847 --> 00:12:59.815
but I think if we're going to keep

00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:02.401
designing, buying and using and throwing out

00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:04.313
these kinds of products at the rate we currently do,

00:13:04.313 --> 00:13:06.562
which is astronomically high,

00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:08.396
there are seven billion people

00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:09.806
who live in the world right now.

00:13:09.806 --> 00:13:11.993
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions

00:13:11.993 --> 00:13:15.659
as of last year.

00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:19.181
Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones

00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:20.434
roll off production lines,

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.505
and some companies report their production rate

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:24.855
as being greater than the human birth rate.

00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:27.985
One hundred fifty-two million phones 
were thrown out in the U.S. last year;

00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:29.869
only 11 percent were recycled.

00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:33.227
I'm from Australia. We have a
population of 22 million -- don't laugh --

00:13:33.227 --> 00:13:36.300
and it's been reported that 22 million phones

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.907
are in people's drawers.

00:13:38.907 --> 00:13:42.628
We need to find ways of solving
the problems around this,

00:13:42.628 --> 00:13:45.525
because these things are so complicated.

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:48.831
They have so much locked up inside them.

00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:52.594
Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now

00:13:52.594 --> 00:13:56.211
to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.439
than it is out of a ton of gold ore?

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:01.829
There's a number of highly complex and valuable

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:03.430
materials embodied inside these things,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.888
so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,

00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:08.052
because this is otherwise what happens.

00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:09.726
This is a community in Ghana,

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:11.984
and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:13.960
is reported by the U.N.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.992
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked.

00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:18.306
This is how they get the gold

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:19.840
and the other valuable materials out.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.778
They burn the electronic waste

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.809
in open spaces.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:26.944
These are communities, and this
is happening all over the world.

00:14:26.944 --> 00:14:29.491
And because we don't see the ramifications

00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:31.320
of the choices that we make as designers,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.790
as businesspeople, as consumers,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.403
then these kinds of externalities happen,

00:14:35.403 --> 00:14:37.705
and these are people's lives.

00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:42.153
So we need to find smarter, more systems-based,

00:14:42.153 --> 00:14:45.069
innovative solutions to these problems,

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:48.845
if we're going to start to live
sustainably within this world.

00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:52.818
So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:54.508
your new one because you replaced your old one --

00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:56.883
after 15 to 18 months is the average time

00:14:56.883 --> 00:14:58.987
that people replace their phones, by the way —

00:14:58.987 --> 00:15:01.972
so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient

00:15:01.972 --> 00:15:04.210
mobile phone replacing, then we should

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.259
be looking at closing the loop on these systems.

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:08.170
The people who produce these phones,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.999
and some of which I'm sure
are in the room right now,

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:12.677
could potentially look at doing what
we call closed-loop systems,

00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:14.245
or product system services,

00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:16.507
so identifying that there is a market demand

00:15:16.507 --> 00:15:18.324
and that market demand's not going to go anywhere,

00:15:18.324 --> 00:15:21.377
so you design the product to solve the problem.

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:23.716
Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting.

00:15:23.716 --> 00:15:26.082
We heard some of those kinds of strategies

00:15:26.082 --> 00:15:28.941
being used in the Tesla Motors car today.

00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:31.053
These kinds of approaches are not hard,

00:15:31.053 --> 00:15:32.911
but understanding the system

00:15:32.911 --> 00:15:36.442
and then looking for viable, market-driven

00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:38.425
consumer demand alternatives

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.976
is how we can start radically altering

00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:42.783
the sustainability agenda,

00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:44.654
because I hate to break it to you all:

00:15:44.654 --> 00:15:47.457
Consumption is the biggest problem.

00:15:47.457 --> 00:15:52.719
But design is one of the best solutions.

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.903
These kinds of products are everywhere.

00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:57.571
By identifying alternative ways of doing things,

00:15:57.571 --> 00:15:59.166
we can actually start to innovate,

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.559
and I say actually start to innovate.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:03.044
I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.

00:16:03.044 --> 00:16:05.398
But in the regards to using sustainability

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:08.085
as a parameter, as a criteria

00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:12.302
for fueling systems-based solutions,

00:16:12.302 --> 00:16:15.207
because as I've just demonstrated
with these simple products,

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:18.598
they're participating in these major problems.

00:16:18.598 --> 00:16:20.753
So we need to look across the entire life

00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:22.375
of the things that we do.

00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:24.090
If you just had paper or plastic --

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.854
obviously reusable is far more beneficial --

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:30.325
then the paper is worse,

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:32.371
and the paper is worse because it weighs

00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:34.475
four to 10 times more than the plastic,

00:16:34.475 --> 00:16:36.842
and when we actually compare,
from a life cycle perspective,

00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:39.532
a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.178
the paper is far better,

00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:43.718
but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag

00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:47.333
to carry your groceries home is not 
done with a kilo of each material.

00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:49.302
It's done with a very small amount of plastic

00:16:49.302 --> 00:16:50.995
and quite a lot more paper.

00:16:50.995 --> 00:16:53.953
Because functionality defines environmental impact,

00:16:53.953 --> 00:16:56.786
and I said earlier that the designers
always ask me for the eco-materials.

00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:59.810
I say, there's only a few materials
that you should completely avoid.

00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:01.730
The rest of them, it's all about application,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.749
and at the end of the day, everything
we design and produce in the economy

00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:07.089
or buy as consumers is done so for function.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.206
We want something, therefore we buy it.

00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:12.362
So breaking things back down and delivering

00:17:12.362 --> 00:17:16.361
smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions

00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:19.158
that take into consideration the entire system

00:17:19.158 --> 00:17:22.253
and the entire life of the thing, everything,

00:17:22.253 --> 00:17:25.089
all the way back to the extraction
through to the end of life,

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.891
we can start to actually find
really innovative solutions.

00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.961
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing

00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:33.818
that a designer said to me recently 
who I work with, a senior designer.

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:36.916
I said, "How come you're not doing 
sustainability? I know you know this."

00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:40.928
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched
a sustainability project to a client,

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:42.869
and turned and he said to me,

00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:44.634
'I know it's going to cost less,

00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:46.252
I know it's going to sell more,

00:17:46.252 --> 00:17:50.725
but we're not pioneers, because
pioneers have arrows in their backs.'"

00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.942
I think we've got a roomful of pioneers,

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:55.996
and I hope there are far more pioneers out there,
because we need to solve these problems.

00:17:56.027 --> 00:17:57.434
Thank you.

00:17:57.434 --> 00:18:02.210
(Applause)
