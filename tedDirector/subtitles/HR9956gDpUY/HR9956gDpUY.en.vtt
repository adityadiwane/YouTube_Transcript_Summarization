00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:15.116
It was just an ordinary Saturday.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.356
My dad was outside mowing the lawn,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.636
my mom was upstairs folding laundry,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.796
my sister was in her room doing homework

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.180
and I was in the basement
playing video games.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.236
And as I came upstairs
to get something to drink,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.476
I looked out the window

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.796
and realized that there was something
that I was supposed to be doing,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.020
and this is what I saw.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.796
No, this wasn't
my family's dinner on fire.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.460
This was my science project.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.516
Flames were pouring out,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.756
smoke was in the air

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.996
and it looked like our wooden deck
was about to catch fire.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.836
I immediately started yelling.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.356
My mom was freaking out,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.476
my dad ran around to put out the fire

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.636
and of course my sister
started recording a Snapchat video.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.556
(Laughter)

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.780
This was just the beginning
of my team's science project.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.956
My team is composed of me
and three other students

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.660
who are here in the audience today.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.116
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.676
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.556
and in addition to a robotics game,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.956
we also worked
on a separate science project,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.676
and this was the project
that we were working on.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.676
So the idea for this project all started

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.956
when a few months earlier,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.796
a couple of my teammates
took a trip to Central America

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.316
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.300
or expanded polystyrene foam.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.996
And when they came back
and told us about it,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.716
we really started thinking about the ways
in which we see Styrofoam every day.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.356
Get a new flat-screen TV?

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.340
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.356
Drink a cup of coffee?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.556
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
are sure going to add up.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.956
And where do all these items go
after their one-time use?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.396
Since there aren't any good
existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.956
almost all of them
end up right in the landfill,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.316
or the oceans and beaches,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.036
taking over 500 years to degrade.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.276
And in fact, every year, the US alone

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.956
produces over two billion
pounds of Styrofoam,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.156
filling up a staggering
25 percent of landfills.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.260
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.660
Why can't we just recycle them
like many plastics?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.636
Well, simply put, recycled
polystyrene is too expensive

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.236
and potentially contaminated,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.476
so there is very little market demand
for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.036
And as a result, Styrofoam
is considered a nonrenewable material,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.820
because it is neither feasible
nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.996
And in fact, many cities across the US

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.436
have even passed ordinances

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.076
that simply ban the production
of many products containing polystyrene,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.156
which includes disposable utensils,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.356
packing peanuts, takeout containers

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.516
and even plastic beach toys,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.516
all products that are very useful
in today's society.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.716
And now France
has become the first country

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.996
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.620
cups and plates.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.516
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.276
and keep benefiting
from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.036
and excellent packing ability,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.396
while not having to suffer
from the repercussions

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.740
of having to dispose of it?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.636
What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.220
What if we could make
the impossible possible?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.796
My team hypothesized that we could use
the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.516
to create activated carbon,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900
which is used in almost
every water filter today.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.916
And activated carbon works
by using very small micropores

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.900
to filter out contaminants
from water or even air.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.836
So we started out
by doing a variety of heating tests,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.940
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.996
Literally, nothing worked.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.276
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.956
most of our samples
vaporized into nothing,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.396
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.660
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.860
In fact, we were so saddened
by our failures that we almost gave up.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.516
So why did we keep trying

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.916
when all the adults
said it was impossible?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.860
Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
We don't know any better.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.076
But the truth is, we kept trying
because we thought it was still possible.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.796
We knew that if we were successful,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.236
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.916
So we kept trying

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.676
and failing

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.356
and trying

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.956
and failing.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.620
We were so ready to give up.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.036
But then it happened.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.756
With the right temperatures,
times and chemicals,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.036
we finally got that successful test result

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.875
showing us that we had created
activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.476
And at that moment,
the thing that had been impossible

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.740
all of a sudden wasn't.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.356
It showed us that although we had
many failures at the beginning,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.076
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.036
And moreover, not only were we able
to create activated carbon

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.316
for purifying water,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.796
but we were also able
to reduce Styrofoam waste,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.580
solving two global problems
with just one solution.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.076
So from then on, we were inspired
to take our project further,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.316
performing more tests
to make it more effective

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.676
and testing it in real world situations.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.436
We then proceeded to receive funding

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.436
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
STEM-in-Action program

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.196
sponsored by the US Army,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.596
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.900
sponsored by XPRIZE.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.716
And we were also honored

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.516
with the Scientific American
Innovator Award

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.780
from Google Science Fair.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.756
And using these funds, we plan
to file a full patent on our process

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.660
and to continue to work on our project.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.436
So yes, although we started
with catching my dad's grill on fire

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.956
and failing so many times
that we almost quit,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.516
it was well worth it
when we look back at it now.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.356
We took a problem
that many people said was impossible

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.876
and we made it possible,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.156
and we persevered when it looked
like nothing that we did would work.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.276
We learned that you can't have success

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.796
without a little,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.580
or a lot, of failure.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.876
So in the future, don't be afraid
if your grill goes up in flames,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.780
because you never know
when your idea might just catch fire.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.836
Thank you.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.340
(Applause)
