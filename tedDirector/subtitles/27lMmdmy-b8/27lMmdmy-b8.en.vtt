00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.092
I'm going to start with a little story.

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:17.204
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.755
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.716
over four months, slowly wasting away until

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:27.604
I was basically a famine victim

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.628
with an unquenchable thirst.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:33.237
I had basically digested away my body.

00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:37.531
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.576
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:43.560
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.816
of water and drinking like a dog.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:50.328
That night, I was taken into the emergency room

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:54.209
and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.

00:00:54.209 --> 00:01:00.144
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:05.600
insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.111
And something festered inside me after this happened.

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:14.624
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.477
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease

00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:19.852
where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:22.893
that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:27.365
had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.423
and then kill the cells that make insulin.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.733
And this is what I thought for a long period of time,

00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:35.781
and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:38.703
the microbes that do bad things.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:41.771
And that's where I need my assistant here now.

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:44.209
You may recognize her.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.889
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.130
and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.577
and they sell toys, giant microbes.

00:01:57.577 --> 00:02:00.962
And here we go!

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:05.717
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:10.145
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.852
(Laughter)

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:20.233
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:23.576
they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.545
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.192
and that's what I was focusing on.

00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:32.753
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:37.273
and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:38.393
rather than killing us.

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:41.584
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:45.161
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,

00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:46.953
I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:49.051
(Laughter)

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.993
The microbes that cover us.

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:54.153
And if you look at them in the microscope,

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.557
you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells

00:02:57.557 --> 00:03:01.025
of microbes on us as we have human cells.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:05.776
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:10.097
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:14.697
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:16.977
just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:19.557
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.

00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:22.085
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.621
and to understand them is to look at their DNA.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.763
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:30.645
using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:33.549
including the human body, reading the DNA sequence

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.169
and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.335
the microbes that are in a particular place.

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:41.198
And what's amazing, when you use this technology,

00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:44.358
for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:45.494
in a sea of microbes.

00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:50.605
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:55.958
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.605
microbiome covering us.

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:01.110
And so this microbial diversity differs between people,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.246
and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:07.366
maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.414
this microbial cloud in and on us,

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:13.294
and the variation between us, may be responsible

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:16.864
for some of the health and illness differences between us.

00:04:16.864 --> 00:04:19.987
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:23.393
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:25.774
for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,

00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:30.165
but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:31.662
that live in and on you.

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:34.366
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:38.399
in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.638
of immune response and led to me killing the cells

00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:42.859
that make insulin in my body.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:45.955
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:49.747
what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:53.406
in particular, to study the microbial cloud

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:54.980
that lives in and on us.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.444
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.

00:04:57.444 --> 00:05:00.238
My first personal experience with studying the microbes

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:04.388
on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.188
right around the corner from here at Georgetown.

00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:09.205
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:11.748
the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:14.238
and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:17.588
a study of ileal transplants in people.

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:21.564
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.

00:05:21.564 --> 00:05:24.628
And so I started a collaboration with this person,

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:27.901
Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes

00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.374
that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.516
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study

00:05:35.516 --> 00:05:37.766
that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:40.990
is something really striking that they did at the beginning

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.013
of this project.

00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:46.378
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.661
and they have a recipient who might have a problem

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:51.286
with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:54.846
and they sterilized the donor ileum.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:59.141
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.805
They did this because this was common practice

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:04.934
in medicine, even though it was obvious

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:07.072
that this was not a good idea.

00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:10.077
And fortunately, in the course of this project,

00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:12.640
the transplant surgeons and the other people

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.061
decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.

00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.206
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:25.206
community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:28.782
and theoretically that might help the people who are

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:30.871
receiving this ileal transplant.

00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:34.173
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:36.478
In the last few years there's been a great expansion

00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:40.656
in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.

00:06:40.656 --> 00:06:42.464
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:44.320
that's going on in the United States,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.854
and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:50.043
And when people have done a variety of studies,

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:53.675
they have learned things such as, when a baby is

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:56.659
born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:57.851
microbes from your mother.

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.907
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:04.938
some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization

00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:07.330
when you carve a baby out of its mother

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.155
rather than being delivered through the birth canal.

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:13.604
And a variety of other studies have shown that the

00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:15.411
microbial community that lives in and on us

00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.674
helps in development of the immune system,

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:22.619
helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:25.699
and determining our metabolic rate, probably

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.874
determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior

00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:30.810
in a variety of ways.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.866
And so, these studies have documented or suggested

00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:38.153
out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,

00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:42.690
this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.274
And one area that I think is very interesting,

00:07:46.274 --> 00:07:48.940
which many of you may have now that we've thrown

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.870
microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.829
So people are really into cleanliness, right?

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:57.808
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,

00:07:57.808 --> 00:08:00.904
people are washing every part of them all of the time,

00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:05.930
we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.371
we take antibiotics excessively.

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:12.210
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.474
but we should understand that when we pump chemicals

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.371
and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing

00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:20.666
the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.666
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:26.895
has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors

00:08:26.895 --> 00:08:31.151
for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety

00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:33.055
of problems that are probably due to disruption

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:36.159
of the microbial community.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.511
So the microbial community can go wrong

00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:41.223
whether we want it to or not,

00:08:41.223 --> 00:08:43.471
or we can kill it with antibiotics,

00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:45.567
but what can we do to restore it?

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.679
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:51.687
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore

00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:54.111
the microbial community that is in and on you.

00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:57.583
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.

00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.680
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.575
probiotics to try and treat, prevent,

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:06.087
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.495
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.

00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:12.015
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent

00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:15.151
the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.816
in these premature infants.

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:20.807
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.

00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:24.162
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:28.949
have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:32.615
and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.

00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:36.543
So what can we do to restore our microbial community

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:39.742
when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?

00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:42.448
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:46.462
they eat poo -- coprophagia.

00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:51.071
And it turns out that many veterinarians,

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.080
old school veterinarians in particular,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.796
have been doing something called "poo tea,"

00:09:55.796 --> 00:10:01.601
not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.224
ailments in horses and cows and things like that,

00:10:05.224 --> 00:10:09.172
where you make tea from the poo from a healthy

00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:12.321
individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.

00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.761
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.300
and you can put your hand into its rumen,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.708
it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes

00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:25.637
directly into the mouth and through the entire

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:29.285
top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:33.405
so you may have heard in people they are now doing

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:38.055
fecal transplants, where rather than delivering

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:40.487
a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,

00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:43.940
they are delivering a community of probiotics,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.420
a community of microbes from a healthy donor,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.557
through the other end.

00:10:48.557 --> 00:10:51.887
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting

00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:54.253
certain intransigent infectious diseases

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:58.092
like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:00.189
with people for years and years and years.

00:11:00.189 --> 00:11:05.052
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,

00:11:05.052 --> 00:11:07.917
from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.778
systemic C. dif infections in some people.

00:11:10.778 --> 00:11:16.620
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.079
the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:22.823
have come up with this same idea, is that

00:11:22.823 --> 00:11:26.711
the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.

00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:31.718
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.

00:11:31.718 --> 00:11:35.709
We should treat it carefully and with respect,

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:39.689
and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:44.597
or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,

00:11:44.597 --> 00:11:47.814
without some real good justification.

00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:51.454
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:58.406
is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:00.941
and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.

00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.774
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,

00:12:04.774 --> 00:12:07.198
and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.

00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:11.278
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes

00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:14.581
and their genes and see if there are differences.

00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:17.983
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not

00:12:17.983 --> 00:12:20.607
just correlative differences, but causative.

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:24.077
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.286
are also helping do this, but people are now using

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:29.590
these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.504
to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.

00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:38.094
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.301
I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.

00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:44.065
It turns out that my father was an M.D.,

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:48.537
actually studied hormones. I told him many times

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:53.327
that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.

00:12:53.327 --> 00:12:56.206
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:59.485
I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:02.104
M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."

00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:05.325
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology

00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:07.455
meeting as family in Quebec.

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:12.949
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:15.384
and drinking everybody's water at the table,

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:18.318
and I think they all thought I was a druggie.

00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:20.038
(Laughter)

00:13:20.038 --> 00:13:22.014
But the reason I'm telling you this is that

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:25.014
the medical community, my father as an example,

00:13:25.014 --> 00:13:28.581
sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.

00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:32.566
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

00:13:32.566 --> 00:13:35.366
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.

00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:36.837
They're microbes. They're tiny.

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:39.789
But we can see them through their DNA,

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:43.038
we can see them through the effects that they have on people.

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:44.656
And what we need now

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:48.325
is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context

00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:50.838
of everything in human medicine.

00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:53.905
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,

00:13:53.905 --> 00:13:55.304
but it might.

00:13:55.304 --> 00:13:59.229
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes

00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:02.622
that live in and on people, so that we can understand

00:14:02.622 --> 00:14:05.894
what they're doing to our lives.

00:14:05.894 --> 00:14:08.965
We are them. They are us.

00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:10.293
Thank you.

00:14:10.293 --> 00:14:12.278
(Applause)
