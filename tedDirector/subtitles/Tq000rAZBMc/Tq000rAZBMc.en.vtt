00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Welcome to 10,000 feet.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Let me explain why we are here

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.160
and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
Today's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
or in some cases, non-existent.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.160
of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
basically civilization's story so far.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
It's an incubator for about a dozen projects,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.160
all having to do with continuity over the long term.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly --

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.160
I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
that can really keep good time for that long a period.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.160
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160
Go to the clock. And what we have here is something

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
many of you saw here three years ago.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
It's the first working prototype of the clock.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
It's about nine feet high.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
So the design problem for today is going to be,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Well, this was the first solution.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Alexander Rose came up with this idea

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.160
of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
about, what does deep time do to a building?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Well, this is what deep time does to a building.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
and look what happened to it.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Even the most durable and intactable buildings,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
They've been looted inside and out.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
How about underground with a view?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Underground in a place that's really solid.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
You don't want just any mountain.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
You need absolutely the right mountain

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160
So here's an image of the long view of the search problem.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
We looked at mesas in New Mexico.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
led us to Eastern Nevada,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
to America's newest and oldest national park,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
which is called Great Basin National Park.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and on the right it's gentle.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.160
America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Inside the green line is national forest.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.160
this vertical, was available because it was private land.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.160
who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.160
of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
That's a 2,000-foot thick formation,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
to get up to where the clock is.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.160
to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.160
It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
of the goal at the end of the journey.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
In this case it might well be an image of the clock.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.160
The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Then there should always be in sight the draw --

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
to finish the process of getting there.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
spent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,"

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
and it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
so that a peal of 10 bells

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160
makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
January 7003. There it is.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
OK, back to Danny's list.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.160
Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.160
The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
Then there's the return.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
And then, how about a memento? Number seven.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
At the end of it there's something physical,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
a kind of reward that you take away.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Something that's just yours.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
How do you study a mountain

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
for the kinds of things we're talking about?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
This is not a normal building project.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
What do you look for?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.160
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160
that's national park. That's sacrosanct --

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
There's possibilities. The borders are important.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160
It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
They're the world's oldest living thing.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.160
People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.160
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160
The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
some of them go back 10,000 years.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
The stone itself is absolutely beautiful,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
join us on the expedition.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.160
now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160
That's interesting.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.160
You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. 

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
was discovered, led by a theory.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
Edmund Schulman in the 1950s

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.160
called, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.160
And then, based on that principle, he started looking around

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
at the various trees at Timberline,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and realized that the bristlecone pines --

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.160
he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.160
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. 

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.160
OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:06.160
when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.160
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.160
And we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
(Laughter)

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.160
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.160
and take a hell of a tax deduction.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
(Laughter)

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.160
we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.160
This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160
It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.160
due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.160
as you'll see when we go inside in a minute,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.160
we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
And shale is not quite completely competent rock.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
The shale would like some shoring,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160
and so parts of it are caved in in there.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
on some of the collapsed timbers.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.160
OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
and it dates back to 1870.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
That's what the property was originally built around --

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.160
it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
and it ran year round.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.160
You may recognize a couple of the miners there.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.160
There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, 

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.160
which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.160
They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.160
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
And they also found four species of bats in there.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
They don't quite, but it's something to think about.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
They don't quite meet.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
Way more interesting than Monterey even today.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
And it's a pretty interesting scene.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
who's the regional head of the National Forest Service,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160
We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually --

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
10,000-year temporary use permit.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
(Laughter)

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
The weather station's pretty interesting.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.160
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
It runs on solar, and it sends a signal
with that antenna

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:23.160
and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.160
to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and then sent through landlines to San Francisco,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.160
where we put the data in real time up on our website.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.160
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
Let's go to approaches.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.160
As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
just a few old mining roads like this,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.160
so you have to bushwhack everywhere.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.160
and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. 

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Well, here's a potential approach.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:22.160
until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.160
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
And you can carry right on up through meadows

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.160
and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
where there's a bit of a problem.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160
Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.160
"Make the clock inaccessible.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160
The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.160
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.160
So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
(Laughter)

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
but your emotional affect goes up,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
which is great for having a mythic experience,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
whether you want to or not.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.160
by how much math he can't do in his head.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160
(Laughter)

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote, 

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.160
"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
I'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful."

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:14.160
"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160
It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien."

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160
And I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful."

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.160
And then, of course, the next thing I hear is,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.160
And he dashed across the top of the mountains.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.160
First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.160
and a solo ascent at that.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
and what to do with them.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.160
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
How about Zander's Crevice? No.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.160
(Laughter)

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
Zander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
called the Siq, and so this is the Siq.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160
and I'm not sure you can.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
and that brings it out.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
and Danny looked over to the right

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.160
and noticed something halfway up the cliffs,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.160
which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.160
and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.160
could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.160
And the people toiling up the mountain could see them,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160
these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.160
How did they get there? Do I have to do that?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.160
You can get another angle on Danny's porch

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:58.160
by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. 

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.160
by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.160
and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.160
which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160
the clock will keep perfectly good time.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.160
So here we're looking from the south, look north.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.160
This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.160
that's some of the Long Now land in those trees.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.160
And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.160
what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.160
And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:50.160
That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.160
Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.160
it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.160
there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160
That's what it looks like looking down it.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160
We should probably put in a rail or something.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.160
Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.160
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.160
You also see there a bighorn sheep.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.160
he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.160
would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
because the real peak is hidden around the corner.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.160
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
And as it turned out the answer is, yes,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.160
that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
and that might be conjured with.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.160
We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
One is the experience of the mountain.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.160
Another is the experience in the mountain.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.160
And the third is the experience from the mountain,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.160
which is really dominated by the view shed

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.160
of the spring valley there behind Danny,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
and if you look off to the right, out there,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.160
15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160
using the water from the mountains.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.160
In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.160
and I'll take you there for a minute.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160
It's a very nice ranch.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.160
Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.160
and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.160
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.160
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.160
you'll see what the valley used to look like.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.160
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.160
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.160
if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.160
because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.160
dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, 

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.160
and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.160
for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.160
and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.160
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.160
The clock experience should be profound,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.160
but from the outside it should be invisible.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.160
Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.160
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.160
You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160
And then you could have an entrance

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.160
which was very rough and narrow as you first went in,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.160
that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.160
And this stone takes a perfect polish.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.160
You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.160
eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.160
And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.160
of the basic structure of the mountain,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.160
and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. 

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.160
This is architecture not made by building,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.160
but by what you very carefully take away.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.160
So that's what the mountain taught us.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160
Most of the amazingness of the clock

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.160
we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.160
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.160
It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.160
for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:11.160
They say, "pin peya obe" -- welcome to the mountain.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
Thank you.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.160
(Applause)
