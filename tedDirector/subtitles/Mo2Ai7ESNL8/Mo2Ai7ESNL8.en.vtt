00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:17.802
So recently, we heard a lot about
how social media helps empower protest,

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.181
and that's true,

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.836
but after more than a decade

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:24.501
of studying and participating
in multiple social movements,

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.303
I've come to realize

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:29.614
that the way technology
empowers social movements

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:32.720
can also paradoxically help weaken them.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.604
This is not inevitable,
but overcoming it requires diving deep

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:40.897
into what makes success possible
over the long term.

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:43.458
And the lessons apply in multiple domains.

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.453
Now, take Turkey's
Gezi Park protests, July 2013,

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:50.490
which I went back to study in the field.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.943
Twitter was key to its organizing.

00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:56.337
It was everywhere in the park --
well, along with a lot of tear gas.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:58.175
It wasn't all high tech.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:02.053
But the people in Turkey had already
gotten used to the power of Twitter

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:05.993
because of an unfortunate incident
about a year before

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:09.785
when military jets had bombed and killed

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.874
34 Kurdish smugglers
near the border region,

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:18.618
and Turkish media completely
censored this news.

00:01:18.618 --> 00:01:20.456
Editors sat in their newsrooms

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:23.355
and waited for the government
to tell them what to do.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.955
One frustrated journalist
could not take this anymore.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.645
He purchased his own plane ticket,

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:29.957
and went to the village
where this had occurred.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:32.623
And he was confronted by this scene:

00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:38.021
a line of coffins coming down a hill,
relatives wailing.

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.462
He later he told me
how overwhelmed he felt,

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:42.183
and didn't know what to do,

00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:44.156
so he took out his phone,

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:45.924
like any one of us might,

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:49.122
and snapped that picture
and tweeted it out.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.849
And voila, that picture went viral

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.237
and broke the censorship
and forced mass media to cover it.

00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:00.418
So when, a year later,
Turkey's Gezi protests happened,

00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:03.140
it started as a protest
about a park being razed,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.443
but became an anti-authoritarian protest.

00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:09.601
It wasn't surprising
that media also censored it,

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.533
but it got a little ridiculous at times.

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.603
When things were so intense,

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:18.998
when CNN International
was broadcasting live from Istanbul,

00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:25.348
CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting
a documentary on penguins.

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.934
Now, I love penguin documentaries,
but that wasn't the news of the day.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:34.231
An angry viewer put his two screens
together and snapped that picture,

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.098
and that one too went viral,

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:40.586
and since then, people call Turkish media
the penguin media. (Laughter)

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.751
But this time, people knew what to do.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.710
They just took out their phones
and looked for actual news.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.174
Better, they knew to go to the park
and take pictures and participate

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:52.125
and share it more on social media.

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:58.675
Digital connectivity was used
for everything from food to donations.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:03.947
Everything was organized partially
with the help of these new technologies.

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:08.153
And using Internet to mobilize
and publicize protests

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.609
actually goes back a long way.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.454
Remember the Zapatistas,

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:17.089
the peasant uprising
in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:22.720
led by the masked, pipe-smoking,
charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.599
That was probably the first movement

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.970
that got global attention
thanks to the Internet.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.338
Or consider Seattle '99,

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:34.141
when a multinational grassroots effort
brought global attention

00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.826
to what was then an obscure organization,
the World Trade Organization,

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:43.367
by also utilizing these digital
technologies to help them organize.

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:45.902
And more recently, movement after movement

00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:48.740
has shaken country after country:

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.872
the Arab uprisings from Bahrain
to Tunisia to Egypt and more;

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:58.744
indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece;
the Gezi Park protests;

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:02.968
Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:07.680
And think of more recent initiatives,
like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.536
Nowadays, a network of tweets
can unleash a global awareness campaign.

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:18.454
A Facebook page can become the hub
of a massive mobilization.

00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:20.224
Amazing.

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:24.538
But think of the moments I just mentioned.

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:29.203
The achievements they were
able to have, their outcomes,

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:34.013
are not really proportional
to the size and energy they inspired.

00:04:34.013 --> 00:04:38.034
The hopes they rightfully raised
are not really matched

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:42.502
by what they were able to have
as a result in the end.

00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.914
And this raises a question:

00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:50.429
As digital technology makes things
easier for movements,

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:54.452
why haven't successful outcomes
become more likely as well?

00:04:54.452 --> 00:05:00.017
In embracing digital platforms
for activism and politics,

00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:04.251
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of doing things the hard way?

00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:05.468
Now, I believe so.

00:05:05.468 --> 00:05:07.273
I believe that the rule of thumb is:

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:12.000
Easier to mobilize does not always mean
easier to achieve gains.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.503
Now, to be clear,

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:18.357
technology does empower in multiple ways.

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:19.817
It's very powerful.

00:05:19.817 --> 00:05:23.863
In Turkey, I watched
four young college students

00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:28.093
organize a countrywide citizen journalism
network called 140Journos

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:32.524
that became the central hub
for uncensored news in the country.

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:37.671
In Egypt, I saw another four young people
use digital connectivity

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:41.518
to organize the supplies and logistics
for 10 field hospitals,

00:05:41.518 --> 00:05:43.529
very large operations,

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.530
during massive clashes
near Tahrir Square in 2011.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.217
And I asked the founder
of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,

00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:59.327
how long it took him to go from when
he had the idea to when he got started.

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:01.686
"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.

00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:04.234
And he had no training
or background in logistics.

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:07.957
Or think of the Occupy movement
which rocked the world in 2011.

00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:09.935
It started with a single email

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:15.176
from a magazine, Adbusters,
to 90,000 subscribers in its list.

00:06:15.176 --> 00:06:18.160
About two months after that first email,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.509
there were in the United States
600 ongoing occupations and protests.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.333
Less than one month after the first
physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:37.174
a global protest was held
in about 82 countries, 950 cities.

00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:39.919
It was one of the largest
global protests ever organized.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:46.606
Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights
Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:52.743
to protest the racially segregated
bus system, which they wanted to boycott.

00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:54.495
They'd been preparing for many years

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:56.561
and decided it was time
to swing into action

00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:58.764
after Rosa Parks was arrested.

00:06:58.764 --> 00:07:00.430
But how do you get the word out --

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.593
tomorrow we're going to
start the boycott --

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:08.001
when you don't have Facebook,
texting, Twitter, none of that?

00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:13.171
So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets

00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:16.364
by sneaking into a university
duplicating room

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:18.905
and working all night, secretly.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:22.398
They then used the 68
African-American organizations

00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:26.365
that criss-crossed the city
to distribute those leaflets by hand.

00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:31.335
And the logistical tasks were daunting,
because these were poor people.

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:33.425
They had to get to work, boycott or no,

00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:36.327
so a massive carpool was organized,

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:38.443
again by meeting.

00:07:38.443 --> 00:07:40.838
No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.

00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:44.407
They had to meet almost all the time
to keep this carpool going.

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:46.679
Today, it would be so much easier.

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:51.667
We could create a database,
available rides and what rides you need,

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.949
have the database coordinate,
and use texting.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.503
We wouldn't have to meet all that much.

00:07:57.503 --> 00:07:59.779
But again, consider this:

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.773
the Civil Rights Movement
in the United States

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:07.267
navigated a minefield
of political dangers,

00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:12.770
faced repression and overcame,
won major policy concessions,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.006
navigated and innovated through risks.

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:19.539
In contrast, three years
after Occupy sparked

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:22.145
that global conversation about inequality,

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:25.970
the policies that fueled it
are still in place.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.115
Europe was also rocked
by anti-austerity protests,

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:33.237
but the continent
didn't shift its direction.

00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:36.173
In embracing these technologies,

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:42.581
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of slow and sustained?

00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:44.450
To understand this,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.573
I went back to Turkey
about a year after the Gezi protests

00:08:47.573 --> 00:08:49.850
and I interviewed a range of people,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.557
from activists to politicians,

00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:58.174
from both the ruling party
and the opposition party and movements.

00:08:58.174 --> 00:09:01.480
I found that the Gezi protesters
were despairing.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.511
They were frustrated,

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.567
and they had achieved much less
than what they had hoped for.

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:09.105
This echoed what I'd been hearing
around the world

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:12.891
from many other protesters
that I'm in touch with.

00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:15.198
And I've come to realize
that part of the problem

00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:21.067
is that today's protests have become
a bit like climbing Mt. Everest

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:23.524
with the help of 60 Sherpas,

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:26.651
and the Internet is our Sherpa.

00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:30.964
What we're doing is taking the fast routes

00:09:30.964 --> 00:09:34.303
and not replacing the benefits
of the slower work.

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:35.999
Because, you see,

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.867
the kind of work that went into organizing

00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:41.650
all those daunting,
tedious logistical tasks

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.279
did not just take care of those tasks,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.954
they also created the kind of organization
that could think together collectively

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.238
and make hard decisions together,

00:09:51.238 --> 00:09:55.175
create consensus and innovate,
and maybe even more crucially,

00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:58.542
keep going together through differences.

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:03.330
So when you see this
March on Washington in 1963,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.014
when you look at that picture,

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:08.355
where this is the march where
Martin Luther King gave his famous

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:11.207
"I have a dream" speech, 1963,

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:15.649
you don't just see a march
and you don't just hear a powerful speech,

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:21.122
you also see the painstaking,
long-term work that can put on that march.

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:22.917
And if you're in power,

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:27.216
you realize you have to take
the capacity signaled by that march,

00:10:27.218 --> 00:10:31.724
not just the march, but the capacity
signaled by that march, seriously.

00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:35.727
In contrast, when you look
at Occupy's global marches

00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:37.369
that were organized in two weeks,

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:38.753
you see a lot of discontent,

00:10:38.753 --> 00:10:42.907
but you don't necessarily see teeth that
can bite over the long term.

00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:47.710
And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement
innovated tactically

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:54.496
from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins
to pickets to marches to freedom rides.

00:10:54.496 --> 00:10:58.311
Today's movements scale up very quickly
without the organizational base

00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:00.900
that can see them through the challenges.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.700
They feel a little like startups
that got very big

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.705
without knowing what to do next,

00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:09.362
and they rarely manage to shift tactically

00:11:09.362 --> 00:11:11.859
because they don't have
the depth of capacity

00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:14.151
to weather such transitions.

00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:18.858
Now, I want to be clear:
The magic is not in the mimeograph.

00:11:19.668 --> 00:11:25.489
It's in that capacity to work together,
think together collectively,

00:11:25.489 --> 00:11:28.671
which can only be built
over time with a lot of work.

00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:30.747
To understand all this,

00:11:30.747 --> 00:11:34.571
I interviewed a top official
from the ruling party in Turkey,

00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:36.739
and I ask him, "How do you do it?"

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:40.442
They too use digital technology
extensively, so that's not it.

00:11:40.442 --> 00:11:42.372
So what's the secret?

00:11:42.372 --> 00:11:43.896
Well, he told me.

00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:50.532
He said the key is
he never took sugar with his tea.

00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:53.593
I said, what has that
got to do with anything?

00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:56.759
Well, he said, his party starts
getting ready for the next election

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.300
the day after the last one,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.281
and he spends all day every day
meeting with voters in their homes,

00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:04.863
in their wedding parties,
circumcision ceremonies,

00:12:04.863 --> 00:12:07.818
and then he meets with his colleagues
to compare notes.

00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:12.384
With that many meetings every day,
with tea offered at every one of them,

00:12:12.384 --> 00:12:15.736
which he could not refuse,
because that would be rude,

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:20.379
he could not take even one cube of sugar
per cup of tea,

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:24.335
because that would be many kilos of sugar,
he can't even calculate how many kilos,

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:27.979
and at that point I realized
why he was speaking so fast.

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.230
We had met in the afternoon,
and he was already way over-caffeinated.

00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:37.000
But his party won two major elections

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.658
within a year of the Gezi protests
with comfortable margins.

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:43.997
To be sure, governments have
different resources to bring to the table.

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:47.147
It's not the same game,
but the differences are instructive.

00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:51.009
And like all such stories, this is not
a story just of technology.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:56.091
It's what technology allows us to do
converging with what we want to do.

00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:59.877
Today's social movements
want to operate informally.

00:12:59.877 --> 00:13:02.147
They do not want institutional leadership.

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:07.013
They want to stay out of politics because
they fear corruption and cooptation.

00:13:07.013 --> 00:13:08.546
They have a point.

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:11.961
Modern representative democracies
are being strangled in many countries

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:13.604
by powerful interests.

00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:17.518
But operating this way
makes it hard for them

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:21.268
to sustain over the long term
and exert leverage over the system,

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:24.530
which leads to frustrated
protesters dropping out,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.889
and even more corrupt politics.

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:32.977
And politics and democracy
without an effective challenge hobbles,

00:13:32.977 --> 00:13:39.370
because the causes that have inspired
the modern recent movements are crucial.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.465
Climate change is barreling towards us.

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:47.348
Inequality is stifling human growth
and potential and economies.

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:49.633
Authoritarianism is choking
many countries.

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:52.384
We need movements to be more effective.

00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:55.062
Now, some people have argued
that the problem is

00:13:55.062 --> 00:14:01.521
today's movements are not formed of people
who take as many risks as before,

00:14:01.521 --> 00:14:03.569
and that is not true.

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:06.131
From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,

00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:09.769
I've seen people put their lives
and livelihoods on the line.

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:12.188
It's also not true,
as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,

00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:14.930
that today's protesters
form weaker virtual ties.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.721
No, they come to these protests,
just like before,

00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:21.333
with their friends, existing networks,

00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:23.635
and sometimes they do
make new friends for life.

00:14:23.635 --> 00:14:26.221
I still see the friends that I made

00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:29.643
in those Zapatista-convened
global protests more than a decade ago,

00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:32.615
and the bonds between strangers
are not worthless.

00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:34.899
When I got tear-gassed in Gezi,

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:40.171
people I didn't know helped me
and one another instead of running away.

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.398
In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,

00:14:43.398 --> 00:14:46.208
working really hard to keep
each other safe and protected.

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:48.097
And digital awareness-raising is great,

00:14:48.097 --> 00:14:51.816
because changing minds
is the bedrock of changing politics.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:59.216
But movements today have to move beyond
participation at great scale very fast

00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:02.715
and figure out how
to think together collectively,

00:15:02.715 --> 00:15:06.456
develop strong policy proposals,
create consensus,

00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:10.130
figure out the political steps
and relate them to leverage,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.813
because all these good intentions
and bravery and sacrifice by itself

00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:15.485
are not going to be enough.

00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:17.381
And there are many efforts.

00:15:17.381 --> 00:15:21.770
In New Zealand, a group of young people
are developing a platform called Loomio

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.771
for participatory
decision making at scale.

00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:28.046
In Turkey, 140Journos
are holding hack-a-thons

00:15:28.046 --> 00:15:31.879
so that they support communities
as well as citizen journalism.

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:35.725
In Argentina, an open-source platform
called DemocracyOS

00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:39.133
is bringing participation
to parliaments and political parties.

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:42.518
These are all great, and we need more,

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:46.694
but the answer won't just be
better online decision-making,

00:15:46.694 --> 00:15:52.247
because to update democracy, we are going
to need to innovate at every level,

00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:56.740
from the organizational
to the political to the social.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.692
Because to succeed over the long term,

00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:03.064
sometimes you do need tea without sugar

00:16:03.064 --> 00:16:04.697
along with your Twitter.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.209
Thank you.

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:13.010
(Applause)
