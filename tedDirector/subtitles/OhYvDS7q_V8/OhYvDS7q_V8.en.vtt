00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It is actually a reality today

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that you can download products from the Web --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
product data, I should say, from the Web --

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
perhaps tweak it and personalize it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
to your own preference or your own taste,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and have that information sent

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to a desktop machine

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
that will fabricate it for you on the spot.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
We can actually build for you,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
very rapidly,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
a physical object.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And the reason we can do this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
is through an emerging technology

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
called additive manufacturing,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
or 3D printing.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
This is a 3D printer.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
They have been around

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
for almost 30 years now,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
which is quite amazing to think of,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but they're only just starting

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
to filter into the public arena.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And typically, you would take data,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
like the data of a pen here,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and we would pass that data with material

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
into a machine.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And a process that would happen in the machine

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
would mean layer by layer that product would be built.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And we can take out the physical product,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and ready to use,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
why don't we know about them?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Because typically they've been too inefficient,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
inaccessible,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
they've not been fast enough,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
they've been quite expensive.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But today,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
it is becoming a reality

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
that they are now becoming successful.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Many barriers are breaking down.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
That means that you guys

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
will soon be able to access one of these machines,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
if not this minute.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And it will change and disrupt

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
the landscape of manufacturing,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and most certainly our lives, our businesses

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and the lives of our children.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So how does it work?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
It typically reads CAD data,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
which is a product design data

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
created on professional product design programs.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And here you can see an engineer --

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
create a product in 3D.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And this data gets sent to a machine

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that slices the data

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
into two-dimensional representations of that product

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
all the way through --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
almost like slicing it like salami.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
starting at the base of the product

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and depositing material, layer upon layer,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
in an additive process.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And this material that's deposited

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
either starts as a liquid form

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
or a material powder form.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And the bonding process can happen

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
It's actually using a laser

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And over time --

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
we can build a physical product,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
ready to take out of the machine and use.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And this is quite an extraordinary idea,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
but it is reality today.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So all these products that you can see on the screen

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
were made in the same way.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
They were all 3D printed.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And you can see,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
they're ranging from shoes,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
rings that were made out of stainless steal,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
phone covers out of plastic,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
all the way through to spinal implants, for example,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
that were created out of medical-grade titanium,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and engine parts.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
But what you'll notice about all of these products

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
is they're very, very intricate.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
The design is quite extraordinary.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Because we're taking this data in 3D form,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
slicing it up before it gets past the machine,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
we can actually create structures

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that are more intricate

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
than any other manufacturing technology --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And you can create parts with moving components,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
hinges, parts within parts.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
So in some cases, we can abolish totally

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
the need for manual labor.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
It sounds great.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
It is great.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
We can have 3D printers today

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
that build structures like these.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
This is almost three meters high.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And this was built

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
slowly growing this structure.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And you can actually walk into it.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
And on the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
this is a microstructure.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
It's created depositing layers

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
of about four microns.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
So really the resolution is quite incredible.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
The detail that you can get today

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
is quite amazing.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So who's using it?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
it's been used by product designers,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
or anyone who wanted to prototype a product

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and very quickly create or reiterate a design.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
is that you can create bespoke products en masse.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
There's very little economies of scale.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
So you can now create one-offs very easily.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Architects, for example,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
they want to create prototypes of buildings.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Again you can see,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
this is a building of the Free University in Berlin

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and it was designed by Foster and Partners.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Again, not buildable in any other way.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And very hard to even create this by hand.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Now this is an engine component.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
It was developed by a company called Within Technologies

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and 3T RPD.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
It's very, very, very detailed

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
inside with the design.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
Now 3D printing

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
can break away barriers in design

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
which challenge the constraints

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
of mass production.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
which means it's a more efficient product.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
even if you tried to do it manually.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It's more efficient

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
because we can now create all these cavities within the object

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that cool fluid.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And it's used by aerospace

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and automotive.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
It's a lighter part

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and it uses less material waste.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
So it's overall performance and efficiency

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
just exceeds standard mass produced products.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
And then taking this idea

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
of creating a very detailed structure,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
we can apply it to honeycomb structures

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
and use them within implants.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
Typically an implant

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
is more effective within the body

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
if it's more porous,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
because our body tissue will grow into it.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
There's a lower chance of rejection.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
With 3D printing,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
we're seeing today

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
that we can create much better implants.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And in fact, because we can create

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
bespoke products en masse, one-offs,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
we can create implants

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
that are specific to individuals.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
So as you can see,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.260
this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
And we're starting to see it being used

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
for final end products.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And in fact, as the detail is improving,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
the quality is improving,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
the price of the machines are falling

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and they're becoming quicker.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
They're also now small enough

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
to sit on a desktop.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
You can buy a machine today for about $300

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
that you can create yourself,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
which is quite incredible.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
But then it begs the question,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
why don't we all have one in our home?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Because, simply, most of us here today

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
don't know how to create the data

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
that a 3D printer reads.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
If I gave you a 3D printer,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
you wouldn't know how to direct it

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
to make what you want it to.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
But there are more and more

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
technologies, software and processes today

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
that are breaking down those barriers.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
I believe we're at a tipping point

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
where this is now something

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
that we can't avoid.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
This technology

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
is really going to disrupt

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
the landscape of manufacturing

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and, I believe, cause a revolution

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
in manufacturing.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So today,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
you can download products from the Web --

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
anything you would have on your desktop,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
You can use software like Google SketchUp

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
to create products from scratch

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
very easily.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
3D printing can be also used

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
to download spare parts from the Web.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
So imagine you have, say,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
a Hoover in your home

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and it has broken down. You need a spare part,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Can you imagine going online --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
this is a reality --

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and finding that spare part

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
from a database of geometries

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
of that discontinued product

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and downloading that information, that data,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
and having the product made for you at home,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
ready to use, on your demand?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
And in fact, because we can create spare parts

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
with things the machines

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
are quite literally making themselves.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
You're having machines fabricate themselves.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
These are parts of a RepRap machine,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
which is a kind of desktop printer.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
But what interests my company the most

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
is the fact that you can create

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
individual unique products en masse.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
There's no need to do a run

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
of thousands of millions

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
or send that product to be injection molded in China.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
You can just make it physically on the spot.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Which means

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that we can now present to the public

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
the next generation of customization.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
This is something that is now possible today,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
that you can direct personally

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
how you want your products to look.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
We're all familiar with the idea

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
of customization or personalization.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Brands like Nike are doing it.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
It's all over the Web.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
In fact, every major household name

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
is allowing you

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
to interact with their products

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
on a daily basis --

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
all the way from Smart Cars

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
to Prada

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
to Ray Ban, for example.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
But this is not really mass customization;

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
it's known as variant production,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
variations of the same product.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
What you could do is really influence your product now

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and shape-manipulate your product.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
I'm not sure about you guys,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
but I've had experiences

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
that I know where I want to sit in my house

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
and I just can't find the right thing,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
or that perfect piece of jewelry

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
as a gift or for myself.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Imagine that you can now

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
engage with a brand

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and interact,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
so that you can pass your personal attributes

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.260
to the products that you're about to buy.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
You can today

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
download a product with software like this,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
view the product in 3D.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
This is the sort of 3D data

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
that a machine will read.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
This is a lamp.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And you can start iterating the design.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
You can direct what color that product will be,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
perhaps what material.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
but within boundaries that are safe.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
The piece of software will keep an individual

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
within the bounds of the possible.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
in their personalized design,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
they click "Enter" and this data gets converted

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.260
into the data that a 3D printer reads

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and gets passed to a 3D printer,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
perhaps on someone's desktop.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
But I don't think that that's immediate.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
I don't think that will happen soon.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
is that data gets sent

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
to a local manufacturing center.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
This means lower carbon footprint.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
we're sending data across the Internet.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Here's the product being built.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and the electronics were inserted later.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It's this lamp, as you can see here.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
So as long as you have the data,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
you can create the part on demand.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And you don't necessarily need to use this

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
for just aesthetic customization,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
you can use it for functional customization,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
scanning parts of the body

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
and creating things that are made to fit.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Or we can create very specific prosthetics

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
for that individual.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
Scanning teeth today,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
you can have your teeth scanned

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
While you wait at the dentist,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
a machine will quietly be creating this for you

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
ready to insert in the teeth.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.260
And the idea of now creating implants,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
can now be converted into 3D data

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and we can create very specific implants for them.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And applying this

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
It's very intricate.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
But with MRI data,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
we can just build the product,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
as you can see, very intricately.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Using this process,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
and he has been working

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
on layering cells to create body parts --

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.260
bladders, valves, kidneys.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Now this is not something that's ready for the public,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
but it is in working progress.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
So just to finalize, we're all individual.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
We all have different preferences, different needs.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
We like different things.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
We're all different sizes and our companies the same.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Businesses want different things.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
Without a doubt in my mind,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
I believe that this technology

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
is going to cause a manufacturing revolution

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Thank you.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.260
(Applause)
