00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
and I realized that I almost became a scientist.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
and I decided to make water.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.160
(Laughter)

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
and I threw a match in.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
(Laughter)

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
And the glass -- luckily I turned around --

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
I had it all in my back

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
and I was about 15 feet away.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
The wall was covered with ...

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I had an explosion.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
to see if I was okay.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.160
RSW: ... huh. (Laughter)

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
I'd like to start

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
this session again.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.160
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
Frank Gehry.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160
(Laughter)

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
(Applause)

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
but your building is an icon --

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
And I know the road was extremely difficult.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
whatever they were, were very big.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.160
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
on working for somebody.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
A lot of us work for people;

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
we're in the hands of other people.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
And you've achieved that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160
and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
It's a big issue.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
FG: Well, I've always just ...

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I've never really gone out looking for work.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
And when I started out,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I thought that architecture was a service business

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
and that you had to please the clients and stuff.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.160
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160
with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
and people would just look at me

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
like I'd just landed from Mars.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
But I couldn't do anything else.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
That was my response to the people in the time.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
I think it was circumstantial.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And a few people got excited about it.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
He's building this huge concrete place.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
We were standing out in the desert all alone and,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
thinking about my house, he said,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.160
"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
(Laughter)

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
so the stuff was a little more permanent.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
this guy was telling us the other day.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
So where do we go now?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
Back to -- everything's so temporary.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.160
I don't see it the way you characterized it.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
For me, every day is a new thing.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.160
I approach each project with a new insecurity,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
almost like the first project I ever did,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.160
and I get the sweats,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
I discard it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
So I approach it with the same trepidation.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
that it's going to be OK.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
I do run a kind of a business --

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
I've got 120 people

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
and you've got to pay them,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
so there's a lot of responsibility involved --

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.160
but the actual work on the project is with,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
I think, a healthy insecurity.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.160
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him:

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
you're not sure.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
They weren't mistakes;

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
I saw everything that I would have changed

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
and I was embarrassed by it.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.160
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.160
as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
and the street, and it appears to have a relationship --

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
that I started to like it.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
FG: I don't really know.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
and I thought he was nuts.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
I didn't think he knew what he was doing,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
and he pulled it off.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
(Laughter)

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
They're still talking about it.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.160
September 11 generated some interest

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
in moving it over to Ground Zero,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.160
and I'm totally against that.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:22.160
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
I think for a long time.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
RSW: The picture on the screen,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
is that Disney?

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160
FG: Yeah.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
RSW: How much further along is it than that,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and when will that be finished?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.160
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:48.160
and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
come play with us at that place.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
that Disney Hall came to me.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.160
There aren't many people around that are really involved

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
with architecture as clients.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160
If you think about the world,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
and even just in this audience,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.160
most of us are involved with buildings.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160
And so to find one, a guy like that,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.160
you hang on to him.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
He's become the head of Art Center,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
I knew Craig and respected him.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
They want to add to it

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160
and it's hard to add to a building like that --

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --

00:08:51.160 --> 00:09:00.160
and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
and it's a lot of acreage.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160
RSW: Why did you want that?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
FG: I knew you'd ask that question.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
It was intuitive.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
(Laughter)

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
I visited with him a few years ago

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
and he showed me his early work,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
When I came out of college,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.160
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and things like that.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.160
I tried to understand that language as a beginning,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
as a place to jump off,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160
and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
I just stopped.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
but it didn't feel good to me.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.160
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
where the real stuff was

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.160
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160
and do a building.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.160
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.160
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.160
because it pushes you.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160
who doesn't think architecture is art.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
Did you see that thing?

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
RSW: No. What did he say?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.160
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
(Laughter)

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.160
FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
It's a richer experience.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
it's similar to that I would imagine --

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160
where you ... huh?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
Audience: Liquid architecture.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
FG: Liquid architecture.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160
(Laughter)

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.160
you play off each other, you make something,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160
they make something.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
And I think

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.160
for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
and what might happen in the city.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
Or is it going to be down near ...

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
FG: No, it's near the current campus.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160
It's not his money, of course.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
(Laughter)

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
RSW: What's his schedule on that?

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160
FG: I don't know.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160
What's the schedule, Richard?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
FG: 2004.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:35.160
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
because it creates chaos, right?

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
and if you can figure out how to work off each other --

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.160
if you can get a bunch of people

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
who respect each other's work and play off each other,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
you might be able to create models for

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:06.160
how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
Like the Rockefeller Center model,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
which is kind of from another era.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.160
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.160
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160
That was the surprise of going across the river,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
of going on the highway around it,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
of walking down the street and finding it.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.160
FG: But you know, Richard,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
most architects when they present their work --

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160
most of the people we know,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
you get up and you talk about your work,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.160
and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.160
by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
I'm worried about the city,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.160
I'm worried about my client,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
I worry about budget, that I'm on time."

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.160
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.160
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
And I think everybody --

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160
You're not going to defy gravity.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
You've got to work with the building department.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
If it leaks --

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
Bilbao did not leak.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
I was so proud.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.160
(Laughter)

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.160
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
I met them in Bilbao.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160
They came for three days.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
RSW: This is the computer building?

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160
FG: Yeah, the computer building.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
They were there three days and it rained every day

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
and they kept walking around --

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
I noticed they were looking under things

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
and looking for things,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.160
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
People put buckets out ...

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
it was just fantastic.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
But you've got to --

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.160
(Laughter)

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160
RSW: Frank had a sort of ...

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160
FG: Ask Miriam!

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
(Laughter)

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
when the woman called and said,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.160
"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
and the water's pouring in on my head."

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.160
(Laughter)

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160
So, some years later I was doing a building,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160
a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.160
and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
called me and said,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
and the water's coming in on his head."

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
FG: No. Not now either.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.160
(Laughter)

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.160
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
OK, you solved all the problems,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
you did all the stuff, you made nice,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.160
you loved your clients,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.160
you loved the city,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
you're a good guy, you're a good person ...

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
and then what?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
What do you bring to it?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160
And I think that's what I've always been interested in,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:58.160
is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.160
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
that kind of personal expression

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
and still touch all the bases that are necessary

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
of fitting into the city.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
That's what reminded me of it.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
And I think that's the issue, you know;

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160
it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.160
most clients aren't hiring architects for that.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.160
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.160
be polite,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:49.160
and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people --

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:59.160
when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.160
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.160
(Laughter)

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160
RSW: Did it leak?

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160
FG: No.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.160
(Laughter)

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.160
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.160
FG: Yeah.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.160
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
both Krens and I have been called

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.160
with at least 100 opportunities --

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:50.160
China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.160
to come in and do the Bilbao effect.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160
And I've met with some of these people.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.160
Usually I say no right away,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.160
but some of them come with pedigree

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.160
and they sound well-intentioned

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160
and they get you for at least one or two meetings.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.160
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.160
because the thing was signed with seals and various

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.160
very official seals from the city,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.160
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
I asked them what kind of building it was.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
So four of us went.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.160
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160
and we were looking over the bay,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.160
and then they took us in a boat out in the water

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.160
and showed us all these sights in the harbor.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.160
Each one was more beautiful than the other.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.160
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160
and we were going to have dinner with

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.160
the most important people in Malaga.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.160
Just before going to lunch with the mayor,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
we went to the harbor commissioner.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160
It was a table as long as this carpet

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.160
and the harbor commissioner was here,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.160
and I was here, and my guys.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160
We sat down, and we had a drink of water

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.160
and everybody was quiet.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
And the guy looked at me and said,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.160
"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.160
(Laughter)

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.160
RSW: Oh, my God.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160
FG: So, I got up.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160
I said to my team,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.160
"Let's get out of here."

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.160
We stood up, we walked out.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.160
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.160
"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.160
I said, "Nope."

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.160
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.160
They just brought us there to hustle this group,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
you know, to create a project.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
And we get a lot of that.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
Luckily, I'm old enough that

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.160
I can complain I can't travel.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160
(Laughter)

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.160
I don't have my own plane yet.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160
because it's been very long.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
But let me just say a couple words.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
FG: Can I say something?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.160
Are you going to talk about me or you?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160
(Laughter)

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160
(Applause)

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.160
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.160
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.160
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160
(Laughter)

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.160
I'm going to make it for you!

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.160
(Applause)
