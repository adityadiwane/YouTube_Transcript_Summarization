00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
This is Alex, the best computer voice

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
I've been able to find,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
For most of my life,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It was like breathing.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
After surgeries for cancer

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I was forced to enter this virtual world

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
in which a computer does some of my living for me.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
For several days now,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
I used to be able to talk like that.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Maybe I wasn't as smart,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but I was at least as talkative.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I want to devote my talk today

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
to the act of speaking itself,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and how the act of speaking or not speaking

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
is tied so indelibly to one's identity

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
as to force the birth of a new person

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
when it is taken away.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
However, I've found that listening to a computer voice

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
for any great length of time

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
can be monotonous.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
to read my words aloud for me.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I will start with my wife, Chaz.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.260
through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and restore my ability to speak.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Going into the first surgery

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
for a recurrence of salivary cancer

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
in 2006,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I expected to be out of the hospital

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in time to return to my movie review show,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.'

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I had pre-taped enough shows

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to get me through six weeks of surgery

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and recuperation.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and some tissue from my shoulder

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
to fashion into a new jaw.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
My tongue, larynx and vocal cords

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
were still healthy and unaffected.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
(Laughter)

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.260
(Laughter)

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
CE: I was optimistic,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and all was right with the world.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
The first surgery was a great success.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I saw myself in the mirror

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and I looked pretty good.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
I was using my iPod

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
to play the Leonard Cohen song

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
'I'm Your Man'

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
for my doctors and nurses.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
My carotid artery had ruptured.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Thank God I was still in my hospital room

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and my doctors were right there.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Chaz told me

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
that if that song hadn't played for so long,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I might have already been in the car, on the way home,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and would have died right there and then.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So thank you, Leonard Cohen,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
for saving my life.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.260
(Applause)

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
There was a second surgery --

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
which held up for five or six days

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and then it also fell apart.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And then a third attempt,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
which also patched me back together pretty well,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
until it failed.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
A doctor from Brazil said

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
he had never seen anyone survive

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
a carotid artery rupture.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And before I left the hospital,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
after a year of being hospitalized,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
I had seven ruptures

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
of my carotid artery.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
There was no particular day

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
when anyone told me

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
I would never speak again;

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
it just sort of became obvious.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Human speech

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
is an ingenious manipulation of our breath

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
within the sound chamber of our mouth

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and respiratory system.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
in order to form sounds.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Therefore, the system

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
must be essentially airtight

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
in order to capture air.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Because I had lost my jaw,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
I could no longer form a seal,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and therefore my tongue

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and all of my other vocal equipment

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
was rendered powerless.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
I wrote messages in notebooks.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Then I tried typing words on my laptop

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and using its built in voice.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
This was faster,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
I tried out various computer voices that were available online,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
and for several months I had a British accent,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
which Chaz called Sir Lawrence."

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
(Laughter)

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
"It was the clearest I could find.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Then Apple released the Alex voice,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
which was the best I'd heard.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
It knew things like the difference

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
between an exclamation point and a question mark.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.260
sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
There are all sorts of html codes you can use

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and I've experimented with them.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
When I find myself in a conversational situation,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
I need to type fast and to jump right in.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
People don't have the time or the patience

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to wait for me to fool around with the codes

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
for every word or phrase.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
How does that affect who you are as a person?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
When people hear Alex speaking my words,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
do they experience a disconnect?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Does that create a separation or a distance

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
from one person to the next?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
How did I feel not being able to speak?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
I felt, and I still feel,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
a lot of distance from the human mainstream.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
for my speaking difficulties.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
using my TV show voice

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
from a period of 30 years.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
At first I was against it.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I thought it would be creepy

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
to hear my own voice coming from a computer.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But I decided then to just give it a try.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
So we contacted a company in Scotland

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
that created personalized computer voices.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
All of their voices had been made by a speaker

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
recording original words in a control booth.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But they were willing to give it a try.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
including several audio commentary tracks

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
that I'd made for movies on DVDs.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And it sounded like me, it really did.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
There was a reason for that; it was me.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
But it wasn't that simple.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
because there were too many other kinds of audio involved --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
(Laughter)

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
and my words often had a particular emphasis

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
that didn't fit into a sentence well enough.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
I'll let you hear a sample of that voice.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And here's the voice we call Roger Jr.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
or Roger 2.0.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
to be back on your show.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
We have been talking for a long time,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
and now here we are again.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
This is the first version of my computer voice.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
It still needs improvement,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
but at least it sounds like me

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
and not like HAL 9000.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
When I heard it the first time,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
it sent chills down my spine.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
When I type anything,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
this voice will speak whatever I type.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
When I read something, it will read in my voice.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
I have typed these words in advance,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
as I didn't think it would be thrilling

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
to sit here watching me typing.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
The voice was created by a company in Scotland

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
named CereProc.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
It makes me feel good

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
while I was commenting on "Casablanca"

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and "Citizen Kane."

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
This is the first voice they've created for an individual.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
There are several very good voices available for computers,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
but they all sound like somebody else,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
while this voice sounds like me.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I plan to use it on television, radio

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and the Internet.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
People who need a voice should know

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Many blind people use them

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
to read pages on the Web to themselves.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
But I've got to say, in first grade,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
they said I talked too much,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and now I still can.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Laughter)

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
but the words jump up and down.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
The flow isn't natural.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
and I'm optimistic about it.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
But so far, the Apple Alex voice

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
is the best one I've heard.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
I wrote a blog about it

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to be used in the voice.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
A very large sample is needed.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Now I have spoken my last words,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and I don't even remember for sure

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
what they were.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.260
titled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
what a tiny instant the human race represents

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
in the time-span of the universe.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
For almost all of its millions and billions of years,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
there was no life on Earth at all.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
For almost all the years of life on Earth,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
there was no intelligent life.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Only after we learned to pass knowledge

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
from one generation to the next,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
did civilization become possible.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
In cosmological terms,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that was about 10 minutes ago.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
the computer.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
That has mostly happened in my lifetime.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
Some of the famous early computers

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
were being built in my hometown of Urbana,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the birthplace of HAL 9000.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
When I heard the amazing talk

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
by Salman Khan on Wednesday,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
about the Khan Academy website

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
I had a flashback.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
It was about 1960.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
to interview the creators

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
of something called PLATO.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
The initials stood for Programmed Logic

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.260
for Automated Teaching Operations.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
This was a computer-assisted instruction system,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.260
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
I doubt, on that day 50 years ago,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
But that's not the point.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
an instant in time.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
on more and more sophisticated computers,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
until only five years ago.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I have learned from Wikipedia

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that, starting with that humble beginning,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
PLATO established forums, message boards,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
online testing,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
email, chat rooms,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
picture languages, instant messaging,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
remote screen sharing

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
and multiple-player games.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
it appears that my hometown

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
in downstate Illinois

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
was the birthplace

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
(Laughter)

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I'm here as a man who wants to communicate.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
All of this has happened in my lifetime.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
when one of the first Atech systems was installed

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
I was in line at Radio Shack

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
to buy one of the first Model 100's.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
they didn't know what I was talking about.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
When I bought my first desktop,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
it was a DEC Rainbow.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Does anybody remember that?"

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
(Applause)

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.260
with a portable computer the size of a suitcase

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
named the Porteram Telebubble.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
I joined CompuServe

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
when it had fewer numbers

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
than I currently have followers on Twitter.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
(Laughter)

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
CE: All of this has happened

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
in the blink of an eye.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
It is unimaginable

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
what will happen next.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
It makes me incredibly fortunate

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
to live at this moment in history.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
because without intelligence and memory

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
there is no history.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
For billions of years,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
the universe evolved

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
completely without notice.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Now we live in the age of the Internet,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
And because of it,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
I can communicate

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
as well as I ever could.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
We are born into a box

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
of time and space.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
We use words and communication

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
to break out of it

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
and to reach out to others.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
For me, the Internet began

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
as a useful tool

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
and now has become something I rely on

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
for my actual daily existence.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
I cannot speak;

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
I can only type so fast.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Computer voices

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
are sometimes not very sophisticated,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
but with my computer,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
I can communicate more widely

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
than ever before.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
I feel as if my blog,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
my email, Twitter and Facebook

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
have given me a substitute

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
for everyday conversation.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
They aren't an improvement,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
but they're the best I can do.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
They give me a way to speak.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Not everybody has the patience

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
of my wife, Chaz.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.260
But online,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
everybody speaks at the same speed.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
This whole adventure

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
has been a learning experience.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Every time there was a surgery that failed,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
I was left with a little less flesh and bone.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Now I have no jaw left at all.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
the surgeries left me with back pain

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.260
and reduced my ability to walk easily.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Ironic that my legs are fine,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
When you see me today,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
I look like the Phantom of the Opera.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
But no you don't.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Laughter)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:37.260
(Applause)

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
It is human nature to look at someone like me

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and assume I have lost some of my marbles.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
People --

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:03.260
(Applause)

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
People talk loudly --

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
I'm so sorry.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
Excuse me.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260
(Applause)

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.260
People talk loudly and slowly to me.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Sometimes they assume I am deaf.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
There are people who don't want to make eye contact.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
Believe me, he didn't mean this as --

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
anyway, let me just read it.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
(Laughter)

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
You should never let your wife read something like this.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.260
(Laughter)

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
It is human nature

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
to look away from illness.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
We don't enjoy a reminder

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
of our own fragile mortality.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
That's why writing on the Internet

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
has become a lifesaver for me.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
My ability to think and write

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
have not been affected.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
And on the Web, my real voice finds expression.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I have also met many other disabled people

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
who communicate this way.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
One of my Twitter friends

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
can type only with his toes.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
One of the funniest blogs on the Web

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260
is written by a friend of mine

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
named Smartass Cripple.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
(Laughter)

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Google him and he will make you laugh.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
All of these people are saying, in one way or another,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
that what you see

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
is not all you get.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
So I have not come here to complain.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
I have much to make me happy and relieved.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
I seem, for the time being,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
to be cancer-free.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
I am writing as well as ever.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
I am productive.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
If I were in this condition at any point

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
before a few cosmological instants ago,

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
I would be as isolated as a hermit.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
I would be trapped inside my head.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
Because of the rush of human knowledge,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
because of the digital revolution,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
I have a voice,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.260
and I do not need to scream.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.260
RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
A guy goes into a psychiatrist.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260
The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.260
The guy says, "I want a second opinion."

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.260
The psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly."

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
(Laughter)

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.260
You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
A human judge has a conversation

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.260
with a human and a computer.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
the machine has passed the test.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.260
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
then that's the voice I want.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:19:23.260
(Applause)
