Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.325
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.339
CA: It feels like the world is in a place

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:20.200
that we haven't seen for a long time.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:24.785
People don't just disagree
in the way that we're familiar with,

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.709
on the left-right political divide.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.734
There are much deeper differences afoot.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.024
What on earth is going on,
and how did we get here?

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:36.051
JH: This is different.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:39.302
There's a much more
apocalyptic sort of feeling.

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:41.652
Survey research by Pew Research shows

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:45.385
that the degree to which we feel
that the other side is not just --

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.383
we don't just dislike them;
we strongly dislike them,

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:51.883
and we think that they are
a threat to the nation.

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.871
Those numbers have been going up and up,

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:56.632
and those are over 50 percent
now on both sides.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.807
People are scared,

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.458
because it feels like this is different
than before; it's much more intense.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:04.002
Whenever I look
at any sort of social puzzle,

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:07.143
I always apply the three basic
principles of moral psychology,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.061
and I think they'll help us here.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:11.818
So the first thing that you
have to always keep in mind

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.578
when you're thinking about politics

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:14.982
is that we're tribal.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.529
We evolved for tribalism.

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:19.722
One of the simplest and greatest
insights into human social nature

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.919
is the Bedouin proverb:

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:22.335
"Me against my brother;

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.286
me and my brother against our cousin;

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.812
me and my brother and cousins
against the stranger."

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:31.560
And that tribalism allowed us
to create large societies

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:34.616
and to come together
in order to compete with others.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.321
That brought us out of the jungle
and out of small groups,

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.368
but it means that we have
eternal conflict.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.133
The question you have to look at is:

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:44.821
What aspects of our society
are making that more bitter,

00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:46.375
and what are calming them down?

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.960
CA: That's a very dark proverb.

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:52.157
You're saying that that's actually
baked into most people's mental wiring

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.332
at some level?

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:57.160
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
a basic aspect of human social cognition.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:59.507
But we can also live together
really peacefully,

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.926
and we've invented all kinds
of fun ways of, like, playing war.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.332
I mean, sports, politics --

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:08.051
these are all ways that we get
to exercise this tribal nature

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:09.658
without actually hurting anyone.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:14.027
We're also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:17.350
So you have to see our tribalism
as something that goes up or down --

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:20.226
it's not like we're doomed
to always be fighting each other,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.100
but we'll never have world peace.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.202
CA: The size of that tribe
can shrink or expand.

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:27.377
JH: Right.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.388
CA: The size of what we consider "us"

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:31.833
and what we consider "other" or "them"

00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:33.987
can change.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.200
And some people believed that process
could continue indefinitely.

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:41.416
JH: That's right.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.646
CA: And we were indeed expanding
the sense of tribe for a while.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.831
JH: So this is, I think,

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:49.210
where we're getting at what's possibly
the new left-right distinction.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:51.557
I mean, the left-right
as we've all inherited it,

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:54.420
comes out of the labor
versus capital distinction,

00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:56.819
and the working class, and Marx.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.092
But I think what we're seeing
now, increasingly,

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:01.970
is a divide in all the Western democracies

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.701
between the people
who want to stop at nation,

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:07.475
the people who are more parochial --

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.296
and I don't mean that in a bad way --

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.120
people who have much more
of a sense of being rooted,

00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:15.337
they care about their town,
their community and their nation.

00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:19.861
And then those who are
anti-parochial and who --

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:23.285
whenever I get confused, I just think
of the John Lennon song "Imagine."

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.138
"Imagine there's no countries,
nothing to kill or die for."

00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:29.375
And so these are the people
who want more global governance,

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.073
they don't like nation states,
they don't like borders.

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:33.922
You see this all over Europe as well.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:37.172
There's a great metaphor guy --
actually, his name is Shakespeare --

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.777
writing ten years ago in Britain.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.968
He had a metaphor:

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:43.265
"Are we drawbridge-uppers
or drawbridge-downers?"

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.194
And Britain is divided
52-48 on that point.

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:48.338
And America is divided on that point, too.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.956
CA: And so, those of us
who grew up with The Beatles

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.554
and that sort of hippie philosophy
of dreaming of a more connected world --

00:03:56.578 --> 00:04:00.419
it felt so idealistic and "how could
anyone think badly about that?"

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.747
And what you're saying is that, actually,

00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:07.073
millions of people today
feel that that isn't just silly;

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.958
it's actually dangerous and wrong,
and they're scared of it.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.008
JH: I think the big issue, especially
in Europe but also here,

00:04:13.032 --> 00:04:14.399
is the issue of immigration.

00:04:14.423 --> 00:04:17.492
And I think this is where
we have to look very carefully

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:21.147
at the social science
about diversity and immigration.

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:22.885
Once something becomes politicized,

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.933
once it becomes something
that the left loves and the right --

00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:29.058
then even the social scientists
can't think straight about it.

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:31.039
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:33.270
It clearly creates more innovation.

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:35.771
The American economy
has grown enormously from it.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.177
Diversity and immigration
do a lot of good things.

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.829
But what the globalists,
I think, don't see,

00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:42.360
what they don't want to see,

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:48.662
is that ethnic diversity
cuts social capital and trust.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.022
There's a very important
study by Robert Putnam,

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:52.902
the author of "Bowling Alone,"

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.781
looking at social capital databases.

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:57.752
And basically, the more people
feel that they are the same,

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:59.283
the more they trust each other,

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.047
the more they can have
a redistributionist welfare state.

00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:04.042
Scandinavian countries are so wonderful

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.415
because they have this legacy
of being small, homogenous countries.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.156
And that leads to
a progressive welfare state,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.983
a set of progressive
left-leaning values, which says,

00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:17.008
"Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.

00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:20.064
People in Syria are suffering --
we must welcome them in."

00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:21.465
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.517
But if, and I was in Sweden
this summer,

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.724
if the discourse in Sweden
is fairly politically correct

00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:29.985
and they can't talk about the downsides,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.996
you end up bringing a lot of people in.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.712
That's going to cut social capital,

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:35.681
it makes it hard to have a welfare state

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.261
and they might end up,
as we have in America,

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:41.898
with a racially divided, visibly
racially divided, society.

00:05:41.922 --> 00:05:44.182
So this is all very
uncomfortable to talk about.

00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:47.451
But I think this is the thing,
especially in Europe and for us, too,

00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:48.668
we need to be looking at.

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:50.778
CA: You're saying that people of reason,

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:53.290
people who would consider
themselves not racists,

00:05:53.314 --> 00:05:55.041
but moral, upstanding people,

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.011
have a rationale that says
humans are just too different;

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:03.474
that we're in danger of overloading
our sense of what humans are capable of,

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:05.988
by mixing in people who are too different.

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:09.552
JH: Yes, but I can make it
much more palatable

00:06:09.576 --> 00:06:12.374
by saying it's not necessarily about race.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.086
It's about culture.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.283
There's wonderful work by a political
scientist named Karen Stenner,

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:21.534
who shows that when people have a sense

00:06:21.558 --> 00:06:23.793
that we are all united,
we're all the same,

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:27.067
there are many people who have
a predisposition to authoritarianism.

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:29.133
Those people aren't particularly racist

00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:31.324
when they feel as through
there's not a threat

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:33.047
to our social and moral order.

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.104
But if you prime them experimentally

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:38.260
by thinking we're coming apart,
people are getting more different,

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:41.807
then they get more racist, homophobic,
they want to kick out the deviants.

00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:44.738
So it's in part that you get
an authoritarian reaction.

00:06:44.762 --> 00:06:47.099
The left, following through
the Lennonist line --

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:48.409
the John Lennon line --

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:50.842
does things that create
an authoritarian reaction.

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:53.661
We're certainly seeing that
in America with the alt-right.

00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:56.267
We saw it in Britain,
we've seen it all over Europe.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.873
But the more positive part of that

00:06:58.897 --> 00:07:03.194
is that I think the localists,
or the nationalists, are actually right --

00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.005
that, if you emphasize
our cultural similarity,

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.256
then race doesn't actually
matter very much.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.988
So an assimilationist
approach to immigration

00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:13.569
removes a lot of these problems.

00:07:13.593 --> 00:07:15.980
And if you value having
a generous welfare state,

00:07:16.004 --> 00:07:18.477
you've got to emphasize
that we're all the same.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.934
CA: OK, so rising immigration
and fears about that

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.125
are one of the causes
of the current divide.

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:26.862
What are other causes?

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:28.907
JH: The next principle of moral psychology

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.734
is that intuitions come first,
strategic reasoning second.

00:07:32.758 --> 00:07:35.238
You've probably heard
the term "motivated reasoning"

00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:36.869
or "confirmation bias."

00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:38.810
There's some really interesting work

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:41.911
on how our high intelligence
and our verbal abilities

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:45.137
might have evolved
not to help us find out the truth,

00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.133
but to help us manipulate each other,
defend our reputation ...

00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:51.123
We're really, really good
at justifying ourselves.

00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:53.514
And when you bring
group interests into account,

00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:56.275
so it's not just me,
it's my team versus your team,

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:59.212
whereas if you're evaluating evidence
that your side is wrong,

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:00.993
we just can't accept that.

00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:03.734
So this is why you can't win
a political argument.

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:05.251
If you're debating something,

00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:08.322
you can't persuade the person
with reasons and evidence,

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:10.691
because that's not
the way reasoning works.

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:13.830
So now, give us the internet,
give us Google:

00:08:14.522 --> 00:08:17.252
"I heard that Barack Obama
was born in Kenya.

00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:21.224
Let me Google that -- oh my God!
10 million hits! Look, he was!"

00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:24.388
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant
surprise to a lot of people.

00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:27.260
Social media has often been framed
by techno-optimists

00:08:27.284 --> 00:08:32.531
as this great connecting force
that would bring people together.

00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:36.477
And there have been some
unexpected counter-effects to that.

00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:38.073
JH: That's right.

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:40.478
That's why I'm very enamored
of yin-yang views

00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:42.120
of human nature and left-right --

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:44.610
that each side is right
about certain things,

00:08:44.634 --> 00:08:46.755
but then it goes blind to other things.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:49.757
And so the left generally believes
that human nature is good:

00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:52.946
bring people together, knock down
the walls and all will be well.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.528
The right -- social conservatives,
not libertarians --

00:08:55.552 --> 00:08:59.805
social conservatives generally
believe people can be greedy

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:01.211
and sexual and selfish,

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:03.655
and we need regulation,
and we need restrictions.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:06.616
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.869
allow people to communicate
all over the world,

00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:10.951
you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:12.236
CA: So help us understand.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.812
These principles of human nature
have been with us forever.

00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:23.692
What's changed that's deepened
this feeling of division?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.016
JH: You have to see six to ten
different threads all coming together.

00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:31.066
I'll just list a couple of them.

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:35.876
So in America, one of the big --
actually, America and Europe --

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.813
one of the biggest ones is World War II.

00:09:37.837 --> 00:09:40.480
There's interesting research
from Joe Henrich and others

00:09:40.504 --> 00:09:42.907
that says if your country was at war,

00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:44.488
especially when you were young,

00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:47.626
then we test you 30 years later
in a commons dilemma

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.979
or a prisoner's dilemma,

00:09:49.003 --> 00:09:50.294
you're more cooperative.

00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:53.856
Because of our tribal nature, if you're --

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.797
my parents were teenagers
during World War II,

00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:59.382
and they would go out
looking for scraps of aluminum

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:00.595
to help the war effort.

00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:02.797
I mean, everybody pulled together.

00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.350
And so then these people go on,

00:10:04.374 --> 00:10:06.772
they rise up through business
and government,

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:08.427
they take leadership positions.

00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:11.702
They're really good
at compromise and cooperation.

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.661
They all retire by the '90s.

00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:16.986
So we're left with baby boomers
by the end of the '90s.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.977
And their youth was spent fighting
each other within each country,

00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.648
in 1968 and afterwards.

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:26.666
The loss of the World War II generation,
"The Greatest Generation,"

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.974
is huge.

00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:29.742
So that's one.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.563
Another, in America,
is the purification of the two parties.

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:36.996
There used to be liberal Republicans
and conservative Democrats.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.187
So America had a mid-20th century
that was really bipartisan.

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:44.578
But because of a variety of factors
that started things moving,

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:48.000
by the 90's, we had a purified
liberal party and conservative party.

00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:50.669
So now, the people in either party
really are different,

00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:53.176
and we really don't want
our children to marry them,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.268
which, in the '60s,
didn't matter very much.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:57.089
So, the purification of the parties.

00:10:57.113 --> 00:10:59.585
Third is the internet and, as I said,

00:10:59.609 --> 00:11:04.292
it's just the most amazing stimulant
for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.

00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:09.108
CA: The tone of what's happening
on the internet now is quite troubling.

00:11:09.132 --> 00:11:11.979
I just did a quick search
on Twitter about the election

00:11:12.003 --> 00:11:14.923
and saw two tweets next to each other.

00:11:15.335 --> 00:11:19.547
One, against a picture of racist graffiti:

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:21.640
"This is disgusting!

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:24.834
Ugliness in this country,
brought to us by #Trump."

00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:26.806
And then the next one is:

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:30.642
"Crooked Hillary
dedication page. Disgusting!"

00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:35.383
So this idea of "disgust"
is troubling to me.

00:11:35.407 --> 00:11:38.642
Because you can have an argument
or a disagreement about something,

00:11:38.666 --> 00:11:40.227
you can get angry at someone.

00:11:41.094 --> 00:11:44.687
Disgust, I've heard you say,
takes things to a much deeper level.

00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:46.598
JH: That's right. Disgust is different.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.585
Anger -- you know, I have kids.

00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:50.359
They fight 10 times a day,

00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:52.350
and they love each other 30 times a day.

00:11:52.374 --> 00:11:55.284
You just go back and forth:
you get angry, you're not angry;

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:56.831
you're angry, you're not angry.

00:11:56.855 --> 00:11:58.165
But disgust is different.

00:11:58.189 --> 00:12:02.662
Disgust paints the person
as subhuman, monstrous,

00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:04.495
deformed, morally deformed.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.943
Disgust is like indelible ink.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:11.283
There's research from John Gottman
on marital therapy.

00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:16.432
If you look at the faces -- if one
of the couple shows disgust or contempt,

00:12:16.456 --> 00:12:19.552
that's a predictor that they're going
to get divorced soon,

00:12:19.576 --> 00:12:22.475
whereas if they show anger,
that doesn't predict anything,

00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:25.208
because if you deal with anger well,
it actually is good.

00:12:25.232 --> 00:12:26.684
So this election is different.

00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:30.362
Donald Trump personally
uses the word "disgust" a lot.

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:33.243
He's very germ-sensitive,
so disgust does matter a lot --

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:37.177
more for him, that's something
unique to him --

00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:40.104
but as we demonize each other more,

00:12:40.128 --> 00:12:43.537
and again, through
the Manichaean worldview,

00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:46.291
the idea that the world
is a battle between good and evil

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.662
as this has been ramping up,

00:12:47.686 --> 00:12:51.012
we're more likely not just to say
they're wrong or I don't like them,

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.572
but we say they're evil, they're satanic,

00:12:53.596 --> 00:12:55.517
they're disgusting, they're revolting.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.407
And then we want nothing to do with them.

00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:02.293
And that's why I think we're seeing it,
for example, on campus now.

00:13:02.317 --> 00:13:04.957
We're seeing more the urge
to keep people off campus,

00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:06.926
silence them, keep them away.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.545
I'm afraid that this whole
generation of young people,

00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:13.362
if their introduction to politics
involves a lot of disgust,

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:17.091
they're not going to want to be involved
in politics as they get older.

00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:19.346
CA: So how do we deal with that?

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.850
Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?

00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:26.822
JH: You can't do it with reasons.

00:13:27.312 --> 00:13:28.503
I think ...

00:13:30.257 --> 00:13:33.474
I studied disgust for many years,
and I think about emotions a lot.

00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:37.023
And I think that the opposite
of disgust is actually love.

00:13:37.764 --> 00:13:40.855
Love is all about, like ...

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:43.810
Disgust is closing off, borders.

00:13:43.834 --> 00:13:46.379
Love is about dissolving walls.

00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:49.554
So personal relationships, I think,

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:52.337
are probably the most
powerful means we have.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.988
You can be disgusted by a group of people,

00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:57.930
but then you meet a particular person

00:13:57.954 --> 00:14:00.730
and you genuinely discover
that they're lovely.

00:14:00.754 --> 00:14:05.050
And then gradually that chips away
or changes your category as well.

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:11.993
The tragedy is, Americans used to be
much more mixed up in the their towns

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:14.151
by left-right or politics.

00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:16.506
And now that it's become
this great moral divide,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.673
there's a lot of evidence
that we're moving to be near people

00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:21.209
who are like us politically.

00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:23.763
It's harder to find somebody
who's on the other side.

00:14:23.787 --> 00:14:26.077
So they're over there, they're far away.

00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:27.671
It's harder to get to know them.

00:14:27.695 --> 00:14:31.919
CA: What would you say to someone
or say to Americans,

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.101
people generally,

00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:35.734
about what we should understand
about each other

00:14:35.758 --> 00:14:39.233
that might help us rethink for a minute

00:14:39.257 --> 00:14:41.460
this "disgust" instinct?

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:43.238
JH: Yes.

00:14:43.262 --> 00:14:45.415
A really important
thing to keep in mind --

00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:50.155
there's research by political
scientist Alan Abramowitz,

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:54.172
showing that American democracy
is increasingly governed

00:14:54.196 --> 00:14:56.439
by what's called "negative partisanship."

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:59.986
That means you think,
OK there's a candidate,

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.416
you like the candidate,
you vote for the candidate.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.499
But with the rise of negative advertising

00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:06.747
and social media
and all sorts of other trends,

00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.812
increasingly, the way elections are done

00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:12.817
is that each side tries to make
the other side so horrible, so awful,

00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:14.882
that you'll vote for my guy by default.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:18.289
And so as we more and more vote
against the other side

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:19.644
and not for our side,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:25.175
you have to keep in mind
that if people are on the left,

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.109
they think, "Well, I used to think
that Republicans were bad,

00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:29.616
but now Donald Trump proves it.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.491
And now every Republican,
I can paint with all the things

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.897
that I think about Trump."

00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:35.514
And that's not necessarily true.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:38.230
They're generally not very happy
with their candidate.

00:15:38.254 --> 00:15:42.970
This is the most negative partisanship
election in American history.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.223
So you have to first separate
your feelings about the candidate

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:50.184
from your feelings about the people
who are given a choice.

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:52.691
And then you have to realize that,

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:55.666
because we all live
in a separate moral world --

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.141
the metaphor I use in the book
is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,"

00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:02.689
or each moral community is a matrix,
a consensual hallucination.

00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:04.956
And so if you're within the blue matrix,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.174
everything's completely compelling
that the other side --

00:16:08.198 --> 00:16:11.829
they're troglodytes, they're racists,
they're the worst people in the world,

00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:13.957
and you have all the facts
to back that up.

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:16.256
But somebody in the next house from yours

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.313
is living in a different moral matrix.

00:16:18.337 --> 00:16:20.284
They live in a different video game,

00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:22.686
and they see a completely
different set of facts.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.386
And each one sees
different threats to the country.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.500
And what I've found
from being in the middle

00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:30.451
and trying to understand both sides
is: both sides are right.

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:32.595
There are a lot of threats
to this country,

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:36.104
and each side is constitutionally
incapable of seeing them all.

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:43.482
CA: So, are you saying
that we almost need a new type of empathy?

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.676
Empathy is traditionally framed as:

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.391
"Oh, I feel your pain.
I can put myself in your shoes."

00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:51.344
And we apply it to the poor,
the needy, the suffering.

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:55.846
We don't usually apply it
to people who we feel as other,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.335
or we're disgusted by.

00:16:57.359 --> 00:16:58.510
JH: No. That's right.

00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:03.364
CA: What would it look like
to build that type of empathy?

00:17:04.268 --> 00:17:05.506
JH: Actually, I think ...

00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:08.450
Empathy is a very, very
hot topic in psychology,

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:11.132
and it's a very popular word
on the left in particular.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:15.156
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.633
So it's important to empathize

00:17:16.657 --> 00:17:19.481
with the groups that we on the left
think are so important.

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:22.036
That's easy to do,
because you get points for that.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:26.091
But empathy really should get you points
if you do it when it's hard to do.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:28.267
And, I think ...

00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:33.379
You know, we had a long 50-year period
of dealing with our race problems

00:17:33.403 --> 00:17:35.658
and legal discrimination,

00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:37.869
and that was our top priority
for a long time

00:17:37.893 --> 00:17:39.143
and it still is important.

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:40.696
But I think this year,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.124
I'm hoping it will make people see

00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:45.943
that we have an existential
threat on our hands.

00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:48.634
Our left-right divide, I believe,

00:17:48.658 --> 00:17:50.818
is by far the most important
divide we face.

00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:53.873
We still have issues about race
and gender and LGBT,

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:57.268
but this is the urgent need
of the next 50 years,

00:17:57.292 --> 00:18:00.153
and things aren't going
to get better on their own.

00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:03.856
So we're going to need to do
a lot of institutional reforms,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.289
and we could talk about that,

00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:07.643
but that's like a whole long,
wonky conversation.

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:11.513
But I think it starts with people
realizing that this is a turning point.

00:18:11.537 --> 00:18:14.346
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.875
We need to realize:

00:18:15.899 --> 00:18:17.441
this is what our country needs,

00:18:17.465 --> 00:18:19.819
and this is what you need
if you don't want to --

00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:22.538
Raise your hand if you want
to spend the next four years

00:18:22.562 --> 00:18:26.048
as angry and worried as you've been
for the last year -- raise your hand.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:27.777
So if you want to escape from this,

00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:29.952
read Buddha, read Jesus,
read Marcus Aurelius.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:35.038
They have all kinds of great advice
for how to drop the fear,

00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:36.240
reframe things,

00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:38.347
stop seeing other people as your enemy.

00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:41.678
There's a lot of guidance in ancient
wisdom for this kind of empathy.

00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:43.079
CA: Here's my last question:

00:18:43.103 --> 00:18:47.438
Personally, what can
people do to help heal?

00:18:47.462 --> 00:18:51.545
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide
to overcome your deepest prejudices.

00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:53.030
And there's research showing

00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:57.403
that political prejudices are deeper
and stronger than race prejudices

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:58.687
in the country now.

00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:02.827
So I think you have to make an effort --
that's the main thing.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.855
Make an effort to actually meet somebody.

00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:07.089
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,

00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:08.982
somebody who's on the other side.

00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:10.822
So, after this election --

00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:12.603
wait a week or two,

00:19:12.627 --> 00:19:15.463
because it's probably going to feel
awful for one of you --

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:19.639
but wait a couple weeks, and then
reach out and say you want to talk.

00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:21.087
And before you do it,

00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:24.256
read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win
Friends and Influence People" --

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.319
(Laughter)

00:19:25.343 --> 00:19:26.510
I'm totally serious.

00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:29.124
You'll learn techniques
if you start by acknowledging,

00:19:29.148 --> 00:19:30.309
if you start by saying,

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:32.003
"You know, we don't agree on a lot,

00:19:32.027 --> 00:19:34.565
but one thing I really respect
about you, Uncle Bob,"

00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:36.648
or "... about you conservatives, is ... "

00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:38.006
And you can find something.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.793
If you start with some
appreciation, it's like magic.

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:42.931
This is one of the main
things I've learned

00:19:42.955 --> 00:19:44.868
that I take into my human relationships.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.812
I still make lots of stupid mistakes,

00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:48.852
but I'm incredibly good
at apologizing now,

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:51.293
and at acknowledging what
somebody was right about.

00:19:51.317 --> 00:19:52.471
And if you do that,

00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:55.989
then the conversation goes really well,
and it's actually really fun.

00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:59.362
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating
speaking with you.

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:03.144
It really does feel like
the ground that we're on

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:08.035
is a ground populated by deep questions
of morality and human nature.

00:20:08.366 --> 00:20:10.790
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.

00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:13.109
Thank you so much for sharing
this time with us.

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:14.285
JH: Thanks, Chris.

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:15.470
JH: Thanks, everyone.

00:20:15.494 --> 00:20:17.494
(Applause)
