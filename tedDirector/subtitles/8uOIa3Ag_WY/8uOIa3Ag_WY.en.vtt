00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:33.260
(Music)

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
Angella Ahn: Thank you.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Thank you so much.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
sharing our music with you.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
What an exciting and inspiring event.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
We want to play you one more selection.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
And we talk about different ideas --

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
he had this idea

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that he thought music should be from the heart.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
This was in the middle of the 20th century

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
when music from the heart, beautiful music,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
It was more atonal and twelve-tone.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And he insisted on beautiful music.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
Thank you.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:11.260
(Music)

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:18.260
(Applause)
