00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160
I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160
who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
It's something which is suspended

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
between what we believe we can be,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
and a tradition we may have forgotten.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
And yet, when I look at the environment outside,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
you see how resistant architecture is to change.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
We can think them out. We can create incredible things.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
And yet, at the end,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
it's so hard to change a wall.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
We applaud the well-mannered box.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
to create something that has never been,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
And I think that's really what architecture is based on.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
Architecture is not based on concrete

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
and steel and the elements of the soil.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
It's based on wonder.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
the greatest spaces that we have had.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
By the way, it is a story that is told through

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
its hard materials.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
But it is a story of effort and struggle

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
against improbabilities.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
of the pyramids, of pagodas,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
of cities in India and beyond,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
you think of how incredible this is that that was realized

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
not by some abstract idea, but by people.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
So, anything that has been made can be unmade.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
Anything that has been made can be made better.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
There it is: the things that I really believe

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
are of important architecture.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
These are the dimensions that I like to work with.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
It's something very personal.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
or architecture critics or city planners.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
But I think these are the necessary oxygen

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
for us to live in buildings, to live in cities,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
to connect ourselves in a social space.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
And it is that belief that I think drives society.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
And yet it is in times like this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160
They were built in times that were

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
not really the best of times in a certain way.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
And yet that energy and power of architecture

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.160
has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
So again, I am a believer in the expressive.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I have never been a fan of the neutral.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
I don't like neutrality in life, in anything.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
I think expression.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
That's what expression is.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
It's been missing in much of the architecture,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.160
the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
that has no value.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And yet, I believe it is the expression --

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
expression of the city, expression of our own space --

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
that gives meaning to architecture.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Expressive spaces are not spaces

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
that simply confirm what we already know.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Expressive spaces may disturb us.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
And I think that's also part of life.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
but to reach out across the abyss of history,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
to places we have never been,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
So again, radical versus conservative.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
of dead forms.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It is actually a living connection

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
to the cosmic event that we are part of,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
and a story that is certainly ongoing.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
It's actually a story in which our acts themselves

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
are pushing the story in a particular way.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
You know the Soviet architecture of that building

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
is the conservation.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
that have obstructed the mind in moving forward

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
and of course what is radical is to confront them.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
And I think our architecture is a confrontation

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
with our own senses.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Therefore I believe it should not be cool.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
Life without emotion would really not be life.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Even the mind is emotional.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
There is no reason which does not take a position

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
in the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
So I think emotion is a dimension

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
that is important to introduce into city space, into city life.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
is a conversation that I think

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
cities themselves have fostered.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
I think that is the progress of cities.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
It's not only the forms of cities,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
but the fact that they incarnate emotions,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
not just of those who build them,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
but of those who live there as well.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160
But architecture is not the language of words.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.160
It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
tell you a story, but the story is very short,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
which says, "We have no story to tell you."

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160
(Laughter)

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
So the important thing actually,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
which might be totally inexplicable in words,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
because they operate in proportions,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
in materials, in light.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
They connect themselves into various sources,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160
into a kind of complex vector matrix

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
that isn't really frontal

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
but is really embedded in the lives,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and in the history of a city, and of a people.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I think is a false notion,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
which has reduced architecture into banality.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
Hand versus the computer.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Of course, what would we be without computers?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
Our whole practice depends on computing.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.160
the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Because I believe that the hand

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
has a source, though the source is unknown,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
though we don't have to be mystical about it.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
We realize that the hand has been given us

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
And I think when I draw drawings

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160
which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings --

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
drawings that can come from sources

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
that are completely not known, not normal, not seen,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working --

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.160
how can we make the computer respond to our hand

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
rather than the hand responding to the computer.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.160
Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.160
You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
genetics, economics

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.160
are complex complex fields.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.160
There is no reason that architecture should shy away

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.160
and present this illusory world of the simple.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
It is complex. Space is complex.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
And as wondrous as it is,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
that we have often come to be admired.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
And yet, our lives are complex.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Our emotions are complex.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
Our intellectual desires are complex.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
So I do believe that architecture as I see it

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.160
in every intimacy that we possess.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
Of course that means that architecture is political.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
The political is not an enemy of architecture.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
The politeama is the city. It's all of us together.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
And I've always believed that the act of architecture,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
because it will be visible to others.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
So again, the evasion of that sphere,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
has never appealed to me.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
And I do believe that this interaction

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
with the history, with history that is often very difficult,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
to grapple with it, to create

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.160
a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
Because architecture is also the asking of questions.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160
It's not only the giving of answers.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Therefore it is important that it be real.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.160
You know we can simulate almost anything.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
But the one thing that can be ever simulated

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
is the human heart, the human soul.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.160
So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.160
It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
the threshold, the bed --

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
such prosaic objects. And yet,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
which is so enigmatic and so rich,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160
and create something in the real world.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Create a space for an office,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
a space of sustainability

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
that really works between that virtuality

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.160
and yet can be realized as something real.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Unexpected versus habitual.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
It's a self-induced poison.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So the unexpected is always unexpected.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
will always be unexpected.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
the false sort of stability,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
but an architecture that is full of tension,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
an architecture that goes beyond itself

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160
to reach a human soul and a human heart,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160
and that breaks out of the shackles of habits.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
And of course habits are enforced by architecture.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
When we see the same kind of architecture

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160
we become immured in that world of those angles,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
of those lights, of those materials.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
We think the world really looks like our buildings.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
that have been part of them.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
So again, the unexpected which is also the raw.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
And I often think of the raw and the refined.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
What is raw? The raw, I would say

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
is the naked experience, untouched by luxury,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160
untouched by expensive materials,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160
untouched by the kind of refinement

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
that we associate with high culture.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
So the rawness, I think, in space,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
translate into a raw space,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
a space that isn't decorated,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
a space that is not mannered in any source,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.160
but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
might be refractive to our desires.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
A space that doesn't always follow us

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
like a dog that has been trained to follow us,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
other possibilities, other experiences,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.160
that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
something which is focused on reality,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
something that has the power, through its leverage,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
to transform even a very small space.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
So architecture maybe is not so big, like science,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
but through its focal point

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
it can leverage in an Archimedian way

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.160
what we think the world is really about.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
And often it takes just a building

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.160
to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.160
how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
And of course buildings have their shapes.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Those shapes are difficult to change.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
And yet, I do believe that in every social space,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.160
in every public space,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
there is a desire to communicate more

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160
than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
forward, backward, sideways and around.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
So that is indeed what is memory.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.160
So I believe that my main interest is to memory.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
Without memory we would be amnesiacs.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
We would not know which way we were going,

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
and why we are going where we're going.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
rehashing of the same things over and over again,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
which, of course, get accolades of critics.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.160
But I rather play something

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160
completely unheard of,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and even with flaws,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.160
than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
by its meaninglessness.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.160
So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
Without the memory there would be no story to tell.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
There would be nowhere to turn.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.160
The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
And it's not only our memory,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
but those who remember us,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
which means that architecture is not mute.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.160
It's an art of communication.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.160
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160
It can reach into millennia

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160
that have been buried,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160
and return them in a just and unexpected equity.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.160
So again, I think the notion that

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
And that indeed is the architectural mission

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
that I believe is important,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
is to create spaces that are vibrant,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
that are pluralistic,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
that can transform the most prosaic activities,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.160
and raise them to a completely different expectation.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Create a shopping center, a swimming place

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
that is more like a museum than like entertainment.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
And these are our dreams.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
it should not play it safe.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.160
it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
And I think, of course,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
risk is what underlies the world.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
World without risk would not be worth living.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.160
Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
Risks of spaces that have never been

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
so dizzying,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.160
as they should be, for a pioneering city.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.160
Risks that really move architecture

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
even with all its flaws, into a space which is much better

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
that the ever again repeated

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
hollowness of a ready-made thing.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.160
And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
It's about space. It's not about fashion.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
It's not about decoration.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
It's about creating with minimal means

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
something which can not be repeated,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160
cannot be simulated in any other sphere.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.160
And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
is the space we need to dream.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
These are the spaces that are

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
not just luxurious spaces for some of us,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
but are important for everybody in this world.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.160
So again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.160
It's about carving out a space for trees.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.160
It's carving out a space where nature can enter

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160
the domestic world of a city.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
A space where something which has never seen a light of day

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.160
can enter into the inner workings of a density.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
And I think that is really the nature of architecture.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Now I am a believer in democracy.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
I don't like beautiful buildings

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
built for totalitarian regimes.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
And yet when I think of the poverty of society

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
which doesn't give freedom to its people,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
I don't admire those buildings.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
And of course, at Ground Zero what else?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.160
It's such a complex project.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160
It's emotional. There is so many interests.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.160
It's political. There is so many parties to this project.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
There are emotions of the victims.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.160
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
I would not have liked somebody to say,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.160
"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want."

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
I think nothing good will come out of that.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
I think architecture is about consensus.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.160
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Compromise, if it's artistic,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.160
if it is able to cope with its strategies --

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
and there is my first sketch and the last rendering --

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
it's not that far away.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
And yet, compromise, consensus,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.160
that is what I believe in.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.160
And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.160
It's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160
And that is where I end.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
on a ship like millions of others,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
looking at America from that point of view.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160
This is America. This is liberty.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
This is what we dream about. Its individuality,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.160
demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.160
not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160
(Applause)

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
So have you come to peace

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
with the process that happened at Ground Zero

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160
Daniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
of the notion that we are authoritarian,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
that we can determine everything that happens.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.160
We have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.160
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.160
not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.160
everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
will be meaningful, will be inspiring,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
will tell other generations of the sacrifices,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
of the meaning of this event.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
Not just for New York, but for the world.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Daniel Libeskind.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
(Applause)
