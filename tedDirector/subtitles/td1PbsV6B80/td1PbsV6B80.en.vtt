00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I grew up in New York City,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
between Harlem and the Bronx.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Growing up as a boy, we were taught

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
had to be courageous, dominating --

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
no pain, no emotions,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
with the exception of anger --

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and definitely no fear;

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that men are in charge,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
which means women are not;

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
that men lead,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and you should just follow and do what we say;

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that men are superior; women are inferior;

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that men are strong; women are weak;

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that women are of less value,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
property of men,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and objects,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
particularly sexual objects.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
I've later come to know that to be

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
the collective socialization of men,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
better known

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
as the "man box."

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
See this man box has in it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
all the ingredients

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
of how we define what it means to be a man.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
there are some wonderful, wonderful,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
absolutely wonderful things

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
about being a man.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
But at the same time,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
there's some stuff

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that's just straight up twisted,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and we really need to begin

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to challenge, look at it

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and really get in the process

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of deconstructing, redefining,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
what we come to know as manhood.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
They're 11 and 12.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Kendall and Jay.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
(Laughter)

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And when they were about five and six,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
four and five,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Jay could come to me,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
come to me crying.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It didn't matter what she was crying about,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
just cry, cry it out.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Now Kendall on the other hand --

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
he'd come to me crying,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
a clock would go off.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
which means, by the time he got to me,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Hold your head up. Look at me.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Explain to me what's wrong.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
Why are you crying?"

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
And out of my own frustration

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
of my role and responsibility

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
of building him up as a man

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to fit into these guidelines

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and these structures that are defining this man box,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
I would find myself saying things like,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
"Just go in your room.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Just go on, go on in your room.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Sit down,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
get yourself together

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and come back and talk to me

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
when you can talk to me like a --" what?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
(Audience: Man.)

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Like a man.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And he's five years old.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And as I grow in life,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I would say to myself,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
"My God, what's wrong with me?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
And I think back.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
I think back to my father.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
There was a time in my life

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
My brother, Henry, he died tragically

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
when we were teenagers.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
We lived in New York City, as I said.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
We lived in the Bronx at the time,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
it was about two hours outside of the city.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And as we were preparing

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
to come back from the burial,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
the cars stopped at the bathroom

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
to let folks take care of themselves

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
before the long ride back to the city.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And the limousine empties out.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and no sooner than the women got out,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
he burst out crying.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
He didn't want cry in front of me,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and it was better me than to allow himself

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And this is a man

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
who, 10 minutes ago,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
had just put his teenage son

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
in the ground --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
something I just can't even imagine.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
The thing that sticks with me the most

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is that he was apologizing to me

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
for crying in front of me,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
lifting me up,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
for not crying.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
I come to also look at this

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
as this fear that we have as men,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
this fear that just has us paralyzed,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
holding us hostage

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to this man box.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
I can remember speaking

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and I asked him, I said,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
"How would you feel if,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
in front of all the players,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Now I expected him to say something like,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
No, the boy said to me --

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the boy said to me,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
"It would destroy me."

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And I said to myself,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
"God, if it would destroy him

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
to be called a girl,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
what are we then teaching him

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
about girls?"

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.260
(Applause)

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
It took me back to a time

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
when I was about 12 years old.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
At this time we're living in the Bronx,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
He was about 16 years old,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
He was a troubled kid.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
He was being raised by his grandmother.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
His father wasn't on the set.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
His grandmother had two jobs.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
He was home alone a lot.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
we looked up to this dude, man.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
He was cool. He was fine.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
He was having sex.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
We all looked up to him.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Johnny call, you go.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
So I run right upstairs.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Now I immediately knew what he meant.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Because for me growing up at that time,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and our relationship with this man box,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
sex or drugs --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and we weren't doing drugs.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Now my box, my card,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
my man box card,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
was immediately in jeopardy.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Two things: One, I never had sex.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
We don't talk about that as men.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
the first time you had sex.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
There ain't no first time.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
(Laughter)

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Women are objects,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
especially sexual objects.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
He told me to go in his room.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
She's 16 years old.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
She's nude.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
higher-functioning at times than others.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Because, while Sheila never said no,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
she also never said yes.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
So when I go in the room, I close the door.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Folks, I'm petrified.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and see that I'm not doing anything,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So in my 12 years of wisdom,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
I zip my pants down,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I walk out into the room,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and lo and behold to me,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
while I was in the room with Sheila,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So now there's a living room full of guys.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
And they asked me how was it,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and I say to them, "It was good,"

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and I zip my pants up in front of them,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
and I head for the door.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Now I say this all with remorse,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
because I didn't get caught.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
This fear, getting outside the man box,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
totally enveloped me.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
It was way more important to me,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
about me and my man box card

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
than about Sheila

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and what was happening to her.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
See collectively, we as men

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
are taught to have less value in women,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
to view them as property and the objects of men.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
We as men, good men,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
the large majority of men,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
we operate on the foundation

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
of this whole collective socialization.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
You see, we have to come to understand

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and the violence can't happen without it.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
So we're very much a part of the solution

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
as well as the problem.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
The center for disease control says

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
is the number one health concern for women

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
in this country and abroad.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So quickly, I'd like to just say,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
The world I envision for her --

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
I need you on board. I need you with me.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
I need you working with me and me working with you

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
on how we raise our sons

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and teach them to be men --

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
that it's okay to not be dominating,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
that it's okay to promote equality,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
that it's okay to be whole,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
that my liberation as a man

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
I asked a nine-year-old boy,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
"What would life be like for you,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
He said to me, "I would be free."

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
Thank you folks.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:07.260
(Applause)
