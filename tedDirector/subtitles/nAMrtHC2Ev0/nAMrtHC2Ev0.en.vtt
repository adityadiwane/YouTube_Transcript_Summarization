00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
All buildings today have something in common.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
They're made using Victorian technologies.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
This involves blueprints,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
industrial manufacturing

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and construction using teams of workers.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
All of this effort results in an inert object.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.260
from our environment into our homes and cities.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
This is not sustainable.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
is by connecting them to nature,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
not insulating them from it.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Living systems are in constant conversation

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
with the natural world,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And this is the conversion of one group of substances

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
into another, either through

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
the production or the absorption of energy.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And this is the way in which living materials

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
make the most of their local resources

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
in a sustainable way.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So, I'm interested in the use of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.260
metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
at the Bartlett School of Architecture,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and we're collaborating with international scientists

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
in order to generate these new materials

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
from a bottom up approach.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
That means we're generating them from scratch.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.260
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and he's really interested in the transition from

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
inert to living matter.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
when we're thinking about sustainable materials.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Now all this is -- and it's magic --

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And it has no DNA.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
This little bag is able to conduct itself

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
in a way that can only be described as living.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
It is able to move around its environment.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
It can follow chemical gradients.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It can undergo complex reactions,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.260
some of which are happily architectural.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
So here we are. These are protocells,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
patterning their environment.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
We don't know how they do that yet.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
This is a violent process.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
out of the atmosphere

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and turn it into carbonate.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And that's the shell around that globular fat.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
towards creating bottom-up construction approaches

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
for architecture,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
which impose structure upon matter.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
That can't be energetically sensible.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So, bottom-up materials

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
actually exist today.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and have a look at the brickwork,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
And if you look even closer,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Now a block of limestone, in itself,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
isn't particularly that interesting.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
It looks beautiful.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.260
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
if the surfaces were actually

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
in conversation with the atmosphere.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to dramatic changes

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
in the immediate environment.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So, architects are never happy

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
with just one block of an interesting material.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
They think big. Okay?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
we can start thinking about ecological interventions

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
like repair of atolls,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
or reclamation of parts of a city

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that are damaged by water.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So, one of these examples

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
would of course be the historic city of Venice.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and is built upon wooden piles.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
for the protocell technology that we're working with

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
to sustainably reclaim Venice.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And architect Christian Kerrigan

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
has come up with a series of designs that show us

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
underneath the city.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So, here is the technology we have today.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
This is our protocell technology,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and depositing it in a very complex environment,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
against natural materials.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Now, this is the very interesting part.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
What we need it to do is to be

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.260
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
moving away from the light,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
toward the dark foundations.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
We've observed this in the laboratory.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
The protocells can actually move away from the light.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
So that these don't just exist as one entity,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
we kind of chemically engineer them.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
effectively petrifying it.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
in order for us to become ready

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
to test it out in a case-by-case basis

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
Also it will attract the local marine ecology,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.260
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that connects a city to the natural world

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
in a very direct and immediate way.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
which means that this technology is just as appropriate

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
for developing countries as it is

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
for First World countries.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Secondly, these metabolic materials

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
have some of the properties of living systems,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
which means they can perform in similar ways.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
within the practice of architecture.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And finally, an observer in the future

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
may find it almost impossible to tell

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
whether this structure

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
has been created by a natural process

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
or an artificial one.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Thank you.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Applause)
