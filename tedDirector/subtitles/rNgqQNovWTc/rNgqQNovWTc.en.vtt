00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
It's not about technology,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
it's about people and stories.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I could show you

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
what recently was on television

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
as a high quality video:

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And it was the now director of the entire piece

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
of the veteran's administration --

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
in Vietnam --

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that don't work.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
after he pretty much made his position clear on this --

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
he had his hook and he had his --

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
he wore this arm for less than two hours

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
that, quote -- his quote --

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and I'm not going to show you that polished video.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
show you an early, crude video

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
because I think it's

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
a better way to tell a story.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
A few years ago I was visited by

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
the guy that runs DARPA,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
the people that fund all the advanced technologies

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.260
that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.260
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
from the military

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
and the guy that runs DARPA.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
now and made them available

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
in the most remote places that we put soldiers:

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
They were quite proud of the fact that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
you know, before the dust clears,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
if some soldier has been hurt

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
they will be getting world-class triage emergency care

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.260
in a car accident in a major city in the United States.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
That's the good news.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
The bad news is if they've collected this person

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and he or she is missing an arm or leg,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
part of the face, it's probably not coming back.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
he said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.260
we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Now we've got F18s and F22s,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
and if somebody loses an arm,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And they basically said, "This is unacceptable,"

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and then the punchline: "So, Dean,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
we're here because you make medical stuff.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
You're going to give us an arm."

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
paperwork and DODs.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
No, the guy says,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.260
"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and wearing the arm you're going to give us,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
off this table.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
If it's the grape, they won't break it."

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.260
flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Either way they were going to eat it.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
namely 32 inches from the long finger --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and weigh less than nine pounds."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
50th percentile female frame.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power."

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
am a bashful guy.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I told them they're nuts.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
(Laughter)

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
They've been watching too much "Terminator."

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
(Laughter)

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
Then, the surgeon says to me,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
"Dean, you need to know

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
more than two dozen of these kids have come back

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
bilateral."

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Now, I cannot imagine --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I'm sorry, you may have a better

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
imagination than I do --

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
I can't imagine losing my arm,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
and typically at 22 years old.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
But compared to that, losing two?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Seems like that would be an inconvenience.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
I literally could not sleep

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.260
with no shoulders."

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
So, I decided we've got to do this.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Most of my day job keeps me busy

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.260
But I figured I gotta do this.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Did a little investigation,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
went down to Washington, told them

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.260
I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I told them I'd build them an arm.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Look what it takes to make things like iPods.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
"Great," he said, "You got two years."

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.260
(Laughter)

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
that's under nine pounds

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
that has all that capability in one year.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
We sort of agreed to disagree.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
I went back and I started putting a team together,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
At the end of exactly one year

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
all the sensors, all the microprocessors,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
all the stuff inside.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
all this cool stuff.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
I then thought it would be years

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.260
before we'd be able to make it really, really useful.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
It turned out, as I think you could see

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
people with a desire to do something

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
two guys -- one that's bilateral.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and he's high trans-humeral on the other.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And that's Chuck and Randy together,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
after 10 hours -- were playing in our office.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and a couple of seconds long,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
I can't do it.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
He picks up a spoon, picks it up,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.260
scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
holds the spoon level

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.260
(Laughter)

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
I cannot do that.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
(Laughter)

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
His wife was standing behind me.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
She's standing behind me at the time

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and she says, "Dean,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
So, you've got a choice:

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So, can we see that?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
of all the joints.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
is our engineer/surgeon,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.260
which is a convenient guy to have around.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
little puck between them.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And just as in the spirit of FIRST,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
so they decide to share a drink.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
doing either of those.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
at least for my limited physical skill.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
He's going to pick up a grape -- he didn't drop it,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
he didn't break it --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
and he's going to eat it.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So, that's where we were

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
at the end of about 15 months.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:23.260
(Applause)

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
But, as I've learned from Richard,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.260
the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.260
is not the story.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
or frankly, this whole segment

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
of the medical world.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
as we started this.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.260
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
you can always get three out of four of anything you want;

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I put a bunch of guys in my plane

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
It doesn't matter whether the

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Department of Defense likes this arm."

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
There is only one opinion that matters,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.260
the kids that are either going to use it or not."

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and you're going to see people, lots of them,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
missing major body parts.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.260
They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
But we've got to extract from them

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.260
enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.260
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
We did see a bunch of people,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
and parts they had left were burned;

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.260
half a face gone, an ear burned off.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And we started asking them all questions.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
I could give you fine motor control,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
or I could let you curl 40 pounds;

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
I probably can't do both.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
I can give you fast control

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
with low reduction ratios in these gears,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
or I can give you power;

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
I can't give you both.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And we were trying to get them to all help us

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
know what to give them.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
they're there to help us.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
"Well, would it help if I ..."

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
"Guys, and woman,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
you've given enough.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
what you need."

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
who wasn't saying much.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
You could see he was missing an arm.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
He was leaning on his other arm.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
I called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
If we needed this or this, what would you want?"

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
And he said, "You know,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
I'm the lucky guy at this table.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
I lost my right arm,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
but I'm a lefty."

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260
(Laughter)

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So, he wouldn't say much.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.260
He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And he made a few comments.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
he has no legs.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
So, we left.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
And I was thinking,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
"We didn't give them support and encouragement;

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
they gave it to us.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
They're not finished giving yet."

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
It was astounding.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
So, we went back.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
And I started working harder, faster.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260
And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And it was astounding

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.260
how positive they are.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
So, we went back,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and we've been working harder yet.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
We're in clinical trials,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
we've got five of them on people.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
We're screaming along.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And I get a call and we go back

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
to Washington.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
We go back to Walter Reed,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and a kid, literally,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
20 some-odd days before that

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
was blown up.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And they shipped him to Germany

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
to Walter Reed.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
And he was there,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
and they said we needed to come.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
And I went down

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
and they rolled him into a room.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
He's got no legs.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
He's got no arms.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
He's got a small residual limb on one side.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
Half of his face is gone,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
but they said his vision is coming back.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
He had one good eye.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
His name is Brandon Marrocco.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
And he said,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
"I need your arms,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
but I need two of them."

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
"You'll get them."

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
This kid was from Staten Island.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
And he said, "I had a truck,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
before I went over there,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
and it had a stick.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
You think I'll be able to drive it?"

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
"Sure."

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.260
(Laughter)

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
He doesn't really want a lot.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
He wants to help. He told me that

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
he wanted to go back

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
to help his buddies.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
So, I was on my way out here.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.260
I was asked to stop at Texas.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
There were 3,500 people,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
the Veteran's Administration,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
to help the families

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.260
of all the kids --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
some that have died, some that are

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
like Brandon --

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
and they wanted me to speak.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
I said, "What am I going to say?

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
I can give you ... This stuff is

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
still not as good at the original equipment."

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
"You need to come."

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
So, I went.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
And, as I think you get the point,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
there were a lot people there recovering.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Some further along than others.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
But universally, these people that had been through this

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
had astounding attitudes,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and just the fact that people care

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
makes a huge difference to them.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.260
I'll shut up, except one message

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
or concern I have.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.260
I don't think anybody does it intentionally,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
but there were people there literally talking about,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.260
"Well, how much will they get?"

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
You know, this country is involved as we've all heard,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.260
in this great healthcare debate.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
"Who is entitled to what?

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
Who is entitled to how much?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Who is going to pay for it?"

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Those are tough questions.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
It's not possible. It would be nice

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
but let's be realistic.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
I don't know the answers.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
There are other questions that are tough.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
"Should we be there?

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
How do we get out?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
What do we need to do?" There's very polarized

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260
answers to that question too,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.260
and I don't have any answers to that.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
Those are political questions, economic questions,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.260
strategic questions.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.260
I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.260
concern or maybe statement, then.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
It is an easy answer.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
I know what these kids deserve

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.260
on the healthcare side.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
I was talking to one of them,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
and he was really liking this arm --

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
it's way, way, way better than a plastic

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.260
stick with a hook on it --

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.260
than the one you got.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
But I was saying to him, "You know,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
the first airplane

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
went 100 feet in 1903.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
Wilbur and Orville.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.260
But now we got Eagles out there,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.260
F15s, even that Bald Eagle.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.260
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.260
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
And I said to that kid,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.260
"I'll stop when your buddies

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.260
are envious of your Luke arm

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.260
because of what it can do, and how it does it.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.260
And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.260
until we do that."

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.260
And I think this country

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
ought to continue its great debate,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.260
whining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim."

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
who's paying for what and how much we get,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
the people that are out there

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.260
giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.260
I know what they deserve:

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.260
everything humanly possible.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
And we ought to give it to them.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:25.260
(Applause)
