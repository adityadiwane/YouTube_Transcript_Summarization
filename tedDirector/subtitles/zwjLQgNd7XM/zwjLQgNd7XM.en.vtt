00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.426
For as long as I can remember,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.656
I have felt a very deep connection
to animals and to the ocean.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.891
And at this age, my personal idol
was Flipper the dolphin.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:31.369
And when I first learned
about endangered species,

00:00:31.393 --> 00:00:35.083
I was truly distressed to know
that every day,

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:38.631
animals were being wiped
off the face of this Earth forever.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.662
And I wanted to do something to help,
but I always wondered:

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:45.518
What could one person possibly do
to make a difference?

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.553
And it would be 30 years,

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:50.452
but I would eventually get
the answer to that question.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.531
When these heartbreaking
images of oiled birds

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.633
finally began to emerge
from the Gulf of Mexico last year

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.982
during the horrific BP oil spill,

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.090
a German biologist by the name
of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:06.798
"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:08.122
because studies have shown

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:13.118
that fewer than one percent of them
survive after being released."

00:01:13.142 --> 00:01:15.674
And I could not disagree more.

00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:16.985
In addition,

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.960
I believe that every oiled animal
deserves a second chance at life.

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:24.012
And I want to tell you why
I feel so strongly about this.

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.497
On June 23, 2000,

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:30.411
a ship named the Treasure sank
off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:32.823
spilling 1,300 tons of fuel,

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:38.283
which polluted the habitats
of nearly half the entire world population

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:39.884
of African penguins.

00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.453
Now, the ship sank
between Robben Island to the south,

00:01:43.477 --> 00:01:45.827
and Dassen Island to the north --

00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:48.236
two of the penguins' main
breeding islands.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.280
And exactly six years
and three days earlier,

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:55.026
on June 20, 1994,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.946
a ship named the Apollo Sea
sank near Dassen Island,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.847
oiling 10,000 penguins,
half of which died.

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:04.311
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000,

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:07.236
it was the height
of the best breeding season

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.154
scientists had ever recorded
for the African penguin,

00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:14.145
which at the time, was listed
as a threatened species.

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.903
And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.338
were covered with this toxic oil.

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:22.419
The local seabird rescue
center, named SANCCOB,

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:25.495
immediately launched
a massive rescue operation,

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.908
and this soon would become
the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:32.538
At the time, I was working
down the street.

00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:35.364
I was a penguin aquarist
at the New England Aquarium.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:39.448
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday,

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:41.877
the phone rang in the penguin office.

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.845
And with that call,
my life would change forever.

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.469
It was Estelle van Der Merwe
calling from SANCCOB,

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:49.330
saying, "Please come help.

00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:52.060
We have thousands of oiled penguins

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:57.475
and thousands of willing
but completely inexperienced volunteers.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.102
And we need penguin experts
to come train and supervise them."

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.610
So two days later,

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.605
I was on a plane headed for Cape Town

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.653
with a team of penguin specialists.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:12.388
And the scene inside of this building
was devastating and surreal.

00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.809
In fact, many people
compared it to a war zone.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.333
Last week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:

00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:22.770
"What did it feel like
when you first walked into that building

00:03:22.794 --> 00:03:25.631
and saw so many oiled penguins?"

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.352
And this is what happened.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:32.236
I was instantly transported
back to that moment in time.

00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:37.090
Penguins are very vocal birds
and really, really noisy,

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:39.611
so I expected to walk into this building

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:43.236
and be met with this cacophony
of honking and braying and squawking.

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:45.065
But instead,

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.871
when we stepped through
those doors and into the building,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.085
it was eerily silent.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.019
So it was very clear

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:57.163
these were stressed,
sick, traumatized birds.

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.407
The other thing that was so striking

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:03.359
was the sheer number of volunteers.

00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:06.653
Up to 1,000 people a day
came to the rescue center.

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.236
Eventually, over the course
of this rescue,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.689
more than 12-and-a-half
thousand volunteers

00:04:12.713 --> 00:04:15.032
came from all over the world to Cape Town,

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.635
to help save these birds.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.254
And the amazing thing
was that not one of them had to be there.

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:22.429
Yet they were.

00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:25.758
So for the few of us that were there
in a professional capacity,

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:29.236
this extraordinary volunteer response
to this animal crisis

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.758
was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:34.139
So the day after we arrived,

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:37.068
two of us from the aquarium
were put in charge of room two.

00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:41.291
Room two had more
than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:42.466
Now, mind you --

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.783
three days earlier,
we had 60 penguins under our care,

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:48.120
so we were definitely overwhelmed

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:51.068
and just a bit terrified --
at least I was.

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:53.093
Personally, I really didn't know

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:57.494
if I was capable of handling
such a monstrous task.

00:04:57.518 --> 00:04:58.827
And collectively,

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:01.828
we really didn't know
if we could pull this off.

00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:05.134
Because we all knew
that just six years earlier,

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.173
half as many penguins
had been oiled and rescued,

00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:11.125
and only half of them had survived.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:15.365
So would it be humanly possible
to save this many oiled penguins?

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.939
We just did not know.

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.040
But what gave us hope

00:05:19.064 --> 00:05:22.459
were these incredibly dedicated
and brave volunteers,

00:05:22.483 --> 00:05:25.326
three of whom here
are force-feeding penguins.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.874
You may notice they're wearing
very thick gloves.

00:05:27.898 --> 00:05:30.389
And what you should know
about African penguins

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.341
is that they have razor-sharp beaks.

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:34.539
And before long,

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:37.396
our bodies were covered head to toe

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.791
with these nasty wounds
inflicted by the terrified penguins.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.975
Now the day after we arrived,
a new crisis began to unfold.

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.202
The oil slick was now moving
north towards Dassen Island,

00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.495
and the rescuers despaired,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:52.654
because they knew if the oil hit,

00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:55.527
it would not be possible
to rescue any more oiled birds.

00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:57.535
And there really were no good solutions.

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.710
But then finally,

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:01.679
one of the researchers
threw out this crazy idea.

00:06:01.703 --> 00:06:05.329
He said, "OK, why don't we try
and collect the birds

00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:07.328
at the greatest risk of getting oiled" --

00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:09.095
they collected 20,000 --

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:13.726
"and we'll ship them 500 miles
up the coast to Port Elizabeth

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.053
in these open-air trucks,

00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:17.260
and release them
into the clean waters there

00:06:17.284 --> 00:06:18.713
and let them swim back home?"

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.326
(Laughter)

00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:26.723
So three of those penguins --
Peter, Pamela and Percy --

00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:27.898
wore satellite tags,

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:29.901
and the researchers crossed their fingers

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.166
and hoped that by the time
they got back home,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.415
the oil would be cleaned up
from their islands.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.360
And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.

00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:41.303
So it had been a huge gamble,
but it had paid off.

00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:44.237
And so they know now
that they can use this strategy

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:45.745
in future oil spills.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.614
So in wildlife rescue as in life,

00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:51.780
we learn from each previous experience,

00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:56.010
and we learn from both
our successes and our failures.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:07:00.439
And the main thing learned
during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94

00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:04.842
was that most of those penguins
had died due to the unwitting use

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:08.158
of poorly ventilated
transport boxes and trucks,

00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:10.084
because they just had not been prepared

00:07:10.108 --> 00:07:12.425
to deal with so many
oiled penguins at once.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.363
So in these six years
between these two oil spills,

00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:18.720
they've built thousands
of these well-ventilated boxes.

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:21.617
And as a result,
during the Treasure rescue,

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:26.236
just 160 penguins died
during the transport process,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.237
as opposed to 5,000.

00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:30.656
So this alone was a huge victory.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.255
Something else learned
during the Apollo rescue

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.775
was how to train the penguins

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:37.776
to take fish freely from their hands,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.739
using these training boxes.

00:07:39.763 --> 00:07:43.236
And we used this technique again
during the Treasure rescue.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.970
But an interesting thing was noted
during the training process.

00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:51.452
The first penguins to make
that transition to free feeding

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:54.416
were the ones that had
a metal band on their wing

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.869
from the Apollo Sea spill
six years earlier.

00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:01.236
So penguins learn
from previous experience, too.

00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:05.914
So all of those penguins had to have
the oil meticulously cleaned

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:07.096
from their bodies.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.923
It would take two people at least an hour
just to clean one penguin.

00:08:11.947 --> 00:08:13.236
When you clean a penguin,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.466
you first have to spray it
with a degreaser.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.171
And this brings me to my favorite story
from the Treasure rescue.

00:08:19.536 --> 00:08:22.127
About a year prior to this oil spill,

00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:25.596
a 17-year-old student
had invented a degreaser.

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:28.746
And they'd been using it
at SANCCOB with great success,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.419
so they began using it
during the Treasure rescue.

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:34.443
But partway through, they ran out.

00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:37.708
So in a panic, Estelle
from SANCCOB called the student

00:08:37.732 --> 00:08:39.768
and said, "Please, you have to make more!"

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:41.045
So he raced to the lab

00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:44.147
and made enough to clean
the rest of the birds.

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:46.955
So I just think it is the coolest thing

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:50.517
that a teenager invented a product

00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:54.113
that helped save the lives
of thousands of animals.

00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:58.065
So what happened
to those 20,000 oiled penguins?

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.102
And was Silvia Gaus right?

00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:03.522
Should we routinely euthanize
all oiled birds

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:05.778
because most of them
are going to die anyway?

00:09:05.802 --> 00:09:08.236
Well, she could not be more wrong.

00:09:08.913 --> 00:09:13.236
After half a million hours
of grueling volunteer labor,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.643
more than 90 percent
of those oiled penguins

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:18.236
were successfully returned to the wild.

00:09:18.675 --> 00:09:20.865
And we know from follow-up studies

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:24.996
that they have lived just as long
as never-oiled penguins,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.313
and bred nearly as successfully.

00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:28.893
And in addition,

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:32.746
about 3,000 penguin chicks
were rescued and hand raised.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.439
And again, we know
from long-term monitoring

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:41.351
that more of these hand-raised chicks
survive to adulthood and breeding age

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:43.470
than do parent-raised chicks.

00:09:43.494 --> 00:09:46.950
Armed with this knowledge,
SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,

00:09:46.974 --> 00:09:49.950
and every year, they rescue
and raise abandoned chicks,

00:09:49.974 --> 00:09:54.498
and they have a very impressive,
80 percent success rate.

00:09:54.522 --> 00:09:56.382
This is critically important,

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:58.834
because one year ago,

00:09:58.858 --> 00:10:01.771
the African penguin
was declared endangered.

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:06.014
And they could be extinct
in less than 10 years

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.919
if we don't do something
now to protect them.

00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:10.236
So what did I learn

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.440
from this intense
and unforgettable experience?

00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:17.028
Personally, I learned that I am capable
of handling so much more

00:10:17.052 --> 00:10:18.788
than I ever dreamed possible.

00:10:18.812 --> 00:10:22.721
And I learned that one person
can make a huge difference.

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:24.753
Just look at that 17-year-old.

00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:28.404
And when we come together and work as one,

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:31.202
we can achieve extraordinary things.

00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:35.202
And truly, to be a part of something
so much larger than yourself

00:10:35.226 --> 00:10:38.902
is the most rewarding experience
you can possibly have.

00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:42.251
So I'd like to leave you
with one final thought

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:43.848
and a challenge, if you will.

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:48.063
My mission as The Penguin Lady
is to raise awareness and funding

00:10:48.087 --> 00:10:50.015
to protect penguins.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.506
But why should any of you
care about penguins?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.236
Well, you should care
because they're an indicator species.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.141
And simply put: if penguins are dying,
it means our oceans are dying.

00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:03.181
And we ultimately will be affected,

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:05.346
because, as Sylvia Earle says,

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.236
"The oceans are our life-support system."

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.736
And the two main threats to penguins today

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.366
are overfishing and global warming.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.550
And these are two things

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:19.248
that each one of us actually has
the power to do something about.

00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:23.429
So if we each do our part, together,
we can make a difference,

00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:26.467
and we can help keep
penguins from going extinct.

00:11:26.882 --> 00:11:30.308
Humans have always been the greatest
threat to penguins,

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:32.427
but we are now their only hope.

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:33.602
Thank you.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:38.371
