00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
My journey to coming here today

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
started in 1974.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
That's me with the funny gloves.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
with me, were Moonies.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
(Laughter)

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.330
And within a week

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
I had come to believe

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
that the second coming of Christ had occurred,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
that it was Sun Myung Moon,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
to be his disciple.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
Now as cool as that sounds,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
my family was not that thrilled with this.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
(Laughter)

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
There was an underground railroad of sorts

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
They were called deprogrammers.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.330
And after about five long years

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330
my family had me deprogrammed.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
And I then became a deprogrammer.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.330
I started going out on cases.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.330
And after about five years of doing this,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
I was arrested for kidnapping.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
Most of the cases I went out on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
were called involuntary.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
What happened was that the family

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
And so they took them to some safe place.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
And so after this happened,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
And about 20 years went by.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
There was a burning question though that would not leave me.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
Because something did.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
about this decade of my life.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
And toward the end of writing that book

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
there was a documentary that came out.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
It was on Jonestown.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
And it had a chilling effect on me.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
These are the dead in Jonestown.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
About 900 people died that day,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
most of them taking their own lives.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Women gave poison to their babies,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.330
and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
The top picture is a group of Moonies

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
that have been blessed by their messiah.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Their mates were chosen for them.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
The thing I had to admit to myself,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
with great repulsion,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
was that I get it.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
I understand how this could happen.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
I understand how someone's brain,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
how someone's mind can come to the place

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
where it makes sense --

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that --

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.330
not to try to save the world through genocide.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
And so what is this? How does this work?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.330
And how I've come to view what happened to me

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
is a viral, memetic infection.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
a meme has been defined as

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
an idea that replicates in the human brain

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.330
and moves from brain to brain like a virus,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.330
much like a virus. The way a virus works is --

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
it can infect and do the most damage to someone

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
who has a compromised immune system.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.330
In 1974, I was young, I was naive,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
and I was pretty lost in my world.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
I was really idealistic.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.330
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330
when you are emotionally vulnerable.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
What happens is that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
circular logic takes over.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
"Moon is one with God.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
God is going to fix all the problems in the world.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
All I have to do is humbly follow.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
Because God is going to stop war and hunger --

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
all these things I wanted to do --

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
all I have to do is humbly follow.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
It becomes impenetrable.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
And the most dangerous part of this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
is that is creates "us" and "them,"

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
"right" and "wrong,"

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.330
"good" and "evil."

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
And it makes anything possible,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.330
makes anything rationalizable.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And the thing is, though,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
if you looked at my brain

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
during those years in the Moonies --

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
neuroscience is expanding exponentially,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.330
as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
We're beginning to look inside the brain.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330
a viral memetic infection like this,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
and compared it to anyone in this room,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.330
I am convinced it would look very, very different.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
And that, strange as it may sound,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
gives me hope.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.330
And the reason that gives me hope

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
is that the first thing is to admit

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
that we have a problem.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.330
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.330
And so this is something that, through research and education,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
I believe that we can solve.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:11.330
And so the first step is to realize

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
that we can do this together,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
and that there is no "us" and "them."

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
Thank you very much. (Applause)
