00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.876
Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.121
That's a scientist who 
works in the rainforest

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.552
to document how people use local plants.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.608
I've been doing this for a long time,

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.377
and I want to tell you,

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:27.344
these people know these forests
and these medicinal treasures

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.493
better than we do and
better than we ever will.

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:32.801
But also, these cultures,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.345
these indigenous cultures,

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:39.024
are disappearing much faster
than the forests themselves.

00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:41.974
And the greatest and
most endangered species

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.778
in the Amazon Rainforest

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.618
is not the jaguar,

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.343
it's not the harpy eagle,

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:51.164
it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:54.613
Now four years ago, I injured my 
foot in a climbing accident

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:56.147
and I went to the doctor.

00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:57.741
She gave me heat,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.445
she gave me cold, aspirin,

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.675
narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:05.542
cortisone shots.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.559
It didn't work.

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:09.396
Several months later,

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:11.613
I was in the northeast Amazon,

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.606
walked into a village,

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.073
and the shaman said, "You're limping."

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:18.632
And I'll never forget
this as long as I live.

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:20.466
He looked me in the face and he said,

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:24.382
"Take off your shoe and give 
me your machete."

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:26.587
(Laughter)

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.571
He walked over to a palm tree

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:30.117
and carved off a fern,

00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:31.429
threw it in the fire,

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.121
applied it to my foot,

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:34.950
threw it in a pot of water,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.076
and had me drink the tea.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:40.518
The pain disappeared for seven months.

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:42.444
When it came back, I went
to see the shaman again.

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:44.249
He gave me the same treatment,

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.999
and I've been cured for three years now.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.671
Who would you rather be treated by?

00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:53.557
(Applause)

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.785
Now, make no mistake — Western medicine

00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:58.895
is the most successful system
of healing ever devised,

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:01.470
but there's plenty of holes in it.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.508
Where's the cure for breast cancer?

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:05.378
Where's the cure for schizophrenia?

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.772
Where's the cure for acid reflux?

00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:09.969
Where's the cure for insomnia?

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.888
The fact is that these people

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:13.924
can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:15.570
cure things we cannot.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.952
Here you see a medicine man
in the northeast Amazon

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:19.532
treating leishmaniasis,

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:21.863
a really nasty protozoal disease

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:24.824
that afflicts 12 million
people around the world.

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:27.527
Western treatment are
injections of antimony.

00:02:27.527 --> 00:02:30.028
They're painful, they're expensive,

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:32.139
and they're probably
not good for your heart;

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.779
it's a heavy metal.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.397
This man cures it with three plants
from the Amazon Rainforest.

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:39.712
This is the magic frog.

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.448
My colleague, the late
great Loren McIntyre,

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:44.612
discoverer of the source 
lake of the Amazon,

00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:47.056
Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:50.161
was lost on the Peru-Brazil
border about 30 years ago.

00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:54.756
He was rescued by a group of 
isolated Indians called the Matsés.

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:58.535
They beckoned for him to follow
them into the forest, which he did.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.959
There, they took out palm leaf baskets.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.441
There, they took out these
green monkey frogs —

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.439
these are big suckers,
they're like this —

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.962
and they began licking them.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:10.930
It turns out, they're
highly hallucinogenic.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.832
McIntyre wrote about this and it was read 
by the editor of High Times magazine.

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:20.183
You see that ethnobotanists have 
friends in all sorts of strange cultures.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:23.613
This guy decided he would go down
to the Amazon and give it a whirl,

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:27.350
or give it a lick, and 
he did, and he wrote,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.835
"My blood pressure went through the roof,

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.025
I lost full control of
my bodily functions,

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:33.855
I passed out in a heap,

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:36.381
I woke up in a hammock six hours later,

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:38.555
felt like God for two days."

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:39.864
(Laughter)

00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:41.747
An Italian chemist read this and said,

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:45.583
"I'm not really interested in the theological 
aspects of the green monkey frog.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.168
What's this about the
change in blood pressure?"

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:50.572
Now, this is an Italian chemist

00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:53.187
who's working on a new treatment
for high blood pressure

00:03:53.187 --> 00:03:56.037
based on peptides in the skin
of the green monkey frog,

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:58.319
and other scientists are looking

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.160
at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.749
How ironic if these isolated 
Indians and their magic frog

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.858
prove to be one of the cures.

00:04:07.858 --> 00:04:10.047
Here's an ayahuasca shaman

00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:12.960
in the northwest Amazon, in
the middle of a yage ceremony.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.974
I took him to Los Angeles to
meet a foundation officer

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:19.462
looking for support for monies
to protect their culture.

00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:22.060
This fellow looked at the
medicine man, and he said,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.207
"You didn't go to 
medical school, did you?"

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:27.037
The shaman said, "No, I did not."

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:29.668
He said, "Well, then what can
you know about healing?"

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:31.432
The shaman looked at him and he said,

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:35.248
"You know what? If you have 
an infection, go to a doctor.

00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:41.809
But many human afflictions are diseases 
of the heart, the mind and the spirit.

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.361
Western medicine can't 
touch those. I cure them."

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.550
(Applause)

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.058
But all is not rosy in learning from
nature about new medicines.

00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:56.345
This is a viper from Brazil,

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:59.603
the venom of which was studied at
the Universidade de São Paulo here.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:03.054
It was later developed
into ACE inhibitors.

00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:05.450
This is a frontline treatment
for hypertension.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.084
Hypertension causes over 10 percent

00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:10.458
of all deaths on the planet every day.

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:12.542
This is a $4 billion industry

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:14.734
based on venom from a Brazilian snake,

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:18.068
and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:23.056
This is not an acceptable
way of doing business.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:26.670
The rainforest has been called the 
greatest expression of life on Earth.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.336
There's a saying in Suriname
that I dearly love:

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:34.945
"The rainforests hold answers
to questions we have yet to ask."

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.822
But as you all know,
it's rapidly disappearing.

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.938
Here in Brazil, in the Amazon,

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:41.335
around the world.

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:43.505
I took this picture from a small plane

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:46.453
flying over the eastern border
of the Xingu indigenous reserve

00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:49.502
in the state of Mato Grosso
to the northwest of here.

00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:51.155
The top half of the picture,

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:52.857
you see where the Indians live.

00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:54.414
The line through the middle

00:05:54.414 --> 00:05:56.761
is the eastern border of the reserve.

00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:00.239
Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.411
Top half wonder drugs,

00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:05.996
bottom half just a bunch
of skinny-ass cows.

00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:09.469
Top half carbon sequestered
in the forest where it belongs,

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.143
bottom half carbon in the atmosphere

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:14.546
where it's driving climate change.

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:17.034
In fact, the number two cause

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:19.573
of carbon being released
into the atmosphere

00:06:19.573 --> 00:06:22.411
is forest destruction.

00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:24.227
But in talking about destruction,

00:06:24.227 --> 00:06:26.171
it's important to keep in mind

00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:30.174
that the Amazon is the mightiest
landscape of all.

00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:32.626
It's a place of beauty and wonder.

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:35.117
The biggest anteater in the world

00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:37.065
lives in the rain forest,

00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:39.468
tips the scale at 90 pounds.

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:41.519
The goliath bird-eating spider

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.467
is the world's largest spider.

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.768
It's found in the Amazon as well.

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:49.656
The harpy eagle wingspan
is over seven feet.

00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:52.453
And the black cayman —

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:55.509
these monsters can tip the
scale at over half a ton.

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.858
They're known to be man-eaters.

00:06:58.858 --> 00:07:01.648
The anaconda, the largest snake,

00:07:01.648 --> 00:07:04.375
the capybara, the largest rodent.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.037
A specimen from here in Brazil

00:07:06.037 --> 00:07:09.733
tipped the scale at 201 pounds.

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:12.028
Let's visit where these creatures live,

00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:13.864
the northeast Amazon,

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:15.563
home to the Akuriyo tribe.

00:07:15.563 --> 00:07:21.076
Uncontacted peoples hold a 
mystical and iconic role

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:23.211
in our imagination.

00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.548
These are the people who 
know nature best.

00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:27.399
These are the people who truly live

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.457
in total harmony with nature.

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:33.421
By our standards, some would
dismiss these people as primitive.

00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:35.062
"They don't know how to make fire,

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.314
or they didn't when they
were first contacted."

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:40.458
But they know the forest far
better than we do.

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:43.452
The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,

00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:45.502
and other Indians look up to them

00:07:45.502 --> 00:07:49.757
as being the true masters
of the emerald realm.

00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:52.072
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.815
When I was a teenager rocking out

00:07:53.815 --> 00:07:56.259
to the Rolling Stones in my
hometown of New Orleans,

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:58.794
Pohnay was a forest nomad

00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.291
roaming the jungles of
the northeast Amazon

00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.521
in a small band, looking for game,

00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:06.626
looking for medicinal plants,

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:08.023
looking for a wife,

00:08:08.023 --> 00:08:10.301
in other small nomadic bands.

00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:12.779
But it's people like these

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:14.712
that know things that we don't,

00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:18.822
and they have lots of 
lessons to teach us.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:22.230
However, if you go into most of
the forests of the Amazon,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.037
there are no indigenous peoples.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:25.971
This is what you find:

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:29.120
rock carvings which indigenous peoples,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.550
uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen
the edge of the stone axe.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.622
These cultures that once danced,

00:08:35.622 --> 00:08:38.203
made love, sang to the gods,

00:08:38.203 --> 00:08:39.786
worshipped the forest,

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:43.434
all that's left is an imprint in stone,
as you see here.

00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:46.004
Let's move to the western Amazon,

00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:49.091
which is really the epicenter
of isolated peoples.

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.129
Each of these dots represents

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.422
a small, uncontacted tribe,

00:08:53.422 --> 00:08:58.380
and the big reveal today is we believe
there are 14 or 15 isolated groups

00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.762
in the Colombian Amazon alone.

00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:04.004
Why are these people isolated?

00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:06.711
They know we exist, they
know there's an outside world.

00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:08.731
This is a form of resistance.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.866
They have chosen to remain isolated,

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:14.439
and I think it is their
human right to remain so.

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:16.862
Why are these the tribes
that hide from man?

00:09:16.862 --> 00:09:17.967
Here's why.

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:21.225
Obviously, some of this 
was set off in 1492.

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:23.247
But at the turn of the last century

00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.072
was the rubber trade.

00:09:25.072 --> 00:09:26.722
The demand for natural rubber,

00:09:26.722 --> 00:09:28.628
which came from the Amazon,

00:09:28.628 --> 00:09:31.802
set off the botanical
equivalent of a gold rush.

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:33.678
Rubber for bicycle tires,

00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:35.296
rubber for automobile tires,

00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:37.047
rubber for zeppelins.

00:09:37.047 --> 00:09:40.054
It was a mad race to get that rubber,

00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:42.732
and the man on the left, Julio Arana,

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:45.799
is one of the true thugs of the story.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.492
His people, his company,

00:09:47.492 --> 00:09:49.594
and other companies like them

00:09:49.594 --> 00:09:52.749
killed, massacred, tortured,
butchered Indians

00:09:52.749 --> 00:09:57.656
like the Witotos you see on the
right hand side of the slide.

00:09:57.656 --> 00:10:00.081
Even today, when people
come out of the forest,

00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:02.786
the story seldom has a happy ending.

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:05.906
These are Nukaks. They
were contacted in the '80s.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:09.863
Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.

00:10:09.863 --> 00:10:12.095
And remember, these
are preliterate societies.

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:13.875
The elders are the libraries.

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:15.653
Every time a shaman dies,

00:10:15.653 --> 00:10:19.042
it's as if a library has burned down.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:21.538
They have been forced off their lands.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:25.761
The drug traffickers have
taken over the Nukak lands,

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.739
and the Nukaks live as beggars

00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:30.981
in public parks in eastern Colombia.

00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:33.881
From the Nukak lands, I want to 
take you to the southwest,

00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:36.528
to the most spectacular 
landscape in the world:

00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:38.601
Chiribiquete National Park.

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.740
It was surrounded by three isolated tribes

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.771
and thanks to the Colombian government
and Colombian colleagues,

00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.717
it has now expanded.

00:10:45.717 --> 00:10:47.694
It's bigger than the state of Maryland.

00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:51.135
It is a treasure trove
of botanical diversity.

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:54.090
It was first explored botanically in 1943

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.880
by my mentor, Richard Schultes,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.750
seen here atop the Bell Mountain,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.185
the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.

00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:03.476
And let me show you
what it looks like today.

00:11:03.476 --> 00:11:05.405
Flying over Chiribiquete,

00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:07.983
realize that these lost world
mountains are still lost.

00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:09.788
No scientist has been atop them.

00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:11.981
In fact, nobody has been
atop the Bell Mountain

00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:13.940
since Schultes in '43.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.812
And we'll end up here
with the Bell Mountain

00:11:16.812 --> 00:11:19.070
just to the east of the picture.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.760
Let me show you what it looks like today.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.937
Not only is this a treasure
trove of botanical diversity,

00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:27.715
not only is it home to
three isolated tribes,

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:29.503
but it's the greatest treasure trove

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:32.828
of pre-Colombian art in the world:

00:11:32.828 --> 00:11:35.367
over 200,000 paintings.

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:38.011
The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen

00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:43.697
described this as the Sistine Chapel
of the Amazon Rainforest.

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:46.271
But move from Chiribiquete
down to the southeast,

00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:48.082
again in the Colombian Amazon.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.964
Remember, the Colombian Amazon
is bigger than New England.

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:52.581
The Amazon's a big forest,

00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:54.212
and Brazil's got a big part of it,

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:55.698
but not all of it.

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:57.286
Moving down to these two national parks,

00:11:57.286 --> 00:11:59.435
Cahuinari and Puré

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:00.781
in the Colombian Amazon —

00:12:00.781 --> 00:12:03.469
that's the Brazilian
border to the right —

00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:05.843
it's home to several groups

00:12:05.843 --> 00:12:07.587
of isolated and uncontacted peoples.

00:12:07.587 --> 00:12:09.716
To the trained eye, you
can look at the roofs

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:11.807
of these malocas, these longhouses,

00:12:11.807 --> 00:12:13.728
and see that there's cultural diversity.

00:12:13.728 --> 00:12:15.776
These are, in fact, different tribes.

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.340
As isolated as these areas are,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.593
let me show you how the 
outside world is crowding in.

00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.316
Here we see trade and transport
increased in Putumayo.

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:27.756
With the diminishment of
the Civil War in Colombia,

00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:30.368
the outside world is showing up.

00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:33.120
To the north, we have illegal gold mining,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.812
also from the east, from Brazil.

00:12:34.812 --> 00:12:38.452
There's increased hunting and fishing
for commercial purposes.

00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:41.509
We see illegal logging
coming from the south,

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:44.164
and drug runners are trying to
move through the park

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.370
and get into Brazil.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.128
This, in the past, is why you didn't mess

00:12:49.128 --> 00:12:50.749
with isolated Indians.

00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:52.613
And if it looks like this
picture is out of focus

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:55.899
because it was taken
in a hurry, here's why.

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:58.416
(Laughter)

00:12:58.416 --> 00:13:04.303
This looks like — (Applause)

00:13:04.303 --> 00:13:06.823
This looks like a hangar
from the Brazilian Amazon.

00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:09.566
This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.

00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:11.223
A group called Los Carpinteros.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:15.574
This is their perception of why you 
shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.

00:13:15.574 --> 00:13:17.551
But the world is changing.

00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:20.319
These are Mashco-Piros
on the Brazil-Peru border

00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:22.460
who stumbled out of the jungle

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.414
because they were essentially chased out

00:13:24.414 --> 00:13:26.792
by drug runners and timber people.

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:29.425
And in Peru, there's
a very nasty business.

00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:31.245
It's called human safaris.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.277
They will take you in to isolated
groups to take their picture.

00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:37.323
Of course, when you give them 
clothes, when you give them tools,

00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:39.221
you also give them diseases.

00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:42.068
We call these "inhuman safaris."

00:13:42.068 --> 00:13:44.166
These are Indians again 
on the Peru border,

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:47.384
who were overflown by flights
sponsored by missionaries.

00:13:47.384 --> 00:13:50.315
They want to get in there
and turn them into Christians.

00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:52.510
We know how that turns out.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.284
What's to be done?

00:13:54.284 --> 00:13:56.710
Introduce technology
to the contacted tribes,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.612
not the uncontacted tribes,

00:13:58.612 --> 00:14:01.745
in a culturally sensitive way.

00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:05.891
This is the perfect marriage of 
ancient shamanic wisdom

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.717
and 21st century technology.

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:11.728
We've done this now with over 30 tribes,

00:14:11.728 --> 00:14:14.652
mapped, managed and increased protection

00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:18.555
of over 70 million acres
of ancestral rainforest.

00:14:18.555 --> 00:14:23.828
(Applause)

00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:27.050
So this allows the Indians to take control

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.577
of their environmental
and cultural destiny.

00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:32.566
They also then set up guard houses

00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:34.572
to keep outsiders out.

00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:37.211
These are Indians, trained
as indigenous park rangers,

00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:38.867
patrolling the borders

00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:41.948
and keeping the outside world at bay.

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:44.707
This is a picture of actual contact.

00:14:44.707 --> 00:14:46.614
These are Chitonahua Indians

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:48.617
on the Brazil-Peru border.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:50.321
They've come out of the jungle

00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.062
asking for help.

00:14:52.062 --> 00:14:53.468
They were shot at,

00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:56.205
their malocas, their 
longhouses, were burned.

00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:58.708
Some of them were massacred.

00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:04.494
Using automatic weapons to 
slaughter uncontacted peoples

00:15:04.494 --> 00:15:08.726
is the single most despicable and 
disgusting human rights abuse

00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:11.671
on our planet today, and it has to stop.

00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:18.205
(Applause)

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.928
But let me conclude by saying,

00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:23.792
this work can be spiritually rewarding,

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:26.636
but it's difficult and
it can be dangerous.

00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:29.538
Two colleagues of mine
passed away recently

00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:31.903
in the crash of a small plane.

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:33.681
They were serving the forest

00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:36.429
to protect those uncontacted tribes.

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:38.366
So the question is, in conclusion,

00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:40.191
is what the future holds.

00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.288
These are the Uray people in Brazil.

00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:43.969
What does the future hold for them,

00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:46.640
and what does the future hold for us?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.121
Let's think differently.

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.918
Let's make a better world.

00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:52.836
If the climate's going to change,

00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.917
let's have a climate that changes for
the better rather than the worse.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.084
Let's live on a planet

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.904
full of luxuriant vegetation,

00:16:02.904 --> 00:16:05.010
in which isolated peoples

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.869
can remain in isolation,

00:16:06.869 --> 00:16:08.842
can maintain that mystery

00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:10.368
and that knowledge

00:16:10.368 --> 00:16:12.013
if they so choose.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.128
Let's live in a world

00:16:14.128 --> 00:16:16.497
where the shamans live in these forests

00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:19.441
and heal themselves and us

00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:22.178
with their mystical plants

00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:24.235
and their sacred frogs.

00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:26.082
Thanks again.

00:16:26.082 --> 00:16:30.001
(Applause)
