00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
So, here we go: a flyby of play.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.160
It's got to be serious if the New York Times

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.160
puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
At the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Seriously, but dangerously fun.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
You see any adults?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
Well, lets go back to the 15th century.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
This is a courtyard in Europe,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.160
All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
of what it was like in a courtyard then.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
I think we may have lost something in our culture.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
So I'm gonna take you through

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
what I think is a remarkable sequence.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
there's no ice on Hudson Bay.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
he's wild and fairly hungry.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.160
is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
with a predatory gaze.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160
there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
that you know you're in trouble.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
But on the other side of that predatory gaze

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.160
is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And something very unusual happens.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
and ends up with a meal -- changes.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
And this polar bear

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
stands over the husky,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
And they begin an incredible ballet.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
A play ballet.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
They're in a state of play.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
And it's that state

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
that allows these two creatures to explore the possible.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
without the play signals.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
And it is a marvelous example

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
of how a differential in power

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Now how did I get involved in this?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
to the importance of play,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
in that that individual, by deep study,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
was found to have severe play deprivation.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
Charles Whitman was his name.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
did feel at the end of that study

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.160
that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.160
led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And that finding has stood the test of time --

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
And other studies of populations at risk

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
sensitized me to the importance of play,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
but I didn't really understand what it was.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.160
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.160
before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
But there are ways of looking at it

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.160
that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
When that mother and infant lock eyes,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
and the infant's old enough to have a social smile,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.160
If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
the right brain of each of them becomes attuned,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
builds on this base for us humans.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.160
but it's never just singularly one thing.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
We're going to look at body play,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.160
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
This is a mountain goat.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
If you're having a bad day, try this:

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
And you may feel like this character,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
who is also just doing it for its own sake.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
If its purpose is more important

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.160
And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
and he or she's going to roll down a hill.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
The human hand, in manipulation of objects,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
is the hand in search of a brain;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
the brain is in search of a hand;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.160
JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.160
They have located two consultants,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.160
and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160
that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
hadn't worked with their hands.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
They got together -- JPL hired them.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Now JPL, NASA and Boeing,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
before they will hire a research and development problem solver --

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160
even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
So play is practical, and it's very important.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
But it has to be safe exploration.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
If you want to belong, you need social play.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
And social play is part of what we're about here today,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
and is a byproduct of the play scene.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Rough and tumble play.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.160
scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.160
and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
that come as a part of rough and tumble play.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
Spectator play, ritual play -- we're involved in some of that.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.160
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
where the Red Sox won the World Series.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Imaginative play.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.160
her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
A really important part of being a player

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
is imaginative solo play.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.160
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.160
The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160
I'm telling you a story today about play.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.160
but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
So what does play do for the brain?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
Well, a lot.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.160
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:09.160
because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.160
They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.160
for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.160
and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.160
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
and the play wave is cresting,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
because there is some good science.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
Nothing lights up the brain like play.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe --

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.160
the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
and -- and, and, and.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.160
So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.160
to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.160
who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
And this is one of the ways you can study play --

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.160
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
which has limited the actual study of play.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.160
And we've got a mother-infant play scenario

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
The reason I put this here is also to queue up

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160
my thoughts about objectifying what play does.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160
The animal world has objectified it.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
In the animal world, if you take rats,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:50.160
who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.160
and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
they pin each other, that's part of their play.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.160
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
and then you present those rats

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.160
with a cat odor-saturated collar,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.160
they're hardwired to flee and hide.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
So what happens?

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
They both hide out.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
The non-players never come out --

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160
they die.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
The players slowly explore the environment,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160
and begin again to test things out.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
That says to me, at least in rats --

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
and a similar cortical architecture --

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160
that play may be pretty important for our survival.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.160
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160
Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter)

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160
This took a long time --

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160
And we do know that in domestic animals

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
and others, when they're play deprived,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160
they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160
it's depression.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And I think if you think about life without play --

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
no humor, no flirtation, no movies,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
no games, no fantasy and, and, and.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160
Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160
without play.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And the thing that's so unique about our species

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.160
is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
And we all have capacity to play signal.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
What's going to follow from that behavior

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160
is play.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And you can trust it.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160
And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
That's a shame.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
I think we've got a lot of learning to do.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
So part of the signaling system of play

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.160
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160
its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
through their own sharing of play signals.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
You may not know this word,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.160
but it should be your biological first name and last name.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160
And we are, by physical anthropologists,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
by many, many studies, the most neotenous,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160
the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
And therefore, the most playful.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
And this gives us a leg up on adaptability.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Now, there is a way of looking at play

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
that I also want to emphasize here,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
which is the play history.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Your own personal play history is unique,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and often is not something we think about particularly.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
This is a book written by a consummate player

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
by the name of Kevin Carroll.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.160
Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.160
alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.160
black, had to take care of a younger brother.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.160
Found that when he looked at a playground

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.160
out of a window into which he had been confined,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
he felt something different.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
And so he followed up on it.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.160
And his life -- the transformation of his life

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160
from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death --

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.160
he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.160
And he gives play as a transformative force

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.160
over his entire life.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.160
Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Those of you who remember Al Gore,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.160
during the first term and then during his successful

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
but unelected run for the presidency,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.160
may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
at least in public.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.160
And looking at his history, which is common in the press,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.160
it seems to me, at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view --

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160
that a lot of his life was programmed.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.160
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play --

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
because I do know something about that --

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160
by paying attention to what is his own passion

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
and his own inner drive,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.160
which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160
is to explore backwards as far as you can go

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.160
to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
And begin to build to build from the emotion of that

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
into how that connects with your life now.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
And you'll find, you may change jobs --

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
in order to be more empowered through their play.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.160
Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
and paying attention to it.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.160
Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.160
the d.school, the design school at Stanford,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
who have been visionary about its establishment,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
has allowed a group of us to get together

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.160
and create a course called "From Play to Innovation."

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
And you'll see this course is to investigate

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.160
the human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160
and its importance to creative thinking:

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.160
to apply those principles, through design thinking,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
to promote innovation in the corporate world;

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
and the students will work with real-world partners

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
on design projects with widespread application."

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
This is our maiden voyage in this.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.160
We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
There is our star pupil, this labrador,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.160
who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160
and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.160
And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person who

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160
will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson,

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160
in neuroscience.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160
as they put play principles into practice in the classroom.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.160
And one of their projects was to

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.160
see what makes meetings boring,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.160
and to try and do something about it.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.160
So what will follow is a student-made film

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
about just that.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.160
Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.160
in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.160
Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.160
full involvement and success in the process of the activity.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
An important key insight that we learned about meetings

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
is that people pack them in one after another,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
disruptive to the day.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.160
Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.160
that they left at their desk.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.160
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:21:05.160
(Music)

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
Some sage and repeatedly furry monks

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
at this place called the d.school

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.160
designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.160
Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.160
Because when you need it again,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.160
the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.160
The Wearable Meeting.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.160
Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160
to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.160
But when you take it off --

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
that's when the real action happens.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.160
(Music)

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.160
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.160
Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.160
to engage

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.160
not in the work-play differential --

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.160
where you set aside time to play --

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160
but where your life becomes infused

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.160
minute by minute, hour by hour,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
with body,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
object,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.160
social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.160
And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.160
Thank You.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:34.160
(Applause)

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160
John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.160
there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
and go --

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.160
I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160
that somehow,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.160
the way animals and humans deal with play,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.160
is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.160
Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.160
SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.160
and I think probably because animals have taught us that.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.160
If you stop a cat from playing --

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.160
which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.160
they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.160
And if you imagine a kid

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.160
pretending to be King Kong,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.160
or a race car driver, or a fireman,

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.160
they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.160
So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.160
which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.160
and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.160
And this is where my chasing animals for four, five years

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.160
really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.160
which is that play has a biological place,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160
just like sleep and dreams do.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.160
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.160
animals sleep and dream,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.160
and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.160
and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.160
The next step of evolution in mammals and

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.160
creatures with divinely superfluous neurons

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.160
will be to play.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.160
And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:31.160
or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.160
sets play aside as something separate.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.160
And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.160
So it's not just something you do in your spare time.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.160
JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.160
and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.160
how do you prevent --

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.160
and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.160
How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.160
or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.160
kind of like the Mozart metaphor,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.160
where, "Oh, MRIs show

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.160
that play enhances your intelligence.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.160
Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.160
and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.160
How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.160
on the data that you're developing?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.160
SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.160
is to have accumulated the advisers that I have

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160
who go from practitioners --

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.160
who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.160
a state of play.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.160
So people know that it's there.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.160
And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.160
and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.160
And you get them into a group together focused on play,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.160
and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.160
Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160
for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.160
or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:17.160
I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.160
associated with play.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.160
And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.160
as learning some of the basic things about public health.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160
JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160
(Applause)
