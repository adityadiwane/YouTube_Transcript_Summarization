00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It's a great honor to be here.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
It's a great honor to be here talking about cities,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
talking about the future of cities.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
It's great to be here as a mayor.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I really do believe that mayors have the political position

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to really change people's lives.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
That's the place to be.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Rio's a beautiful city,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
a vibrant place, special place.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Actually, you're looking at a guy

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
who has the best job in the world.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And I really wanted to share with you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
a very special moment of my life

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
and the history of the city of Rio.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
the envelope containing the result.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
that the games of the 31st Olympiad

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
(Cheering)

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
but it was not easy to get there.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Actually it was a very hard challenge.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
We had to beat the European monarchy.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
We had to beat the most powerful man in the world

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
defending his own city.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So it was not easy at all.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
that I think fits perfectly to the situation

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
of Rio winning the Olympic bid.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
We really showed that, yes, we can.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
I came here tonight to tell you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that things can be done,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that you don't have always to be rich or powerful

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
to get things on the way,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that cities are a great challenge.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
It's a difficult task to deal with cities.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
But with some original ways

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
of getting things done,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
with some basic commandments,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
you can really get cities

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
to be a great, great place to live.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I want you all to imagine Rio.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
You probably think about a city full of energy,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
a vibrant city full of green.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And nobody showed that better

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
than Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.260
(Music)

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
(Video) Bird: This is incredible.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:47.260
(Music)

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
but it's not like that everywhere.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
We're like every big city in the world.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
We've got lots of people,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
These pictures I'm showing here,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
they are some pictures from Madureira.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And I want to use an example of Rio

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
that we're doing in Madureira, in this region,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to see what we should think as our first commandment.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
So every time you see a concrete jungle like that,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
what you've got to do is find open spaces.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
If you don't have open spaces,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
you've got to go there and open spaces.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So go inside these open spaces

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and make it that people can get inside

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and use those spaces.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
This is going to be the third largest park in Rio

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
by June this year.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
It's going to be a place where people can meet,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
where you can put nature.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
The temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So the first commandment

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I want to leave you tonight

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
is, a city of the future

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
has to be environmentally friendly.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Every time you think of a city,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
you've got to think green.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You've got to think green and green.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Let's think that cities are made of people,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
lots of people together.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
cities are packed with people.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
So how do you move these people around?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
When you have 3.5 billion people living in cities --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
by 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
So every time you think about moving these people around,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
you think about high-capacity transportation.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
But there is a problem.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
High-capacity transportation means

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
spending lots and lots of money.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
So what I'm going to show here

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is something that was already presented in TED

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
by the former mayor of Curitiba

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
who created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
You transform it inside as a train car.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
You use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
The contractors, they don't like that.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
You don't have to dig deep down underground.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
You can build nice stations.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Again, you don't have to dig deep down underground

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
to make a station like that.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
This station has the same comfort, the same features

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
as a subway station.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So spending much less money and doing it much faster,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
you can really change the way people move.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
This is a map of Rio.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
All the lines, the colored lines you see there,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
it's our high-capacity transportation network.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
In this present time today,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
we only carry 18 percent of our population

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
in high-capacity transportation.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
With the BRTs we're doing,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
again, the cheapest and fastest way,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
we're going to move to 63 percent of the population

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
being carried by high-capacity transportation.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
So remember what I said:

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
You don't always have to be rich or powerful

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
to get things done.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
You can find original ways to get things done.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
is, a city of the future

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
has to deal with mobility and integration

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
of its people.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
Moving to the third commandment.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
And this is the most controversial one.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
It has to do with the favelas, the slums --

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
But the point we want to make here tonight

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
is, favelas are not always a problem.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
I mean, favelas can sometimes

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
really be a solution,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
if you deal with them,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
if you put public policy inside the favelas.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Let me just show a map of Rio again.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.260
More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
All these red parts are favelas.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
So you see, they are spread all over the city.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
You see the contrast between the rich and poor.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
The first one is,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
you can change from what I call a [vicious] circle

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
to a virtual circle.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
But what you've got to do to get that

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
is you've got to go inside the favelas,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
bring in the basic services --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
mainly education and health -- with high quality.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I'm going to give a fast example here.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
This was an old building in a favela in Rio --

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
[unclear favela name] --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
that we just transformed into a primary school,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
with high quality.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
This is primary assistance in health

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
that we built inside a favela,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
again, with high quality.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
We call it a family clinic.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
So the first point is bring basic services

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
inside the favelas

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
with high quality.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
The second point I want to make about the favelas

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Bring infrastructure

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
Rio has the aim, by 2020,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to have all its favelas completely urbanized.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
Another example, this was completely packed with houses,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
This is a place with high technology

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
can go inside and have access to all technology.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
We even built a theater there -- 3D movie.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And this is the kind of change you can get for that.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
which is this great laugh

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
from a kid that lives in the favela.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
is, a city of the future

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
has to be socially integrated.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
You cannot deal with a city

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
if it's not socially integrated.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.260
But moving to our fourth commandment,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
I really wouldn't be here tonight.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Between November and May, Rio's completely packed.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
We just had last week Carnivale.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
It was great. It was lots of fun.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
We have New Year's Eve.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
We have problems.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
You can imagine how people get happy with me

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
watching these kinds of scenes.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
We have problems with the tropical rains.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Almost every year

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
we have these landslides, which are terrible.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
But the reason I could come here

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
is because of that.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
This was something we did with IBM

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
that's a little bit more than a year old.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
from here, from Long Beach,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
so I got here last night and I know everything.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
We're going to speak now to the Operations Center.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
This is Osorio,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
he's our secretary of urban affairs.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So Osorio, good to be there with you.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
I've already told the people

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
that we have tropical rain this time of year.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So how's the weather in Rio now?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
Osorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Let me get you our weather satellite radar.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
today and in the next few days.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
EP: Okay, how's the traffic?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
A live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
You see, the streets are clear.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
We had heavy traffic early in the morning

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and in the rush hour in the afternoon,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
but nothing of big concern.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
We are below average

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
in terms of traffic incidents in the city.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
These are the cars.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
This is live transmission.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
We have GPS's in all of our trucks.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
And you can see them working

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
in all parts of the city.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
Waste collection on time.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Public services working well.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
It was great to have you here.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
(Applause)

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.260
Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
no distance, 24/7 working.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
is, a city of the future

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
has to use technology to be present.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
But everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
are means, are ways,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
for us to govern cities --

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
invest in infrastructure, invest in the green,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
open parks, open spaces,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
integrate socially, use technology.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
we talk about a gathering of people.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
And we cannot see that as a problem.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
That is fantastic.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
If there's 3.5 billion now,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
it's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
That is great, that means we're going to have

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
10 billion minds working together,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
10 billion talents together.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So a city of the future,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
I really do believe

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
that it's a city that cares about its citizens,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
integrates socially its citizens.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
of this great party, which are cities.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Thank you very much.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.260
(Applause)
