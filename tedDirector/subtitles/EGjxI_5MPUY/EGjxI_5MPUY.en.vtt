00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
wrote a volume called

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
"People Who Led to My Plays."

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And if I were to write a volume,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
it would be called,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
because my work,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
in understanding art and in understanding culture,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
has come by following artists,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
by looking at what artists mean

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and what they do and who they are.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
J.J. from "Good Times,"

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
(Applause)

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
significant to many people of course

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
because of "Dy-no-mite,"

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
but perhaps more significant

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
as the first, really, black artist

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
on primetime TV.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
Jean-Michel Basquiat,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
important to me because [he was]

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
the first black artist in real time

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
that showed me the possibility of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
who and what I was about to enter into.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
My overall project is about art --

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
specifically, about black artists --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
very generally

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
about the way in which art

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
can change the way we think

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
about culture and ourselves.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
My interest is in artists

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
who understand and rewrite history,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
who think about themselves

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
within the narrative

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of the larger world of art,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
but who have created new places

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
for us to see and understand.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I'm showing two artists here, 
Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
two of many who really form for me

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
the essential questions that I wanted to bring

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
as a curator to the world.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
I was interested in the idea

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
of why and how

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I could create a new story,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
a new narrative in art history

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and a new narrative in the world.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And to do this, I knew

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that I had to see the way in which artists work,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
understand the artist's studio

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
as a laboratory,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
imagine, then,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
reinventing the museum as a think tank

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and looking at the exhibition

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
providing the space

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
to look and to think about answers.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
In 1994,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
I made an exhibition called Black Male.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
It looked at the intersection

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
of race and gender

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
in contemporary American art.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
It sought to express

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
the ways in which art

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
could provide a space for dialogue --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
complicated dialogue,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
dialogue with many, many points of entry --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and how the museum could be the space

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
for this contest of ideas.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
This exhibition included

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
over 20 artists

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
of various ages and races,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
but all looking at black masculinity

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
from a very particular point of view.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
What was significant about this exhibition

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
is the way in which

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
it engaged me in my role

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
as a curator, as a catalyst,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
for this dialogue.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
One of the things that happened

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
very distinctly in the course of this exhibition

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is I was confronted with the idea

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
of how powerful images can be

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
in people's understanding 
of themselves and each other.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
one on the left by Robert Colescott.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And in the course of the exhibition --

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
which was contentious, controversial

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
and ultimately, for me,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
life-changing

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
in my sense of what art could be --

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
a woman came up to me on the gallery floor

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
to express her concern about the nature

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
of how powerful images could be

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
and how we understood each other.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And she pointed to the work on the left

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
to tell me how problematic this image was,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
as it related, for her, to the idea of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
how black people had been represented.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And she pointed to the image on the right

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that needed to be portrayed

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
to work against those images in the media.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
She then assigned these works racial identities,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
basically saying to me that the work on the right,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
clearly, was made by a black artist,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
when, in effect,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that was the opposite case:

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Bob Colescott, African-American artist;

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Leon Golub, a white artist.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
The point of that for me was

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
to say -- in that space, in that moment --

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
that I really, more than anything,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
wanted to understand

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
how images could work, how images did work,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and how artists provided

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
a space bigger than one

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
to work through these images.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
home for many of black America,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
very much the psychic heart

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
of the black experience,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Harlem now, sort of explaining

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and thinking of itself in this part of the century,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
looking both backwards and forwards ...

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I always say Harlem is an interesting community

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
because, unlike many other places,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
it thinks of itself in the past, present

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
and the future simultaneously;

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
no one speaks of it just in the now.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It's always what it was and what it can be.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And, in thinking about that,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
then my second project, the second question I ask is:

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Can a museum

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
be a catalyst in a community?

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Can a museum house artists

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and allow them to be change agents

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
as communities rethink themselves?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
thinking about exhibitions there,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
thinking about what it means to

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
discover art's possibility.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Now, what does this mean to some of you?

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
In some cases, I know that many of you

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
are involved in cross-cultural dialogues,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Think about the place that artists can play in that --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that is the kind of incubation and advocacy

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
Think about artists, not as content providers,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
though they can be brilliant at that,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
but, again, as real catalysts.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
And I bring this up because it's important to locate

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
this practice in history.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
To look at 1968,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
in the incredible historic moment that it is,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
and think of the arc that has happened since then,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
to think of the possibilities that we are all

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
privileged to stand in today

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
and imagine that this museum

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
that came out of a moment of great protest

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and one that was so much about

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
examining the history and the legacy

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
of important African-American artists

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to the history of art in this country

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Romare Bearden.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And then, of course,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
to bring us to today.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
In 1975, Muhammad Ali

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
gave a lecture at Harvard University.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
"Give us a poem."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
A profound statement about the individual and the community.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
The space in which now,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
of trying to define

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
what might be

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
black art cultural movement of the 21st century.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
What that might mean

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
for cultural movements all over this moment,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
the "me, we" seems

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
incredibly prescient

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
totally important.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
To this end,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
the specific project that has made this possible for me

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
is a series of exhibitions,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
all titled with an F --

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
which have set out to discover

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
and define

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
the young, black artists working in this moment

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
who I feel strongly

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
will continue to work over the next many years.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
This series of exhibitions

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
was made specifically

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to try and question

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
the idea of what it would mean

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
now, at this point in history,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to see art as a catalyst;

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
what it means now, at this point in history,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
as we define and redefine culture,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
black culture specifically in my case,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
but culture generally.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I named this group of artists

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
around an idea, which I put out there

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
called post-black,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
really meant to define them

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
as artists who came and start their work now,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
It is really in this sense of discovery

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
This new set of questions is:

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
What does it mean, right now,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
to be African-American in America?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
What can artwork say about this?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
Where can a museum exist

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
as the place for us all

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
to have this conversation?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Really, most exciting about this

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
is thinking about the energy and the excitement

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
that young artists can bring.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Their works for me are about,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
not always just simply

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
about the aesthetic innovation

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
that their minds imagine, that their visions create

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
and put out there in the world,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
but more, perhaps, importantly,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
through the excitement of the community

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
that they create as important voices

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
that would allow us right now to understand our situation,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
as well as in the future.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
I am continually amazed

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
by the way in which

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
the subject of race

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
can take itself in many places

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
that we don't imagine it should be.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
I am always amazed

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
by the way in which artists are willing

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
to do that in their work.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
It is why I look to art.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
It's why I ask questions of art.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
It is why I make exhibitions.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
Now, this exhibition, as I said,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
40 young artists done over the course of eight years,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
and for me it's about considering the implications.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
It's considering the implications of

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
what this generation has to say to the rest of us.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
It's considering what it means for these artists

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
to be both out in the world as their work travels,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
but in their communities

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
as people who are seeing and thinking

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
about the issues that face us.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
It's also about thinking about

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
the creative spirit and nurturing it,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
and imagining, particularly in urban America,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
about the nurturing of the spirit.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
For me, it is about re-imagining

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
this cultural discourse in an international context.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
So the last iteration of this project

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
has been called Flow,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
with the idea now of creating

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
a real network

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
of artists around the world;

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
really looking, not so much

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
from Harlem and out, but looking across,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
And as many of us think about that continent

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and think about what if means

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
to us all in the 21st century,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
I have begun that looking

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
through artists, through artworks,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
and imagining what they can tell us about the future,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
what they tell us about our future,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
and what they create in their sense of

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
offering us this great possibility of watching

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that continent emerge as part

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
of our bigger dialogue.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
So, what do I discover

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
when I look at artworks?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
What do I think about

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
when I think about art?

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
is not just the discovery of new works,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
the discovery of exciting works.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
But, really, it has been

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
what I've discovered about myself

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
and what I can offer

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
in the space of an exhibition,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
to talk about beauty, to talk about power,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
to talk about ourselves,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and to talk and speak to each other.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
That's what makes me get up every day

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and want to think about

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
this generation of black artists and artists around the world.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
Thank you. (Applause)
