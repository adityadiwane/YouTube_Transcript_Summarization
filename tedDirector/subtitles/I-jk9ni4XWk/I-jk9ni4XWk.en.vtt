00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Something called the Danish Twin Study

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
established that only about 10 percent

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of how long the average person lives,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.260
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
optimal lifestyle of longevity

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
we can come up with a de facto formula

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
for longevity.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
You have the USDA food pyramid.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
There is what Oprah tells us.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
around what really helps us live longer better.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Should you eat organic meats

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
or should you be eating tofu?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
How about these hormones or resveratrol?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And does purpose play into it?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Well, our approach to finding longevity

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
was to team up with National Geographic,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and the National Institute on Aging,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to find the four demographically confirmed areas

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that are geographically defined.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And then bring a team of experts in there

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
when it comes to longevity.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And the first myth is if you try really hard

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
you can live to be 100.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
False.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
in America live to be 100.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Your chances are very low.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
it's hard to reach 100.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
The problem is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that we're not programmed for longevity.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
We are programmed for something called

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
procreative success.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
I love that word.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
It reminds me of my college days.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
Biologists term procreative success to mean

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the age where you have children

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
After that the effect of evolution

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
completely dissipates.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
the genetic lottery.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
The second myth is,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
there are treatments that can help slow,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
reverse, or even stop aging.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
False.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
those brain cells die, they never come back.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
the cartilage never comes back.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and we can get Alzheimer's.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
There is just too many things to go wrong.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.260
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.260
(Laughter)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
And every time they turn themselves over

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
And it builds up exponentially.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It's a little bit like the days when we all had

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Beatles albums or Eagles albums

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and pretty soon, with successive generations

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
that tape sounds like garbage.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Well, the same things happen to our cells.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
That's why a 65-year-old person

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
is aging at a rate of about

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
125 times faster

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
than a 12-year-old person.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So, if there is nothing you can do

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to slow your aging or stop your aging,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
what am I doing here?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Well, the fact of the matter is

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
my body, your body,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
is about 90 years,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
a little bit more for women.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
But life expectancy in this country

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is only 78.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So somewhere along the line,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.260
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
These are years that we could get.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
We think the best way to get these missing years

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
is to look at the cultures around the world

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that are actually experiencing them,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
areas where people are living to age 100

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
areas where the life expectancy

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
is an extra dozen years,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
of what it is in this country.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And here we have this area where men live the longest,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
they do so with extraordinary vigor.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.260
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
(Laughter)

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Because the land is so infertile,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
they largely are shepherds,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Their diet is mostly plant-based,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.260
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and a type of wine that has three times the level

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
It's called Cannonau.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But the real secret I think lies more

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
in the way that they organize their society.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.260
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
is how they treat older people.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
You ever notice here in America, social equity

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
seems to peak at about age 24?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
Just look at the advertisements.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Here in Sardinia, the older you get

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
the more equity you have,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
You go into the bars in Sardinia,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.260
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to keep them close to the family --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
That's called the grandmother effect.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
We found our second Blue Zone

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
on the other side of the planet,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
on the archipelago of Okinawa.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.260
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And in the northern part of the main island,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
this is ground zero for world longevity.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.260
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
life expectancy in the world.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
They have what we want.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
very quickly,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
and often, I can tell you, after sex.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
big killers here in America.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
What do they do?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Once again, a plant-based diet,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And they eat about eight times as much tofu

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
as Americans do.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
They have all kinds of little strategies

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
to keep from overeating,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
A few of the strategies we observed:

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.260
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
Instead of serving family style,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
they serve at the counter, put the food away,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and then bring it to the table.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
It was invented by Confucius.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.260
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
to travel from your belly to your brain.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that we can associate with longevity.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
We know that isolation kills.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
We're down to one and half right now.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
you were born into a system where you

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
automatically have a half a dozen friends

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
with whom you travel through life.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.260
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and if things go bad,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
child gets sick, parent dies,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
you always have somebody who has your back.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
This particular Moai, these five ladies

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
have been together for 97 years.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Their average age is 102.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Typically in America

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
There is our work life,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
where we're productive.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And then one day, boom, we retire.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And typically that has meant

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
retiring to the easy chair,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
or going down to Arizona to play golf.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
In the Okinawan language there is not even

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
a word for retirement.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Instead there is one word

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that imbues your entire life,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and that word is "ikigai."

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And, roughly translated, it means

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
For this 102-year-old karate master,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.260
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
For this hundred-year-old fisherman

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.260
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
the people who put the questionnaire.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.260
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:20.260
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And I asked her what it felt like

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And she put her head back and she said,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
"It feels like leaping into heaven."

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I thought that was a wonderful thought.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
My editor at Geographic

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
But that's because all the young people left.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
(Laughter)

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
So, we turned to the data again.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
And we found America's longest-lived population

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
among the Seventh-Day Adventists

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.260
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
Adventists are conservative Methodists.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
They celebrate their Sabbath

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.260
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And they follow five little habits

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
comparatively speaking.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
In America here, life expectancy

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
for the average woman is 80.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
But for an Adventist woman,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
their life expectancy is 89.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
who are expected to live about 11 years

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
longer than their American counterparts.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
Now, this is a study that followed

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
about 70,000 people for 30 years.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
the premise of this Blue Zone project.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
This is a heterogeneous community.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
The only thing that they have in common are a set of

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
very small lifestyle habits

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
that they follow ritualistically

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
for most of their lives.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
They take their diet directly from the Bible.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
where God talks about legumes and seeds,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
and on one more stanza about green plants,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
ostensibly missing is meat.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
For 24 hours every week,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
where the kids need to be driven,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
they stop everything and they focus on their God,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
are nature walks.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.260
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
So, if you go to an Adventist's party

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.260
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.260
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
He's a multimillionaire,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.260
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to build a privacy fence,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and hauling poles around.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
he ended up in the operating room.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
But not as the guy on the table;

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.260
the guy doing open-heart surgery.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:45.260
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
throw up rooster tails.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
And then Marge Deton.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
Marge is 104.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
She starts her day with lifting weights.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
She rides her bicycle.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
And then she gets in her root-beer colored

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
1994 Cadillac Seville,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.260
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
who rode his bicycle across

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.260
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.260
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
So, what are the common denominators

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
in these three cultures?

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
What are the things that they all do?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.260
And we managed to boil it down to nine.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and these common denominators hold true.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
And the first one,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
none of them exercise,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
at least the way we think of exercise.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Instead, they set up their lives

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
These 100-year-old Okinawan women

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
30 or 40 times a day.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
Every trip to the store, or to church

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
They don't have any conveniences.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
That's physical activity.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
When they do do intentional physical activity,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
and they all tend to have a garden.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
They know how to set up their life in the right way

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
so they have the right outlook.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.260
disease to cardiovascular disease.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
you turn that inflammatory state

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
into a more anti-inflammatory state.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
ikigai, like the Okinawans.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
You know the two most dangerous years in your life

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.260
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
and the year you retire.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
These people know their sense of purpose,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
of extra life expectancy.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
There's no longevity diet.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
not a hard sell to the American population.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.260
(Laughter)

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.260
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.260
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
They put their families first,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
take care of their children and their aging parents.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.260
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
which is worth between four and 14

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
extra years of life expectancy

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.260
if you do it four times a month.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.260
And the biggest thing here

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.260
is they also belong to the right tribe.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
They were either born into

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.260
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
We know from the Framingham studies,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
that if your three best friends are obese

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.260
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.260
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.260
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
biking or gardening,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.260
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.260
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.260
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
Exercise programs usually start in January;

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
they're usually done by October.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
When it comes to longevity

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
there is no short term fix

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
in a pill or anything else.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
But when you think about it,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
your friends are long-term adventures,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.260
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
to add more years to your life,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.260
and life to your years. Thank you very much.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.260
