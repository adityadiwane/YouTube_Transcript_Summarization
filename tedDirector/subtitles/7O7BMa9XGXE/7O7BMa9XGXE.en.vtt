00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:15.404
I want to talk to you about my kids.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:20.391
Now, I know everyone thinks
that their kid is the most fantastic,

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.490
the most beautiful kid that ever lived.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:24.601
But mine really are.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.932
(Laughter)

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:28.330
I have 696 kids,

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:32.806
and they are the most intelligent,
inventive, innovative,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.676
brilliant and powerful kids
that you'll ever meet.

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:42.086
Any student I've had the honor of teaching
in my classroom is my kid.

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:46.521
However, because their "real"
parents aren't rich

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.421
and, I argue, because they
are mostly of color,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.951
they will seldom get to see in themselves

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.391
the awesomeness that I see in them.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.353
Because what I see in them is myself --

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:00.336
or what would have been myself.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:04.038
I am the daughter of two hardworking,

00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:06.680
college-educated, African-American parents

00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:09.418
who chose careers as public servants:

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:13.054
my father, a minister;
my mother, an educator.

00:01:13.078 --> 00:01:16.614
Wealth was never the primary
ambition in our house.

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:18.737
Because of this lack of wealth,

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.971
we lived in a neighborhood
that lacked wealth,

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.838
and henceforth a school system
that lacked wealth.

00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:28.147
Luckily, however, we struck
the educational jackpot

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.542
in a voluntary desegregation program

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.934
that buses inner-city kids --
black and brown --

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.612
out to suburban schools -- rich and white.

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:41.049
At five years old, I had to take
an hour-long bus ride

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:43.134
to a faraway place

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.955
to get a better education.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:50.136
At five years old, I thought
everyone had a life just like mine.

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:52.651
I thought everyone went to school

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.034
and were the only ones
using the brown crayons

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:56.726
to color in their family portraits,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.831
while everyone else was using
the peach-colored ones.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.174
At five years old, I thought
everyone was just like me.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:08.111
But as I got older, I started
noticing things, like:

00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:11.510
How come my neighborhood friend
don't have to wake up

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.072
at five o'clock in the morning,

00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:15.607
and go to a school that's an hour away?

00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:18.528
How come I'm learning to play the violin

00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:22.260
while my neighborhood friends
don't even have a music class?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.584
Why were my neighborhood friends
learning and reading material

00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:29.036
that I had done two to three years prior?

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.980
See, as I got older,

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:36.691
I started to have
this unlawful feeling in my belly,

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:40.623
like I was doing something
that I wasn't supposed to be doing;

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.358
taking something that wasn't mine;

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.109
receiving a gift,

00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:47.571
but with someone else's name on it.

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.433
All these amazing things
that I was being exposed to

00:02:51.457 --> 00:02:53.155
and experiencing,

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.454
I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.216
I wasn't supposed to have a library,
fully equipped athletic facilities,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.712
or safe fields to play in.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.455
I wasn't supposed to have
theatre departments

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.844
with seasonal plays and concerts --

00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:11.105
digital, visual, performing arts.

00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:16.259
I wasn't supposed to have
fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:19.085
school buses that brought me door-to-door,

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.537
freshly prepared school lunches

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:23.305
or even air conditioning.

00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:26.057
These are things my kids don't get.

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:28.198
You see, as I got older,

00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:31.239
while I was grateful
for this amazing opportunity

00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:32.909
that I was being given,

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.661
there was this ever-present pang of:

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.629
But what about everyone else?

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:42.507
There are thousands
of other kids just like me,

00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:44.267
who deserve this, too.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.429
Why doesn't everyone get this?

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:50.793
Why is a high-quality education
only exclusive to the rich?

00:03:51.634 --> 00:03:55.198
It was like I had some sort
of survivor's remorse.

00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:57.954
All of my neighborhood friends
were experiencing

00:03:57.978 --> 00:03:59.803
an educational train wreck

00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:03.516
that I was saved from through a bus ride.

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:06.561
I was like an educational Moses screaming,

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.194
"Let my people go ...

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:10.055
to high-quality schools!"

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.496
(Laughter)

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080
I'd seen firsthand how the other half
was being treated and educated.

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:19.043
I'd seen the educational promised land,

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:23.306
and I could not for the life of me
justify the disparity.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.292
I now teach in the very same school system
from which I sought refuge.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.407
I know firsthand the tools
that were given to me as a student,

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:39.354
and now as a teacher, I don't have
access to those same tools

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:40.942
to give my students.

00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:46.026
There have been countless nights
when I've cried in frustration,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.326
anger

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.741
and sorrow,

00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:52.056
because I can't teach my kids
the way that I was taught,

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:56.772
because I don't have access
to the same resources or tools

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.686
that were used to teach me.

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:01.564
My kids deserve so much better.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.133
We sit and we keep banging
our heads against this term:

00:05:05.157 --> 00:05:07.722
"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"

00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:11.394
Is it really that hard to understand

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:14.643
why these kids perform well
and these kids don't?

00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.092
I mean, really.

00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:18.931
I think we've got it all wrong.

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:20.116
I think we,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.222
as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:26.988
should flip our paradigm and our language
and call it what it really is.

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:29.135
It's not an achievement gap;

00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:31.806
it's an education debt,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:37.695
for all of the foregone schooling
resources that were never invested

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.564
in the education of the black
and brown child over time.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.846
A little-known secret in American history

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.923
is that the only American institution
created specifically for people of color

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:53.280
is the American slave trade --

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.815
and some would argue the prison system,

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.065
but that's another topic
for another TED Talk.

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.239
(Laughter)

00:05:59.654 --> 00:06:03.947
The public school system of this country
was built, bought and paid for

00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:08.258
using commerce generated
from the slave trade and slave labor.

00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:12.614
While African-Americans were enslaved
and prohibited from schooling,

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:15.797
their labor established
the very institution

00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.509
from which they were excluded.

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:23.121
Ever since then, every court case,
educational policy, reform,

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:26.399
has been an attempt
to retrofit the design,

00:06:26.423 --> 00:06:29.083
rather than just stopping
and acknowledging:

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:31.715
we've had it all wrong from the beginning.

00:06:33.243 --> 00:06:37.286
An oversimplification
of American educational history.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.822
All right, just bear with me.

00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:42.758
Blacks were kept out -- you know,
the whole slavery thing.

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:45.333
With the help
of philanthropic white people,

00:06:45.357 --> 00:06:46.911
they built their own schools.

00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:49.269
Separate but equal was OK.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.459
But while we all know
things were indeed separate,

00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:54.139
they were in no ways equal.

00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:59.736
Enter Brown v. the Board of Education
of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.991
legal separation of the races
is now illegal.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.129
But very few people pay attention
to all of the court cases since then,

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:15.426
that have undone the educational
promised land for every child

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.414
that Brown v. Board intended.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.156
Some argue that today our schools
are now more segregated

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.916
than they ever were before we tried
to desegregate them in the first place.

00:07:27.963 --> 00:07:31.556
Teaching my kids about desegregation,
the Little Rock Nine,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.883
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:07:32.907 --> 00:07:36.237
is a real awkward moment in my classroom,

00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.962
when I have to hear
the voice of a child ask,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.243
"If schools were desegregated in 1954,

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:45.564
how come there are no white kids here?"

00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:47.048
(Laughter)

00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:48.428
These kids aren't dumb.

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.016
They know exactly what's happening,

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:52.889
and what's not.

00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:55.760
They know that when it comes to schooling,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.260
black lives don't matter

00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:00.493
and they never have.

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:08.831
For years, I tried desperately
to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.

00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:12.280
I'd amassed a modest classroom library

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:15.601
of books I'd accumulated
from secondhand shops,

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.088
thrift stores, attics -- you know.

00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:20.572
But whenever I said those dreadful words,

00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:22.792
"Take out a book and read,"

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:25.249
you'd think I'd just declared war.

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:26.966
It was torture.

00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:28.857
One day,

00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:32.314
after I'd heard about this website
called DonorsChoose,

00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:34.654
where classroom teachers create wish lists

00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:36.782
of items they need for their classroom

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:39.333
and anonymous donors fulfill them,

00:08:39.357 --> 00:08:43.358
I figured I'd go out on a limb
and just make a wish list

00:08:43.382 --> 00:08:46.595
of the teenager's dream library.

00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:51.890
Over 200 brand-new books
were sent to my room piece by piece.

00:08:52.672 --> 00:08:57.245
Every day there were new deliveries
and my kids would exclaim with glee,

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:59.226
"This feels like Christmas!"

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.330
(Laughter)

00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:01.519
Then they'd say,

00:09:01.543 --> 00:09:04.415
"Ms. Sumner, where did
these books come from?"

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:05.655
And then I'd reply,

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:09.655
"Strangers from all over the country
wanted you to have these."

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:12.951
And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:16.201
"But they're brand-new."

00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:17.227
(Laughter)

00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:18.830
To which I'd reply,

00:09:18.854 --> 00:09:20.634
"You deserve brand-new books."

00:09:22.137 --> 00:09:25.560
The whole experience hit home
for me when one of my girls,

00:09:25.584 --> 00:09:28.654
as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,

00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:33.960
"Ms. Sumner -- you know,
I figured you bought these books,

00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:36.722
'cause you teachers
are always buying us stuff.

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:41.187
But to know that a stranger,
someone I don't even know,

00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:42.910
cares this much about me

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.935
is pretty cool."

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.495
Knowing that strangers
will take care of you

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.545
is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.784
Ever since the donation,

00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:57.666
there has been a steady stream of kids
signing out books to take home,

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.350
and then returning them
with the exclamation,

00:10:00.374 --> 00:10:01.962
"This one was good!"

00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:03.034
(Laughter)

00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:05.360
Now when I say,
"Take out a book and read,"

00:10:05.384 --> 00:10:07.603
kids rush to my library.

00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:10.896
It wasn't that they didn't want to read,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.470
but instead, they'd gladly read
if the resources were there.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:19.231
Institutionally speaking,

00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:23.607
our public school system has never
done right by the black and brown child.

00:10:24.068 --> 00:10:26.616
We keep focusing on the end results

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.005
or test results,

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:29.875
and getting frustrated.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:32.036
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.897
"How did it get so bad?
How did we get here?"

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.045
Really?

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:39.514
If you neglect a child long enough,

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:42.628
you no longer have
the right to be surprised

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:44.483
when things don't turn out well.

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:47.053
Stop being perplexed

00:10:47.077 --> 00:10:48.703
or confused

00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:50.203
or befuddled

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.606
by the achievement gap,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.853
the income gap,

00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:55.496
the incarceration rates,

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.567
or whatever socioeconomic disparity
is the new "it" term for the moment.

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:03.690
The problems we have as a country

00:11:03.714 --> 00:11:05.797
are the problems we created as a country.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.278
The quality of your education
is directly proportionate

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.160
to your access to college,

00:11:12.184 --> 00:11:13.912
your access to jobs,

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:15.644
your access to the future.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:22.864
Until we live in a world where every kid
can get a high-quality education

00:11:22.888 --> 00:11:24.424
no matter where they live,

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:26.328
or the color of their skin,

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:30.412
there are things we can do
on a macro level.

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:34.953
School funding should not
be decided by property taxes

00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:37.208
or some funky economic equation

00:11:37.232 --> 00:11:40.268
where rich kids continue
to benefit from state aid,

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:44.377
while poor kids are continuously
having food and resources

00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:45.994
taken from their mouths.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.511
Governors, senators, mayors,
city council members --

00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.399
if we're going to call
public education public education,

00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.006
then it should be just that.

00:11:55.555 --> 00:11:58.538
Otherwise, we should
call it what it really is:

00:11:58.562 --> 00:12:00.127
poverty insurance.

00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:02.653
"Public education:

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:05.765
keeping poor kids poor since 1954."

00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:07.241
(Laughter)

00:12:08.733 --> 00:12:13.831
If we really, as a country, believe
that education is the "great equalizer,"

00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:17.686
then it should be just that:
equal and equitable.

00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:22.501
Until then, there's no democracy
in our democratic education.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.000
On a mezzo level:

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.842
historically speaking, the education
of the black and brown child

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:32.337
has always depended
on the philanthropy of others.

00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:35.155
And unfortunately, today it still does.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.135
If your son or daughter or niece
or nephew or neighbor

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.722
or little Timmy down the street

00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:44.556
goes to an affluent school,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.754
challenge your school committee
to adopt an impoverished school

00:12:47.778 --> 00:12:49.817
or an impoverished classroom.

00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:53.238
Close the divide by engaging
in communication

00:12:53.262 --> 00:12:55.459
and relationships that matter.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.004
When resources are shared,

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.720
they're not divided;

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:01.201
they're multiplied.

00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:03.710
And on a micro level:

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:05.554
if you're a human being,

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.151
donate.

00:13:07.524 --> 00:13:11.587
Time, money, resources, opportunities --

00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:13.974
whatever is in your heart.

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:17.051
There are websites like DonorsChoose

00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:19.129
that recognize the disparity

00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:21.648
and actually want
to do something about it.

00:13:23.748 --> 00:13:25.952
What is a carpenter with no tools?

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.672
What is an actress with no stage?

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.447
What is a scientist with no laboratory?

00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:34.586
What is a doctor with no equipment?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.515
I'll tell you:

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.434
they're my kids.

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:41.035
Shouldn't they be your kids, too?

00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:43.044
Thank you.

00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:49.273
(Applause)
