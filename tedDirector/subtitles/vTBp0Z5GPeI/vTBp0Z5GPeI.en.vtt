00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:20.453
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:25.821
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.518
and that means that I spend a good amount of time

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:33.892
designing and building new pieces of technology,

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:38.432
and more specifically designing and building electronics.

00:00:38.432 --> 00:00:42.790
And what I've found is that the process of designing

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.384
and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:53.225
So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.665
and the outcome of that process,

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:58.081
namely electronic circuit boards,

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:01.110
are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.750
So they're really small, generally, they're square

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.115
and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:13.428
just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:17.416
have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:22.077
the process and the outcome of designing electronics.

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:26.165
And so what if you could design and build electronics

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.205
like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:35.870
extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.134
really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.456
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:46.904
all sorts of new possibilities?

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:50.288
I'm going to share with you two projects that are

00:01:50.288 --> 00:01:54.997
investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.

00:01:54.997 --> 00:02:00.734
(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.566
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:07.440
Sticker templates.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.000
Speed x 4.

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.668
Making a switch.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.156
Music: DJ Shadow.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:58.752
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:15.494
Sketching an interface.

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:27.327
(Music)

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:33.065
(Laughter)

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:38.771
(Applause)

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.768
Pretty cool, huh? We think so.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:45.552
So now that we developed these tools

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:49.290
and found these materials that let us do these things,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.458
we started to realize that, essentially, anything

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.842
that we can do with paper, anything that we can do

00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:58.257
with a piece of paper and a pen

00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:00.674
we can now do with electronics.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:03.042
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:06.602
deeper exploration of that possibility.

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:10.466
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:05:40.912
(Music)

00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:46.280
(Applause)

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.080
So the next step for us in this process

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.808
is now to find a way to let all of you

00:05:54.808 --> 00:05:57.704
build things like this,

00:05:57.704 --> 00:06:00.784
and so the way that we're approaching that is by

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:03.391
teaching workshops to people where we explain

00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:06.504
how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:10.246
working to get the tools and the materials and techniques

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:13.996
out into the real world in a variety of ways.

00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:17.580
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.374
and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.

00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:25.374
So thank you very much. (Applause)
