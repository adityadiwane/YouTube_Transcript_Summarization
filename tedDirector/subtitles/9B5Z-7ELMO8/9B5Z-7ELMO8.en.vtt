00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:16.359
So, raise your hand
if you've seen somebody in your city

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.762
standing on a corner,
holding a sign like this.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:23.478
I think we all have.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:24.667
If you're being honest,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.308
at least one time,
have you wondered if they mean it?

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:31.485
If we offered them a job,
would they really take it?

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.990
And what would that job mean
to them in their lives?

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:37.864
Well, this is a story
about what happened in my city

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:39.440
when we decided to find out,

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:43.919
when we decided to think differently
about panhandling,

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.840
and lift people up
through the dignity of work.

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:49.731
We call it, "There's a Better Way."

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:51.697
We call it There's a Better Way

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.759
because I believe there's a better way
to get the money you need

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:56.450
than panhandling on the corner.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.978
I believe there's a better way
to help your brothers and sisters in need

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.335
than handing a few dollars
out the car window.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:06.192
We know there's dignity in work.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.326
We also know that people are much more
likely to invest in themselves

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.990
if they believe that their community
is willing to invest in them first.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.607
And because we're all wired
to be kind and compassionate,

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.136
it always feels good to hand
a couple of dollars to someone

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.361
that is in need.

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:28.054
But if you talk to panhandlers,
many of them will tell you

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:33.268
that your few dollars don't necessarily
go towards feeding the body,

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.298
they go towards feeding an addiction.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.593
There's a better way.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.681
My name is Richard Berry,

00:01:39.705 --> 00:01:42.072
and I have one of the best
jobs in the world.

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:44.530
I get to be the mayor
of a great American city,

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:46.122
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:53.211
I was at lunch on July 17, 2015,
in my great American city,

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:56.217
and on my way back to city hall,

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.432
I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:00.852
As you can see, he's holding a sign,

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.791
and his sign says he wants a job.

00:02:03.493 --> 00:02:05.335
But if you look closer at the picture,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.598
you'll see he's standing
underneath a blue sign,

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:11.734
and that sign says, if you need help,
if you need food or shelter

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:13.015
or you'd like to donate,

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.835
please call 311,
our community service number.

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:22.174
So why is this guy standing
underneath my sign with his sign?

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.454
Well, we wondered
if anybody would call that 311 sign,

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.034
and as it turns out, they did --

00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:28.789
11,000 times people called.

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.877
I put those up in about 30 intersections.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.275
And we did connect them
with food and shelter and services.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.361
But yet he's still standing under my sign

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.267
with a sign that says he wants a job.

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:41.515
It's simple: he wants a job.

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:45.547
So I decided to do
something rare in government.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.422
I decided to make the solution simpler
rather than more complicated.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:52.971
I went back to my office,
I gathered my staff around

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:55.606
and I said, "We're going
to take this man at his word,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.815
and others like him.

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.616
The man says he wants a job,
we're going to give him a job,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.449
and we're going to make our city
an even better place in the meantime."

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.128
You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:07.423
We're a mile high,

00:03:07.447 --> 00:03:09.553
the Sandia Mountains on the east,

00:03:09.577 --> 00:03:12.117
the Rio Grande runs through
the center of the city;

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:15.205
we're the home of the Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.393
On a day like today,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:19.361
you could literally ski this morning
and golf this afternoon.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.742
But there's always something to do --

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.868
always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.561
If you're going to have an initiative
like this in your city,

00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:29.480
you have to ask yourself two questions.

00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:32.174
First one is: Is there anything
left to do in your city?

00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:33.380
And if the answer is no,

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:35.812
would you please give me
your mayor's phone number,

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.159
because I need some advice.

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.190
(Laughter)

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:40.481
But the second question
you have to ask is this:

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:42.869
Are your solutions to panhandling working?

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:45.792
If you're like Albuquerque,

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:48.462
and you're taking the punitive
approach like we used to,

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:51.620
handing out tickets to panhandlers
or those who give them money,

00:03:51.644 --> 00:03:54.318
I'm going to suggest
that your solutions aren't working,

00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:57.940
and I know you're not getting
to the root of your problem in your city.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.226
So if you have something to do

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.606
and you need people
that need something to do,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.840
there's a better way.

00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:07.167
And the good news is,
it's not that complicated.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.136
This a 2006 Dodge van.

00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:13.146
It was in my motor pool
not doing anything.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.112
We put some new tires on it,
wrapped it with a logo.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:19.931
This van now goes out to street corners
where our panhandlers are --

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:21.144
we go to them.

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:23.122
We stop the van, we get out,

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:25.178
we ask them if they
would like a day's work

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.161
rather than panhandling for the day.

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:30.520
And if you wondered
if they really mean it --

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:34.712
it takes us about an hour
to fill this van up in the morning,

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:38.155
because almost everybody we ask
takes a job for the day.

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:40.855
But you need more than just a van.

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:44.331
You need a super-fantastic
human being to drive that van.

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:47.766
And my super-fantastic human being,
his name is Will.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.561
This is him in the yellow vest.

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:52.119
Will works at our local nonprofit partner.

00:04:52.143 --> 00:04:53.966
He works with the homeless every day.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.719
The panhandlers trust him,

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.892
he believes in them,

00:04:58.523 --> 00:04:59.738
he hustles.

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:02.738
I like to say, "Where
there's a Will, there's a way."

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:06.140
So if you're going to do
the Better Way campaign in your city,

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:07.816
you need to find yourself a Will,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.817
because he's really one of the keys
to making this successful

00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:14.441
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:16.652
You also need a great nonprofit partner.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:19.199
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:21.732
They've been in our community
for over 30 years.

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:24.269
They provide counseling, food, shelter,

00:05:24.293 --> 00:05:25.696
and if they don't provide it,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.736
they know somebody in our city that does.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.813
But they do something much more
for me as the mayor.

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:32.472
They provide agility.

00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:34.709
You see, it takes me two weeks,

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.503
maybe two months sometimes,

00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:39.062
to onboard an employee
with the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:41.599
So you could imagine --

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:42.792
my old Dodge van,

00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:45.126
my super-fantastic human being, Will,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.045
a great local nonprofit partner --

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.303
they drive to the corner,
there's a panhandler,

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:51.581
they say, "Would you like
to work for the day?"

00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:52.901
The panhandler says, "Yes,"

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:56.073
and Will says, "Great! I'll be back
in six weeks to pick you up."

00:05:56.097 --> 00:05:57.120
(Laughter)

00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:58.295
It wouldn't work.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.558
It's really important that we have
that agility in our program.

00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:04.256
And they do the paperwork,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.804
they do the insurance,

00:06:05.828 --> 00:06:09.149
they do all of the other forms
that I can't do quickly.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.769
We pay our panhandlers
nine dollars an hour.

00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:14.046
We feed them once at the jobsite.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.223
At the end of the day,

00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:17.899
our old Dodge van takes them
right back to St. Martin's,

00:06:17.923 --> 00:06:20.267
and they get connected
with counseling services.

00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:22.785
So far,

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.291
with the pilot program
and a couple days a week,

00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:27.978
and a fantastic human being
and a Dodge van,

00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:31.398
we've cleaned up 400 city blocks
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:06:31.422 --> 00:06:35.905
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds
of trash, weeds and litter.

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.252
I don't know if you've ever
weighed a tumbleweed,

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:39.557
but they don't weigh much,

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:43.385
so you can imagine the volume
of material that we've picked up.

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.358
My city has 6,000 employees,

00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.627
and none better
than my solid waste department.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:52.357
We send our trucks out
at the end of the day,

00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:54.613
they help the panhandlers
put into the truck

00:06:54.637 --> 00:06:56.880
the material they've picked up
during the day,

00:06:56.904 --> 00:06:58.407
and we take it to the landfill.

00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.195
I'm lucky that I have city employees

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.160
that are willing to work side by side
with our panhandlers.

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:06.170
They're lifting up our city
while lifting up their lives.

00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:09.260
And like anything else --
listen, it takes resources.

00:07:09.284 --> 00:07:12.012
But the good news is it doesn't take much.

00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:14.840
We started with an old van,

00:07:14.864 --> 00:07:16.602
a super-fantastic human being,

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:17.920
a great local nonprofit

00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:19.540
and $50,000.

00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:22.634
But we also had to have community trust.

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:26.205
And fortunately, we had built
that up in years prior to Better Way.

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.288
We have a program called
"Albuquerque Heading Home,"

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:32.356
a Housing First model where we house
the chronically homeless,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.465
and when I told my community
we wanted to do that differently,

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:38.146
I said there's a smart way
to do the right thing.

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:42.705
We have now housed 650 chronically
homeless, medically vulnerable --

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.535
frankly, most likely to die
on the streets in our city.

00:07:46.177 --> 00:07:48.546
We commissioned our university,
they studied it.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.224
We could tell the taxpayers,
we can save you 31.6 percent

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:55.823
over the cost of leaving someone
to struggle for survival on the streets.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.248
We've now saved over five million dollars
while housing 650 people.

00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.239
So we had that community trust,

00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:05.478
but we had to have a little bit more
of an honest conversation also

00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:06.989
as a community,

00:08:07.013 --> 00:08:09.039
because we had to get people to understand

00:08:09.063 --> 00:08:11.606
that when they hand
those five dollars out the window,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.026
they might actually be minimizing
their opportunity

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.106
to help the person in need,
and here's why:

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.943
that five dollars might go
to buying some fast food today --

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.469
a lot of times it goes to buying
drugs and alcohol.

00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:24.143
That same five dollars,

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.425
if you gave it to one of our shelters,

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:28.210
could feed seven people today.

00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:32.516
And if you gave it to one of our local
food banks or food pantries,

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.050
we could actually feed
20 people with that money.

00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:42.559
People ask,"Well, Albuquerque
is 600,000 people -- million, metro --

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:45.674
this wouldn't work in our city,
we're too big, we're too small."

00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:48.393
I disagree; if you have
one panhandler on one city block,

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:49.573
you can do this.

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:52.215
If you live in a city
of eight-and-half million people,

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:53.394
you can do this.

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:54.895
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:57.781
It's not the work that you do,
it's the dignity of the work.

00:08:57.805 --> 00:08:58.963
You could do anything.

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:01.087
So I think any city could do this.

00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.310
And people say to me,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.398
"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:07.281
It can't work that way."

00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:08.854
But I tell you what, friends:

00:09:08.878 --> 00:09:10.321
when you go to a street corner

00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:13.273
and you engage with a panhandler
with dignity and respect,

00:09:13.297 --> 00:09:15.997
maybe for the first time in years,
maybe in their life,

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.076
and you tell them that you believe in them

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.772
and that this is their city
as much as it's your city,

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:25.563
and that you actually need their help
to make our place better,

00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:28.905
and you understand that this
isn't the answer to all their problems,

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:30.847
but at least it's a start,

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.513
an amazing thing happens.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:36.419
When they get out on the jobsite
and they start working together,

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.340
you start seeing amazing things happen.

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:41.667
They see teamwork; they see
the fact that they can make a difference.

00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:42.932
And at the end of the day,

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:45.652
when they get back to St. Martin's
in that old Dodge van,

00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:49.004
they're much more likely to sign up
for whatever services they need --

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:51.747
substance abuse, mental health
counseling, you name it.

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:54.191
So far with our pilot program,

00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:57.084
we've offered
about 1,700 days of day work.

00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:01.224
We've connected 216 people
to permanent employment opportunities.

00:10:01.687 --> 00:10:05.358
Twenty people actually qualified
for our Housing First model,

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:06.560
Heading Home,

00:10:06.584 --> 00:10:07.743
and they've been housed.

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:09.926
And over 150 people have been connected

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.768
to mental health substance abuse services

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.488
through There's a Better Way.

00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:17.149
This is me just two weeks ago,

00:10:18.758 --> 00:10:19.926
at St. Martin's,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.402
doing our point-in-time survey

00:10:21.426 --> 00:10:22.803
that we do every two years.

00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:26.782
I'm interviewing a gentleman
who's homeless, like we do,

00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:29.550
getting his information,
figuring out where he's from,

00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:31.302
how he got there,

00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.929
what we can do to help him.

00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:36.924
And you notice he's holding the same sign
that the guy was holding in 2015,

00:10:36.948 --> 00:10:39.051
same sign I walked out with here today.

00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:42.959
So you have to ask yourself:
Is it really making a difference?

00:10:42.983 --> 00:10:44.992
Absolutely it's making a difference.

00:10:45.016 --> 00:10:47.674
Albuquerque is now
one of the national leaders

00:10:47.698 --> 00:10:50.924
in combating some of the most stubborn
and persistent social issues

00:10:50.948 --> 00:10:52.099
that we have.

00:10:52.123 --> 00:10:54.002
Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:55.217
the Better Way program,

00:10:55.241 --> 00:10:58.181
Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered
homelessness in our city

00:10:58.205 --> 00:11:00.191
by 80 percent last year.

00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:02.537
Since I took over as mayor,

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.825
we've been able to reduce the chronic
homeless population in our city

00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:07.078
by 40 percent.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.265
And by HUD's definition,

00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:10.982
we've gotten to functional zero,

00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:13.654
which means we've literally ended
veteran homelessness

00:11:13.678 --> 00:11:15.018
in the city of Albuquerque,

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.472
by being intentional.

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:19.802
(Applause)

00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:25.988
So I'm happy to report
that other cities are hearing about this,

00:11:26.012 --> 00:11:27.556
other mayors are calling us --

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.303
Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --

00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:32.863
and are now starting to implement programs

00:11:32.887 --> 00:11:35.962
where they bring the dignity
of work to the equation.

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.841
And I can't wait to learn from them.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:40.542
I can't wait to see
what their experiment looks like,

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.601
what their pilot project looks like,

00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:45.198
so we can start taking
a collective approach nationally

00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:46.598
through the dignity of work.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.003
And I want to commend them --

00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:50.438
the mayors, their communities,
their nonprofits --

00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:52.062
for the work that they're doing.

00:11:52.674 --> 00:11:53.973
So who's next?

00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.764
Are you and your city ready to step up?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.277
Are you ready to think differently
about these persistent social issues?

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.096
Are you ready to lift people up
in your community

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.049
through the dignity of work,

00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:10.042
and make your city
profoundly better in many ways?

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:14.329
Well, if you are, my friends,
I promise you there is a better way.

00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:15.511
Thank you.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:18.939
(Applause)
