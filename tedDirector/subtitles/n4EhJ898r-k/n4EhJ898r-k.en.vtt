00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So a couple of years ago I started a program

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.260
to try to get the rockstar tech and design people

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
to take a year off

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
and work in the one environment

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
we have them work in government.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The program is called Code for America,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
We select a few fellows every year

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and we have them work with city governments.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
we send them into the wilds of City Hall.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
with technology today.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So meet Al.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
when he's covered in four feet of snow.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Now how did he come to be looking for help

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
in this very unique manner?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
through the Code for America program.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And they noticed that the city never gets

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
to digging out these fire hydrants.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
But one fellow in particular,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
noticed something else,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
right in front of these things.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So he did what any good developer would do,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
he wrote an app.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
If you do, you get to name it,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and he called the first one Al.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
This is a modest little app.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
It's probably the smallest

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
But it's doing something

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
that no other government technology does.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It's spreading virally.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
who saw this app and realized

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that he could use it, not for snow,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
but people steal the batteries out of them.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
So he's getting citizens to check on them.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And then Seattle decided to use it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And Chicago just rolled it out

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So we now know of nine cities

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
that are planning to use this.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
And this has spread just frictionlessly,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
organically, naturally.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
If you know anything about government technology,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
you know that this isn't how it normally goes.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
that took three people about two and a half months.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
It was a way that parents could figure out

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
which were the right public schools for their kids.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
it would have taken at least two years

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and it would have cost about two million dollars.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And that's nothing.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
There is one project in the California court system right now

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that so far cost taxpayers

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
two billion dollars,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
and it doesn't work.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And there are projects like this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
at every level of government.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
So an app that takes a couple of days to write

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and then spreads virally,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that's sort of a shot across the bow

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to the institution of government.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
It suggests how government could work better --

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
not more like a private company,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
as many people think it should.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And not even like a tech company,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but more like the Internet itself.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And that means permissionless,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
it means open, it means generative.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And that's important.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
But what's more important about this app

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
is that it represents how a new generation

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
is tackling the problem of government --

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
not as the problem of an ossified institution,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
but as a problem of collective action.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And that's great news,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
with digital technology.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
Now there's a very large community of people

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that are building the tools that we need

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
to do things together effectively.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
It's not just Code for America fellows,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
there are hundreds of people all over the country

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
that are standing and writing civic apps

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
every day in their own communities.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
They haven't given up on government.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
They are frustrated as hell with it,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
but they're not complaining about it,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
they're fixing it.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
And these folks know something

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
that we've lost sight of.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
about politics and the line at the DMV

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and all those other things

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that we're really mad about,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
government is, at its core,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
in the words of Tim O'Reilly,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
"What we do together that we can't do alone."

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Now a lot of people have given up on government.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And if you're one of those people,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
I would ask that you reconsider,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
because things are changing.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Politics is not changing;

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
government is changing.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
And because government

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
ultimately derives its power from us --

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
remember "We the people?" --

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
how we think about it

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is going to effect how that change happens.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
And like a lot of people,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
that, especially local government,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
is about opossums.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
This is the call center for the services and information line.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
It's generally where you will get

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
if you call 311 in your city.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
If you should ever have the chance

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
to staff your city's call center,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
in fact, they all do that --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
you will find that people call government

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
with a very wide range of issues,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
including having an opossum stuck in your house.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So Scott gets this call.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and play music really loud

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and see if the thing leaves?"

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So that worked. So booya for Scott.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Boston doesn't just have a call center.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
It has an app, a Web and mobile app,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
called Citizens Connect.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Now we didn't write this app.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
This is the work of the very smart people

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
How do I get this removed?"

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
But on Citizens Connect everything is public,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
so everybody can see this.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And the next report we got said,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
"I walked over to this location,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
found the trashcan behind the house.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Goodnight sweet opossum."

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
(Laughter)

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Pretty simple.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And it's also a great example

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And I don't mean necessarily

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
a technological definition of platform here.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
I'm just talking about a platform for people

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
to help themselves and to help others.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So one citizen helped another citizen,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
but government played a key role here.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
It connected those two people.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
to government services.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
When one neighbor helps another,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
we strengthen our communities.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
Now one of the important things we need to think about government

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
is that it's not the same thing as politics.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
And most people get that,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
but they think that one is the input to the other.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
That our input to the system of government

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
is voting.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
Now how many times have we elected a political leader --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and sometimes we spend a lot of energy

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
getting a new political leader elected --

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and then we sit back and we expect government

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.260
to reflect our values and meet our needs,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.260
and then not that much changes?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
That's because government is like a vast ocean

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and politics is the six-inch layer on top.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
And what's under that

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
is what we call bureaucracy.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And we say that word with such contempt.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
But it's that contempt

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that keeps this thing that we own

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and we pay for

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
as something that's working against us, this other thing,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and then we're disempowering ourselves.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
People seem to think politics is sexy.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
If we want this institution to work for us,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Because that's where the real work of government happens.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
We have to engage with the machinery of government.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Have you seen these guys?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
It's a group of concerned citizens

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
that have written a very detailed

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
325-page report

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that's a response to the SEC's request for comment

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
on the Financial Reform Bill.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
That's not being politically active,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
that's being bureaucratically active.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Now for those of us who've given up on government,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
it's time that we asked ourselves

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
about the world that we want to leave for our children.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
You have to see the enormous challenges

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
that they're going to face.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
without fixing the one institution

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
that can act on behalf of all of us?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
We can't do without government,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
but we do need it

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
to be more effective.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
The good news is that technology is making it possible

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
to fundamentally reframe

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
the function of government

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
in a way that can actually scale

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
by strengthening civil society.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
and they know that it's not that hard

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to do things together,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.260
you just have to architect the systems the right way.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Now the average age of our fellows is 28,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
so I am, begrudgingly,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
almost a generation older than most of them.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
This is a generation

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
about who gets to speak;

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
they all get to speak.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
They can express their opinion

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
on any channel at any time,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and they do.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
So when they're faced with the problem of government,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
they don't care as much

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
about using their voices.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
They're using their hands.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
They're using their hands

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
to write applications that make government work better.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And those applications let us use our hands

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
to make our communities better.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.260
turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
and many people do.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
But these apps are like little digital reminders

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
that we're not just consumers,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
and we're not just consumers of government,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
putting in our taxes and getting back services.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
We're more than that,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
we're citizens.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And we're not going to fix government

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
until we fix citizenship.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
So the question I have for all of you here:

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
When it comes to the big, important things

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that we need to do together,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
all of us together,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
are we just going to be a crowd of voices,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
or are we also going to be

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
a crowd of hands?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Thank you.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:12:04.260
(Applause)
