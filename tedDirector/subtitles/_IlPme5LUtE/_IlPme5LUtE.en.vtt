00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
And it's an African story.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330
There was Hollywood.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
Then came Bollywood.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.330
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:57.330
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.330
in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.330
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
And it's expanding.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.330
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.330
This is something that happened without foreign investment,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.330
without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.330
in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
The industry is 15 years old.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.330
And so maybe you're thinking now,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
is so interested in this story?

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
a few things about my personal life,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.330
because I think there is a connection.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.330
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.330
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And I was born in Zambia.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Even though I left when I was only three years old,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And it really was a place where I learned to walk.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
I think I uttered the first words,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
and my family bought their first home.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
So when we came back to Italy,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and one of the things that I remember the most

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.330
is my family having this hard time to share stories.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
that probably exists only in their imagination,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
or the place of horror, famine.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.330
And so we were always caught in this stereotype.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
and have dreams like we all have.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.330
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
the story of Nollywood,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.330
I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.330
that goes against all these preconceived notions.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.330
Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.330
and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.330
at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.330
And we really look how digital technology is changing,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
and how young, independent filmmakers

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
can make movies at a fraction of the cost.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
So when I proposed the story,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
I really had all the support to make this film.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.330
And not only had the support,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.330
I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.330
who is a veteran of National Geographic,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.330
and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
I don't know if I have come across a story

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.330
that is so full of hope and so fun."

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.330
So we went to Lagos in October 2005.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.330
a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
of this incredible film industry,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
following Bond in his quest to make an action movie

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
that deals with the issue of corruption,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
called "Checkpoint."

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
Police corruption.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
And he had nine days to make it.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
We thought this was a good story.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
But I don't want to create too many expectations.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.330
I would like to show you six minutes.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.330
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
There are several themes from the documentary,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
So I guess it's a world premier.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
(Video)

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.330
Man: Action.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
And you shoot in seven days.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Peace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
We're not doing films for the elite

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
and the people in their glass houses.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.330
is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
and where you have big budgets.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
Here is that you make these films,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.330
it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.330
I believe in the power of audiovisuals.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
I think it's the most viable vehicle right now

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
to pass information across a dedicated cable.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
put in a message in there.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
Woman: You still have to report the incident.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
He needs proper medical attention.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.330
PP: I keep trying to explain to people,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.330
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
but the first thing you have to remember about this society

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
and these are the people that really watch these films.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.330
Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
that has just been born in this part of the world.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330
Lancelot Imasen: But our films,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.330
they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
They are stories about our people, for our people.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
And consistently, they are glued to their screen

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
whenever they see the story.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.330
Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
It's the blockbuster comedy.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
You'll crack your ribs.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
It's all about the foreign movies.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
But we can do something too.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.330
We can do something, something that when the world sees it,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
they say, wow, this is Nigeria.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
Don't embarrass yourself.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
It’s not just what you see in picture.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
You see the person live.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
You see how he talks. You see how he lives.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
He influences you really good, you know.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
It’s not just what you see in the picture.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.330
It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
Man: See you. Bye.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Action.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.330
Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
But then when I discovered the situation in my country,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.330
at that time there was so much corruption.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.330
For a young man to really make it out here,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.330
you got to think of some negative things and all that,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
or some kind of vices.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.330
And I didn't want that, you know.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.330
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.330
without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
Just me and God-given talent.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.330
Man: Let's go.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.330
OK, it's time to kick some ass.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
Cover this. It's your own.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
Move it.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.330
they have all these things in place.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.330
But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.330
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
The masking tape will hold it.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.330
But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
I'm trying to protect my face too.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
This ain't going to be my last movie.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.330
RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
with or without any assistance from anybody.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.330
Man: Action.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
Cut.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:33.330
(Applause)

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.330
Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
So many themes in this story.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.330
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.330
and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.330
for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.330
But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
that is incredible.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.330
"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
And I think they’re breathing.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.330
The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
And so it's a very, very important thing for them,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.330
and for their audiences.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.330
A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.330
I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better."

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
There is also another very important thing

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
that I hope will resonate with this audience.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:37.330
and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.330
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
And this has unleashed tremendous energy.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
And guess what?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330
They understood it, they embraced the technology

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
and they run with it, and they’re successful.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.330
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.330
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.330
create a narrative for the population, something to identify,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.330
something positive, something that really is psychological relief

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
and it's part of the culture.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.330
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
I really think it goes both ways.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.330
Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
and make a buck and live with this job."

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.330
So I really think it’s a lesson

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
that we're actually learning from them.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
And there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
And I think this is really the theme of this session.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:58.330
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
No stories around the campfire.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
No legends, no fairytales.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
Nothing.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.330
No novels.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
Difficult, eh? It's meaningless.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
So this is what I really think.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.330
I think that the key to a healthy society

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
is a thriving community of storytellers,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:25.330
and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.330
I would like you to hear their voices.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.330
Just a few moments.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.330
It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.330
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
that’s Nollywood.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
we'll have that original Nigerian movie.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
BE: It’s still the same basic themes.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.330
Love, action.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.330
But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.330
We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.330
that in the natal lifetimes,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.330
I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:23.330
FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.330
And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
where we teach each other things.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
And I really hope that this will happen.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.330
Thank you very much.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.330
(Applause)

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.330
Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.330
Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.330
FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
There is scientific data on this.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.330
CA: 2,000 films a year?

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:07.330
the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
And we know that there are more.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
So imagine 45 films per week.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.330
There are challenges. There are challenges.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.330
There is a glut of film,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
but I’m optimistic.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.330
CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:36.330
these are films that are distributed directly in markets.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
They are bought in video shops.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.330
They can be rented for pennies.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.330
CA: On what format?

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.330
They started with VHS.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.330
They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.330
They started in '92, '94.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.330
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.330
that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.330
CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.330
and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
(Laughter)

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.330
And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.330
it's a commodity, it's a staple.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.330
There is no life without stories.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.330
CA: Franco, thank you so much.
