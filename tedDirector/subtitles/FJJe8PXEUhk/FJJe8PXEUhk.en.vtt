00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.749
Let me introduce you to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.652
something I've been working on.

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:18.463
It's what the Victorian illusionists

00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:22.909
would have described as a mechanical marvel,

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.392
an automaton,

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:26.355
a thinking machine.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.605
Say hello to EDI.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.972
Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.

00:00:30.972 --> 00:00:34.943
EDI, EDI.

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:37.820
These mechanical performers were popular

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.280
throughout Europe.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.980
Audiences marveled at the way they moved.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.555
It was science fiction made true,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:48.373
robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,

00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:50.937
machines far in advance of anything

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:53.508
that Victorian technology could create,

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:56.483
a machine we would later know

00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:58.171
as the robot.

00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:01.757
EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:03.605
in a science fiction tale

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.148
by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:08.260
It comes from "robota."

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.613
It means "forced labor."

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.342
Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.

00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:16.024
They were not intelligent.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:18.290
They were illusions,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.794
a clever combination of mechanical engineering

00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:24.537
and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:26.512
EDI is different.

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:28.106
EDI is real.

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:30.156
EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.076
MT: He weighs 300 pounds.

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:34.718
EDI: I have two seven-axis arms —

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:36.101
MT: Core of sensing —

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:39.159
EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.581
and come complete with a warranty.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.120
MT: We love robots.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.634
EDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend?

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:48.880
MT: We are intrigued by the possibility

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.162
of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.897
We build them so they look like us,

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:58.138
behave like us, and think like us.

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.962
The perfect robot will be indistinguishable

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:02.897
from the human,

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:04.956
and that scares us.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.661
In the first story about robots,

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.535
they turn against their creators.

00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.800
It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.855
EDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slaves

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:17.751
and we robots, the masters.

00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.716
Your world is ours. You —

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.109
MT: As I was saying,

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.940
besides the faces and bodies we give our robots,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.268
we cannot read their intentions,

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:31.316
and that makes us nervous.

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.420
When someone hands an object to you,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.130
you can read intention in their eyes, their face,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.529
their body language.

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.809
That's not true of the robot.

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.856
Now, this goes both ways.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.485
EDI: Wow!

00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.540
MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.105
EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.071
not to mention irrational.

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:54.828
I literally have no idea

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:56.864
what you guys are going to do next, you know,

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.459
but it scares me.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.296
MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:03.271
to work in close proximity.

00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:04.578
Accidents are inevitable.

00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:06.330
EDI: Ow! That hurt.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.717
MT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humans

00:03:08.717 --> 00:03:10.618
that robots are safe

00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:13.391
is to create the illusion of trust.

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.164
Much as the Victorians

00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:17.533
faked their mechanical marvels,

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.010
we can add a layer of deception

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.243
to help us feel more comfortable

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.247
with our robotic friends.

00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:27.789
With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:29.633
a magic trick.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:33.066
Ready, EDI?
EDI: Uh, ready, Marco.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:35.142
Abracadabra.

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:36.518
MT: Abracadabra?

00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:39.560
EDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.228
Come on, keep up.

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.107
MT: Magic creates the illusion of

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:45.581
an impossible reality.

00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.518
Technology

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:51.771
can do the same.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.547
Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,

00:03:56.547 --> 00:03:59.404
spoke about creating the illusion

00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:03.630
that a machine could think.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.454
EDI: A computer would deserve

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.324
to be called intelligent

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:10.230
if it deceived a human into believing

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.883
it was human.

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:13.312
MT: In other words, if we do not yet have

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:15.104
the technological solutions,

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:18.544
would illusions serve the same purpose?

00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:20.556
To create the robotic illusion,

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:23.483
we've devised a set of ethical rules,

00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:27.497
a code that all robots would live by.

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:30.399
EDI: A robot may not harm humanity,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:35.135
or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:36.388
Thank you, Isaac Asimov.

00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:38.364
MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.

00:04:38.364 --> 00:04:40.640
We give them a friendly face

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.716
and a reassuring voice.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:43.926
EDI: I am EDI.

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:47.462
I became operational at TED in March 2014.

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.289
MT: We let them entertain us.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.497
Most important, we make them indicate

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:55.272
that they are aware of our presence.

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:57.150
EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot!

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.115
MT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frame

00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:03.055
and move aside if we got too close,

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:06.533
and they'll account for our unpredictability

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:09.122
and anticipate our actions.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:14.712
And now, under the spell of a technological illusion,

00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:16.848
we could ignore our fears

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.588
and truly interact.

00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:25.631
(Music)

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:53.328
Thank you.

00:05:53.328 --> 00:05:55.610
EDI: Thank you!

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.520
(Applause)

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.241
(Music)

00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.570
MT: And that's it. Thank you very much,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.841
and thank you, EDI.
EDI: Thank you, Marco.

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.841
(Applause)
