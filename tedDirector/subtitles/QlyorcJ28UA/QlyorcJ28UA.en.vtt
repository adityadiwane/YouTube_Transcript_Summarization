00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.656
I'd like to talk to you today
about the scale of the scientific effort

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.360
that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper.

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:25.733
Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change;

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:28.603
and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:31.567
They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.523
Recently, the headlines looked like this

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.389
when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC,

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:37.564
put out their report

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:40.225
on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.230
That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:45.755
They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.523
and all of those pages were reviewed

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.674
by another 400-plus
scientists and reviewers

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.392
from 113 countries.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:52.682
It's a big community;

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.164
such a big community, in fact,

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:57.643
that our annual gathering is the largest
scientific meeting in the world.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.621
Over 15,000 scientists go
to San Francisco every year for that.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.252
Every one of those scientists
is in a research group,

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.005
and every research group studies
a wide variety of topics.

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:09.003
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied
as the El NiÃ±o Oscillation,

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.691
which affects weather and climate,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.547
to the assimilation of satellite data,

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.830
to emissions from crops that produce
biofuels, which is what I study.

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:19.172
And in each one of these research areas,
of which there are even more,

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:22.556
there are PhD students, like me,
and we study incredibly narrow topics,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.177
things as narrow as a few processes
or a few molecules.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.415
And one of the molecules I study
is called isoprene, which is here.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.086
It's a small organic molecule.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.754
You've probably never heard of it.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.180
The weight of a paper clip
is approximately equal

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:37.835
to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --
molecules of isoprene.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.958
But despite its very small weight,

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.538
enough of it is emitted
into the atmosphere every year

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:45.038
to equal the weight
of all the people on the planet.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:48.119
It's a huge amount of stuff.
It's equal to the weight of methane.

00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:49.624
And because it's so much stuff,

00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:51.962
it's really important
for the atmospheric system.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:54.282
Because it's important
to the atmospheric system,

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:56.263
we go to all lengths to study this thing.

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:58.058
We blow it up and look at the pieces.

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.090
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.138
Atmospheric explosions,
or full combustion,

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:05.072
takes about 15,000 times longer
than what happens in your car.

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:06.676
But still, we look at the pieces.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.045
We run enormous models on supercomputers;
this is what I happen to do.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.564
Our models have hundreds
of thousands of grid boxes

00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:15.595
calculating hundreds of variables
each, on minute timescales.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.675
It takes weeks to perform
our integrations,

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.413
and we perform dozens of integrations
in order to understand what's happening.

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:24.206
We also fly all over the world
looking for this thing.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.411
I recently joined a field campaign
in Malaysia -- there are others.

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:29.634
We found a global atmospheric
watchtower there

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:31.212
in the middle of the rainforest,

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:34.639
and hung hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of scientific equipment

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:35.814
off this tower,

00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.604
to look for isoprene and other things
while we were there.

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:41.503
This is the tower in the middle
of the rainforest from above,

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:42.727
and the tower from below.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.942
On part of that field campaign
we even brought an aircraft with us.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.633
And this plane, the model BAe-146,
which was run by FAAM,

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:50.701
normally flies 120 to 130 people,

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.310
so maybe you took a similar aircraft
to get here today.

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:54.586
But we didn't just fly it.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.303
We were flying at 100 meters
above the top of the canopy

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.950
to measure this molecule --
incredibly dangerous stuff.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:02.867
We have to fly at a special incline
to make the measurements;

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.482
we hire military and test pilots
to do the maneuvering;

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.110
we need special flight clearance.

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:09.287
As you come around the banks
in these valleys,

00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.847
the forces can get up to two Gs;

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.031
the scientists must be
completely harnessed in

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.154
in order to make measurements
while on board.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:16.332
So as you can imagine,

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:19.763
the inside of the aircraft doesn't look
like one you'd take on vacation.

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:23.333
It's a flying laboratory we took
to make measurements of this molecule.

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.443
We do all this to understand
the chemistry of one molecule.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.151
And when one student like me
has some sort of inclination

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.976
or understanding about that molecule,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.217
they write one scientific paper
on the subject.

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:36.461
And out of that field campaign
we'll probably get a few dozen papers

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:38.322
on a few dozen processes or molecules.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:41.292
As a body of knowledge builds up,
it will form one subsection,

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:42.467
or one sub-subsection,

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.781
of an assessment like the IPCC,
although we have others.

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:50.741
And each one of the 11 chapters
of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:52.805
So you can imagine
the scale of the effort.

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.492
In each one of the assessments we write,
we always tag on a summary,

00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:59.198
and the summary is written
for a non-scientific audience.

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:01.962
And we hand that summary
to journalists and policy makers

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.856
in order to make headlines like these.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:05.911
Thank you very much.

00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:07.761
(Applause)
