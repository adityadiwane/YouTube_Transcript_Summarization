00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.027
The philosopher Plato once said,

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.800
"Music gives a soul to the universe,

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:20.418
wings to the mind,

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.464
flight to the imagination

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.446
and life to everything."

00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:27.901
Music has always been
a big part of my life.

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:30.295
To create and to perform music

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.164
connects you to people
countries and lifetimes away.

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:35.950
It connects you to the people
you're playing with,

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.162
to your audience

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:38.513
and to yourself.

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:41.103
When I'm happy, when I'm sad,

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:43.327
when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.921
I listen to and I create music.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.807
When I was younger, I played piano;

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.228
later, I took up guitar.

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:53.085
And as I started high school,

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.023
music became a part of my identity.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.746
I was in every band,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.396
I was involved with every
musical fine arts event.

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:01.385
Music surrounded me.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.764
It made me who I was,

00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:04.898
and it gave me a place to belong.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.573
Now, I've always had
this thing with rhythms.

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:09.766
I remember being young,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.854
I would walk down
the hallways of my school

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.868
and I would tap rhythms to myself
on my leg with my hands,

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:16.612
or tapping my teeth.

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:18.983
It was a nervous habit,

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:20.290
and I was always nervous.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.946
I think I liked the repetition
of the rhythm --

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.330
it was calming.

00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:26.927
Then in high school,

00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:28.464
I started music theory,

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.718
and it was the best class I've ever taken.

00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:32.276
We were learning about music --

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.989
things I didn't know,
like theory and history.

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:39.056
It was a class where we basically
just listened to a song,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.708
talked about what it meant to us

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:41.918
and analyzed it,

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:44.408
and figured out what made it tick.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.590
Every Wednesday, we did something
called "rhythmic dictation,"

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.016
and I was pretty good at it.

00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:52.847
Our teacher would give us
an amount of measures

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:54.364
and a time signature,

00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:56.252
and then he would speak a rhythm to us

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:59.692
and we would have to write it down
with the proper rests and notes.

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:01.503
Like this:

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:04.919
ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,

00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:07.496
ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.

00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:09.957
And I loved it.

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:11.459
The simplicity of the rhythm --

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:13.641
a basic two- to four- measure line --

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.469
and yet each of them almost told a story,

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:19.724
like they had so much potential,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.264
and all you had to do was add a melody.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.302
(Guitar)

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:37.407
Rhythms set a foundation for melodies
and harmonies to play on top of.

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:39.985
It gives structure and stability.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.020
Now, music has these parts --

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:45.179
rhythm, melody and harmony --

00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:46.684
just like our lives.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.408
Where music has rhythm,

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:51.686
we have routines and habits --

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.975
things that help us to remember
what to do and to stay on track,

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.878
and to just keep going.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.875
And you may not notice it,

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.222
but it's always there.

00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:04.855
(Guitar)

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.696
And it may seem simple,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.417
it may seem dull by itself,

00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:13.721
but it gives tempo and heartbeat.

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:17.876
And then things in your life add on to it,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.111
giving texture --

00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:21.479
that's your friends and your family,

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:25.139
and anything that creates
a harmonic structure in your life

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.748
and in your song,

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.434
like harmonies,

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.615
cadences

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.935
and anything that makes it polyphonic.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:36.585
And they create beautiful
chords and patterns.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.194
(Guitar)

00:03:39.174 --> 00:03:40.763
And then there's you.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.171
You play on top of everything else,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.155
on top of the rhythms and the beat

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.308
because you're the melody.

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:56.155
And things may change and develop,

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:58.606
but no matter what we do,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.248
we're still the same people.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.111
Throughout a song melodies develop,

00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:05.835
but it's still the same song.

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:08.857
No matter what you do,

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.807
the rhythms are still there:

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:13.957
the tempo and the heartbeat ...

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.480
until I left,

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:20.564
and I went to college

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:22.061
and everything disappeared.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.630
When I first arrived at university,

00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:27.879
I felt lost.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.564
And don't get me wrong --
sometimes I loved it and it was great,

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:32.968
but other times,

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:36.453
I felt like I had been left alone

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.207
to fend for myself.

00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.237
It's like I had been taken out
of my natural environment,

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:44.606
and put somewhere new,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.462
where the rhythms and the harmonies

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:50.143
and the form had gone away,

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.827
and it was just me --

00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:54.176
(Guitar)

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.473
silence and my melody.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.245
And even that began to waver,

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.221
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:05:04.894 --> 00:05:07.290
I didn't have any chords
to structure myself,

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:09.367
or a rhythm

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.787
or a beat to know the tempo.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.281
(Guitar)

00:05:15.305 --> 00:05:17.617
And then I began to hear
all these other sounds.

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:18.987
(Guitar)

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.299
And they were off-time

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:23.954
and off-key.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:28.332
And the more I was around them,

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:32.689
the more my melody started
to sound like theirs.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.247
And slowly I began to lose myself,

00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:41.777
like I was being washed away.

00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:46.501
But then the next moment --

00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:48.511
(Guitar)

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:50.028
I could hear it.

00:05:51.454 --> 00:05:52.875
And I could feel it.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.322
And it was me.

00:05:57.284 --> 00:05:58.510
And I was here.

00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.089
And it was different,

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.054
but not worse off.

00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:08.515
Just changed a little.

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:14.631
Music is my way of coping
with the changes in my life.

00:06:16.258 --> 00:06:18.907
There's a beautiful connection
between music and life.

00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:20.613
It can bind us to reality

00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:23.029
at the same time
it allows us to escape it.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:25.573
Music is something
that lives inside of you.

00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:28.247
You create it and you're created by it.

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:32.659
Our lives are not only conducted by music,

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.314
they're also composed of it.

00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:37.460
So this may seem like a bit of a stretch,

00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.051
but hear me out:

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:42.665
music is a fundamental part of what we are

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.162
and of everything around us.

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:46.516
Now, music is my passion,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.967
but physics also used to be
an interest of mine.

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:50.626
And the more I learned,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.879
the more I saw connections
between the two --

00:06:53.498 --> 00:06:55.369
especially regarding string theory.

00:06:57.095 --> 00:06:59.833
I know this is only one of many theories,

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:01.363
but it spoke to me.

00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:07.107
So, one aspect of string theory,
at its simplest form, is this:

00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.157
matter is made up of atoms,

00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:12.399
which are made up of protons
and neutrons and electrons,

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:14.149
which are made up of quark.

00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:16.206
And here's where the string part comes in.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.761
This quark is supposedly made up
of little coiled strings,

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:24.704
and it's the vibrations of these strings
that make everything what it is.

00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.122
Michio Kaku once explained this

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:30.078
in a lecture called,
"The Universe in a Nutshell,"

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:31.477
where he says,

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:34.564
"String theory is the simple idea

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:36.616
that the four forces of the universe --

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.826
gravity, the electromagnetic force,
and the two strong forces --

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.825
can be viewed as music.

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.544
The music of tiny little rubber bands."

00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:48.759
In this lecture, he goes on
to explain physics

00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:51.192
as the laws of harmony
between these strings;

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:54.253
chemistry, as the melodies
you can play on these strings;

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:59.078
and he states that the universe
is a "symphony of strings."

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.327
These strings dictate the universe;

00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.884
they make up everything we see
and everything we know.

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:08.118
They're musical notes,

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:10.879
but they make us what we are
and they hold us together.

00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:13.449
So you see,

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:15.648
everything is music.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.655
(Guitar)

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:19.809
When I look at the world,

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.164
I see music all around us.

00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:26.623
When I look at myself,

00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:29.100
I see music.

00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:35.344
And my life has been defined by music.

00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:38.922
I found myself through music.

00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:42.644
Music is everywhere,

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.242
and it is in everything.

00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:51.017
And it changes and it builds

00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:52.517
and it diminishes.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.811
But it's always there,

00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:58.225
supporting us,

00:08:58.249 --> 00:08:59.947
connecting us to each other

00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.203
and showing us the beauty of the universe.

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.466
So if you ever feel lost,

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:09.359
stop and listen for your song.

00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:11.643
Thank you.

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:15.522
(Applause)
