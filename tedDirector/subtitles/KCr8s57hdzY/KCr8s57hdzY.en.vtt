00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:15.113
"Can you taste words?"

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.856
It was a question
that caught me by surprise.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.991
This summer, I was giving a talk
at a literary festival,

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.691
and afterwards, as I was signing books,

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.394
a teenage girl came with her friend,

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.451
and this is what she asked me.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:34.292
I told her that some people
experience an overlap in their senses

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:36.143
so that they could hear colors

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:37.695
or see sounds,

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.157
and many writers were fascinated
by this subject, myself included.

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:48.050
But she cut me off, a bit impatiently,
and said, "Yeah, I know all of that.

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:50.815
It's called synesthesia.
We learned it at school.

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:53.815
But my mom is reading your book,

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.290
and she says there's lots
of food and ingredients

00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.198
and a long dinner scene in it.

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:01.388
She gets hungry at every page.

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:02.958
So I was thinking,

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.214
how come you don't
get hungry when you write?

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:08.806
And I thought maybe,
maybe you could taste words.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.274
Does it make sense?"

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:12.876
And, actually, it did make sense,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.007
because ever since my childhood,

00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:18.704
each letter in the alphabet
has a different color,

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:21.257
and colors bring me flavors.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:26.887
So for instance, the color purple
is quite pungent, almost perfumed,

00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.728
and any words that I associate with purple

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.918
taste the same way,

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:36.763
such as "sunset" -- a very spicy word.

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.969
But I was worried that if I tell
all of this to the teenager,

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:44.143
it might sound either too abstract

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.931
or perhaps too weird,

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:48.695
and there wasn't enough time anyhow,

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.980
because people were waiting in the queue,

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:55.536
so it suddenly felt like
what I was trying to convey

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.609
was more complicated and detailed

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:02.534
than what the circumstances
allowed me to say.

00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:07.619
And I did what I usually do
in similar situations:

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:11.248
I stammered, I shut down,
and I stopped talking.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:15.438
I stopped talking because
the truth was complicated,

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:17.889
even though I knew, deep within,

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:23.701
that one should never, ever
remain silent for fear of complexity.

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:26.203
So I want to start my talk today

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:29.748
with the answer that I was not able
to give on that day.

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:32.069
Yes, I can taste words --

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:34.233
sometimes, that is, not always,

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:38.281
and happy words have
a different flavor than sad words.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:42.972
I like to explore: What does
the word "creativity" taste like,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.010
or "equality,"

00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:47.480
"love," "revolution?"

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:49.638
And what about "motherland?"

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:54.422
These days, it's particularly
this last word that troubles me.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:57.015
It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.425
like cinnamon, a bit of rose water

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:01.849
and golden apples.

00:03:01.873 --> 00:03:05.071
But underneath, there's a sharp tang,

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:07.695
like nettles and dandelion.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.006
The taste of my motherland, Turkey,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.944
is a mixture of sweet and bitter.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.492
And the reason why I'm telling you this

00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:19.939
is because I think
there's more and more people

00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:21.755
all around the world today

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.644
who have similarly mixed emotions

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:26.940
about the lands they come from.

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:29.625
We love our native countries, yeah?

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.849
How can we not?

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:35.314
We feel attached to the people,
the culture, the land, the food.

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:36.530
And yet at the same time,

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:42.236
we feel increasingly frustrated
by its politics and politicians,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.203
sometimes to the point
of despair or hurt or anger.

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:50.036
I want to talk about emotions

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.793
and the need to boost
our emotional intelligence.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.968
I think it's a pity

00:03:54.992 --> 00:04:00.995
that mainstream political theory
pays very little attention to emotions.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.613
Oftentimes, analysts and experts
are so busy with data and metrics

00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:09.574
that they seem to forget
those things in life

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:11.432
that are difficult to measure

00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:16.721
and perhaps impossible to cluster
under statistical models.

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:20.110
But I think this is a mistake,
for two main reasons.

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.976
Firstly, because we are emotional beings.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.523
As human beings,
I think we all are like that.

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:29.221
But secondly, and this is new,

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:32.900
we have entered
a new stage in world history

00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:38.943
in which collective sentiments
guide and misguide politics

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:41.747
more than ever before.

00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.891
And through social media
and social networking,

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:47.801
these sentiments are further amplified,

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:51.551
polarized, and they travel
around the world quite fast.

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:56.050
Ours is the age of anxiety, anger,

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:58.588
distrust, resentment

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:00.236
and, I think, lots of fear.

00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.227
But here's the thing:

00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:07.026
even though there's plenty of research
about economic factors,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.991
there's relatively few studies
about emotional factors.

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:17.159
Why is it that we underestimate
feelings and perceptions?

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:21.173
I think it's going to be one
of our biggest intellectual challenges,

00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:26.497
because our political systems
are replete with emotions.

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:28.327
In country after country,

00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:33.763
we have seen illiberal politicians
exploiting these emotions.

00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:37.405
And yet within the academia
and among the intelligentsia,

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:40.995
we are yet to take emotions seriously.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.293
I think we should.

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:46.182
And just like we should focus
on economic inequality worldwide,

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:52.822
we need to pay more attention
to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:54.656
and how to bridge these gaps,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.083
because they do matter.

00:05:57.554 --> 00:06:00.304
Years ago, when I was still
living in Istanbul,

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:04.364
an American scholar working on
women writers in the Middle East

00:06:04.388 --> 00:06:05.792
came to see me.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.849
And at some point
in our exchange, she said,

00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:10.829
"I understand why you're a feminist,

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:13.818
because, you know, you live in Turkey."

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.507
And I said to her,

00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.779
"I don't understand
why you're not a feminist,

00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:20.055
because, you know, you live in America."

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.599
(Laughter)

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:25.585
(Applause)

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:27.475
And she laughed.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.694
She took it as a joke,

00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:31.537
and the moment passed.

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:33.458
(Laughter)

00:06:33.482 --> 00:06:38.392
But the way she had divided the world
into two imaginary camps,

00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:40.359
into two opposite camps --

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:43.023
it bothered me and it stayed with me.

00:06:43.047 --> 00:06:45.543
According to this imaginary map,

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:49.089
some parts of the world
were liquid countries.

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:52.383
They were like choppy waters
not yet settled.

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:55.718
Some other parts of the world,
namely the West,

00:06:55.742 --> 00:06:59.047
were solid, safe and stable.

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:02.385
So it was the liquid lands
that needed feminism

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.806
and activism and human rights,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.228
and those of us who were
unfortunate enough

00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:09.064
to come from such places

00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:13.862
had to keep struggling
for these most essential values.

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:15.073
But there was hope.

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:16.904
Since history moved forward,

00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:21.317
even the most unsteady lands
would someday catch up.

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.339
And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands

00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:28.535
could take comfort
in the progress of history

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:31.809
and in the triumph of the liberal order.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:35.796
They could support the struggles
of other people elsewhere,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.346
but they themselves
did not have to struggle

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.698
for the basics of democracy anymore,

00:07:42.722 --> 00:07:45.369
because they were beyond that stage.

00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:48.969
I think in the year 2016,

00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:53.311
this hierarchical geography
was shattered to pieces.

00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:58.234
Our world no longer follows
this dualistic pattern

00:07:58.258 --> 00:08:01.367
in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.

00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:06.235
Now we know that history
does not necessarily move forward.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:08.182
Sometimes it draws circles,

00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:10.163
even slides backwards,

00:08:10.187 --> 00:08:13.134
and that generations
can make the same mistakes

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:15.992
that their great-grandfathers had made.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:18.623
And now we know that there's no such thing

00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:22.454
as solid countries
versus liquid countries.

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:26.922
In fact, we are all living
in liquid times,

00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:30.593
just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.

00:08:30.617 --> 00:08:33.809
And Bauman had another
definition for our age.

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:39.475
He used to say we are all going
to be walking on moving sands.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:42.286
And if that's the case, I think,

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.611
it should concern us women more than men,

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:49.725
because when societies
slide backwards into authoritarianism,

00:08:49.749 --> 00:08:52.545
nationalism or religious fanaticism,

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:55.436
women have much more to lose.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.281
That is why this needs
to be a vital moment,

00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.496
not only for global activism,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.379
but in my opinion,
for global sisterhood as well.

00:09:04.403 --> 00:09:09.082
(Applause)

00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:15.903
But I want to make a little confession
before I go any further.

00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:21.108
Until recently, whenever I took part in
an international conference or festival,

00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:25.323
I would be usually one
of the more depressed speakers.

00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:26.605
(Laughter)

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:32.453
Having seen how our dreams of democracy
and how our dreams of coexistence

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.440
were crushed in Turkey,

00:09:34.464 --> 00:09:38.693
both gradually but also
with a bewildering speed,

00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:41.707
over the years I've felt
quite demoralized.

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.844
And at these festivals there would be
some other gloomy writers,

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:50.787
and they would come from places
such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan,

00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:55.277
Bangladesh, Philippines,
China, Venezuela, Russia.

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:58.209
And we would smile
at each other in sympathy,

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:00.330
this camaraderie of the doomed.

00:10:00.354 --> 00:10:02.096
(Laughter)

00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:05.189
And you could call us WADWIC:

00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:09.331
Worried and Depressed
Writers International Club.

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:11.077
(Laughter)

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.872
But then things began to change,

00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:16.859
and suddenly our club became more popular,

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:19.392
and we started to have new members.

00:10:19.416 --> 00:10:20.865
I remember --

00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:22.510
(Laughter)

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:28.074
I remember Greek writers and poets
joined first, came on board.

00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:32.402
And then writers from Hungary and Poland,

00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:37.898
and then, interestingly, writers
from Austria, the Netherlands, France,

00:10:37.922 --> 00:10:42.357
and then writers from the UK,
where I live and where I call my home,

00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:45.316
and then writers from the USA.

00:10:46.487 --> 00:10:48.530
Suddenly, there were more of us

00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:51.337
feeling worried about
the fate of our nations

00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:53.623
and the future of the world.

00:10:53.647 --> 00:10:56.153
And maybe there were more of us now

00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:59.621
feeling like strangers
in our own motherlands.

00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:02.621
And then this bizarre thing happened.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:06.132
Those of us who used to be
very depressed for a long time,

00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:08.878
we started to feel less depressed,

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:12.604
whereas the newcomers,
they were so not used to feeling this way

00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:14.680
that they were now even more depressed.

00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:15.799
(Laughter)

00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:20.661
So you could see writers
from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt

00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:24.115
trying to console their colleagues

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:28.598
from Brexit Britain
or from post-election USA.

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:30.261
(Laughter)

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.297
But joking aside,

00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:36.718
I think our world is full
of unprecedented challenges,

00:11:36.742 --> 00:11:39.780
and this comes with an emotional backlash,

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:42.025
because in the face of high-speed change,

00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:44.116
many people wish to slow down,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.708
and when there's too much unfamiliarity,

00:11:46.732 --> 00:11:49.169
people long for the familiar.

00:11:49.193 --> 00:11:51.439
And when things get too confusing,

00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:54.503
many people crave simplicity.

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:56.964
This is a very dangerous crossroads,

00:11:56.988 --> 00:12:02.315
because it's exactly where the demagogue
enters into the picture.

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:07.134
The demagogue understands
how collective sentiments work

00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:11.795
and how he -- it's usually a he --
can benefit from them.

00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:15.409
He tells us that we all
belong in our tribes,

00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:20.542
and he tells us that we will be safer
if we are surrounded by sameness.

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.925
Demagogues come in all sizes
and in all shapes.

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:28.260
This could be the eccentric leader
of a marginal political party

00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:29.620
somewhere in Europe,

00:12:29.644 --> 00:12:35.366
or an Islamist extremist imam
preaching dogma and hatred,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:41.090
or it could be a white supremacist
Nazi-admiring orator somewhere else.

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:45.266
All these figures, at first glance --
they seem disconnected.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.690
But I think they feed each other,

00:12:47.714 --> 00:12:49.757
and they need each other.

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:51.723
And all around the world,

00:12:51.747 --> 00:12:57.512
when we look at how demagogues talk
and how they inspire movements,

00:12:57.536 --> 00:13:01.866
I think they have one
unmistakable quality in common:

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.376
they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.142
They cannot deal with multiplicity.

00:13:09.668 --> 00:13:11.266
Adorno used to say,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:17.402
"Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign
of an authoritarian personality."

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:19.867
But I ask myself:

00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:21.854
What if that same sign,

00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:25.031
that same intolerance of ambiguity --

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:30.427
what if it's the mark of our times,
of the age we're living in?

00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:34.315
Because wherever I look,
I see nuances withering away.

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:38.373
On TV shows, we have
one anti-something speaker

00:13:38.397 --> 00:13:41.617
situated against a pro-something speaker.

00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.125
Yeah? It's good ratings.

00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:45.897
It's even better
if they shout at each other.

00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:50.472
Even in academia, where our intellect
is supposed to be nourished,

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:56.771
you see one atheist scholar
competing with a firmly theist scholar,

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:59.759
but it's not a real intellectual exchange,

00:13:59.783 --> 00:14:03.223
because it's a clash
between two certainties.

00:14:04.003 --> 00:14:08.515
I think binary oppositions are everywhere.

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:11.060
So slowly and systematically,

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:15.646
we are being denied the right
to be complex.

00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:19.908
Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels,

00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:22.578
Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona:

00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:26.481
we have seen one horrible
terror attack after another.

00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:30.897
And when you express your sorrow,
and when you react against the cruelty,

00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:32.763
you get all kinds of reactions,

00:14:32.787 --> 00:14:34.842
messages on social media.

00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:36.702
But one of them is quite disturbing,

00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:38.924
only because it's so widespread.

00:14:38.948 --> 00:14:42.474
They say, "Why do you feel sorry for them?

00:14:43.392 --> 00:14:45.572
Why do you feel sorry for them?

00:14:45.596 --> 00:14:48.538
Why don't you feel sorry
for civilians in Yemen

00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:50.650
or civilians in Syria?"

00:14:51.793 --> 00:14:54.193
And I think the people
who write such messages

00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:55.673
do not understand

00:14:55.697 --> 00:15:00.744
that we can feel sorry for
and stand in solidarity with

00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:05.389
victims of terrorism and violence
in the Middle East, in Europe,

00:15:05.413 --> 00:15:08.349
in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere,

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:10.524
equally and simultaneously.

00:15:11.004 --> 00:15:14.738
They don't seem to understand
that we don't have to pick one pain

00:15:14.762 --> 00:15:18.415
and one place over all others.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.443
But I think this is what
tribalism does to us.

00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:24.776
It shrinks our minds, for sure,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.922
but it also shrinks our hearts,

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:32.748
to such an extent that we become numb
to the suffering of other people.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.484
And the sad truth is,
we weren't always like this.

00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:40.520
I had a children's book out in Turkey,

00:15:40.544 --> 00:15:43.519
and when the book was published,
I did lots of events.

00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:45.153
I went to many primary schools,

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:49.069
which gave me a chance to observe
younger kids in Turkey.

00:15:49.093 --> 00:15:53.935
And it was always amazing to see
how much empathy, imagination

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:55.399
and chutzpah they have.

00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:59.450
These children are much more inclined
to become global citizens

00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:01.980
than nationalists at that age.

00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:04.101
And it's wonderful to see,
when you ask them,

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:07.216
so many of them want
to be poets and writers,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.638
and girls are just as confident as boys,

00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:12.048
if not even more.

00:16:12.626 --> 00:16:14.805
But then I would go to high schools,

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:16.644
and everything has changed.

00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:18.834
Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore,

00:16:18.858 --> 00:16:21.294
now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore,

00:16:21.318 --> 00:16:24.072
and girls have become timid,

00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:26.230
they are cautious, guarded,

00:16:26.254 --> 00:16:29.494
reluctant to speak up in the public space,

00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:31.194
because we have taught them --

00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:33.667
the family, the school, the society --

00:16:33.691 --> 00:16:37.178
we have taught them
to erase their individuality.

00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:39.187
I think East and West,

00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:41.767
we are losing multiplicity,

00:16:41.791 --> 00:16:46.328
both within our societies
and within ourselves.

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:50.563
And coming from Turkey,
I do know that the loss of diversity

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:53.074
is a major, major loss.

00:16:53.098 --> 00:16:56.425
Today, my motherland became
the world's biggest jailer

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:57.789
for journalists,

00:16:57.813 --> 00:17:01.602
surpassing even China's sad record.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.504
And I also believe that what happened
over there in Turkey

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.981
can happen anywhere.

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:11.443
It can even happen here.

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:15.693
So just like solid countries
was an illusion,

00:17:15.717 --> 00:17:20.028
singular identities is also an illusion,

00:17:20.052 --> 00:17:25.296
because we all have
a multiplicity of voices inside.

00:17:25.865 --> 00:17:29.206
The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.614
used to say, "You carry in your soul
every ingredient necessary

00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:37.519
to turn your existence into joy.

00:17:37.543 --> 00:17:40.798
All you have to do
is to mix those ingredients."

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:43.286
And I think mix we can.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.422
I am an Istanbulite,

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.609
but I'm also attached to the Balkans,

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:51.033
the Aegean, the Mediterranean,

00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:53.357
the Middle East, the Levant.

00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:56.152
I am a European by birth, by choice,

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.416
the values that I uphold.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.013
I have become a Londoner over the years.

00:18:01.037 --> 00:18:05.777
I would like to think of myself
as a global soul, as a world citizen,

00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:09.796
a nomad and an itinerant storyteller.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.577
I have multiple attachments,
just like all of us do.

00:18:13.601 --> 00:18:17.591
And multiple attachments
mean multiple stories.

00:18:18.448 --> 00:18:23.157
As writers, we always
chase stories, of course,

00:18:23.181 --> 00:18:26.275
but I think we are also
interested in silences,

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:28.358
the things we cannot talk about,

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:31.355
political taboos, cultural taboos.

00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:34.626
We're also interested in our own silences.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.471
I have always been very vocal
about and written extensively

00:18:39.495 --> 00:18:42.540
about minority rights, women's rights,

00:18:42.564 --> 00:18:44.169
LGBT rights.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.689
But as I was thinking about this TED Talk,

00:18:47.713 --> 00:18:49.276
I realized one thing:

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.210
I have never had the courage
to say in a public space

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:57.437
that I was bisexual myself,

00:18:57.461 --> 00:19:00.588
because I so feared the slander

00:19:00.612 --> 00:19:03.120
and the stigma and the ridicule

00:19:03.144 --> 00:19:06.025
and the hatred that was sure to follow.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.162
But of course, one should never,
ever, remain silent

00:19:11.186 --> 00:19:13.452
for fear of complexity.

00:19:14.482 --> 00:19:19.445
(Applause)

00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:25.626
And although I am
no stranger to anxieties,

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.396
and although I am talking here
about the power of emotions --

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.472
I do know the power of emotions --

00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:33.423
I have discovered over time

00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:35.597
that emotions are not limitless.

00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:37.375
You know? They have a limit.

00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:38.674
There comes a moment --

00:19:38.698 --> 00:19:40.821
it's like a tipping point
or a threshold --

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:43.968
when you get tired of feeling afraid,

00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:46.664
when you get tired of feeling anxious.

00:19:46.688 --> 00:19:48.583
And I think not only individuals,

00:19:48.607 --> 00:19:53.158
but perhaps nations, too,
have their own tipping points.

00:19:53.685 --> 00:19:56.413
So even stronger than my emotions

00:19:56.437 --> 00:19:58.338
is my awareness

00:19:58.362 --> 00:20:02.011
that not only gender, not only identity,

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.876
but life itself is fluid.

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:08.185
They want to divide us into tribes,

00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:11.187
but we are connected across borders.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.889
They preach certainty,

00:20:12.913 --> 00:20:16.514
but we know that life has plenty of magic

00:20:16.538 --> 00:20:18.584
and plenty of ambiguity.

00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:21.399
And they like to incite dualities,

00:20:21.423 --> 00:20:24.851
but we are far more nuanced than that.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.899
So what can we do?

00:20:26.923 --> 00:20:29.241
I think we need to go back to the basics,

00:20:29.265 --> 00:20:32.013
back to the colors of the alphabet.

00:20:32.037 --> 00:20:35.797
The Lebanese poet
Khalil Gibran used to say,

00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:38.614
"I learned silence from the talkative

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:41.078
and tolerance from the intolerant

00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:43.948
and kindness from the unkind."

00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:46.573
I think it's a great motto for our times.

00:20:47.094 --> 00:20:50.555
So from populist demagogues, we will learn

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:53.295
the indispensability of democracy.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:58.053
And from isolationists, we will learn
the need for global solidarity.

00:20:58.077 --> 00:21:03.558
And from tribalists, we will learn
the beauty of cosmopolitanism

00:21:03.582 --> 00:21:06.414
and the beauty of diversity.

00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:12.457
As I finish, I want to leave you
with one word, or one taste.

00:21:12.481 --> 00:21:16.166
The word "yurt" in Turkish
means "motherland."

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.861
It means "homeland."

00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:20.164
But interestingly, the word also means

00:21:20.188 --> 00:21:23.457
"a tent used by nomadic tribes."

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:27.024
And I like that combination,
because it makes me think

00:21:27.048 --> 00:21:31.124
homelands do not need
to be rooted in one place.

00:21:31.148 --> 00:21:32.612
They can be portable.

00:21:32.636 --> 00:21:35.345
We can take them with us everywhere.

00:21:35.369 --> 00:21:38.292
And I think for writers, for storytellers,

00:21:38.316 --> 00:21:39.728
at the end of the day,

00:21:39.752 --> 00:21:42.177
there is one main homeland,

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:44.523
and it's called "Storyland."

00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:47.263
And the taste of that word

00:21:47.287 --> 00:21:49.591
is the taste of freedom.

00:21:49.615 --> 00:21:50.918
Thank you.

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:56.975
(Applause)
