00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:15.953
Hi. So today, I'd like to share
some works in progress.

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:18.170
Since we are still realizing these works,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.921
we are largely working within the realm

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.026
of intuition and mystery, still.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:23.789
So I'm going to try and describe

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.916
some of the experiences that we're looking for

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:27.639
through each of the works.

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:30.945
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.940
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.332
and catches a glimpse of these panels

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:38.507
in a messy composition on the wall.

00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:41.059
Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.684
the presence of the viewer,

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:45.728
they appear to panic and sort of get into

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:47.242
a strict symmetry.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:48.985
(Laughter)

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.133
So this is the sketch of the two states.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.791
One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.142
And we were interested in seeing how little change

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:59.798
it takes to move from one state to the other state.

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:03.528
This also reminded us of two
very different pictorial traditions.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.081
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.315
and the other is about 100 years ago,

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.271
Malevich's abstract compositions.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.287
So I'm just going to take you to a video.

00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:14.660
To give you a sense of scale,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.875
the largest panel is about two meters high.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.693
That's about this much. 
And the smallest one is an A4.

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:21.905
So a viewer enters the space,

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.001
and they snap to attention.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.989
And after a while, if the viewer continues

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:27.717
to remain in the space,

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.705
the panels will sort of become immune

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:31.418
to the presence of the viewer

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:34.453
and become lax and autonomous again,

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:37.828
until they sort of sense a presence
in the room or a movement,

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:40.527
when they will again snap to attention.

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:42.006
(Laughter)

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.405
So here it appears as if it's the viewer

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.650
that's sort of instigating the sense
of order among the panels,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.675
but it could also be the other way around,

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.019
that the panels are so stuck within

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.013
their preconditioned behaviors

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:59.541
that they sort of thrust the
viewer with the role of a tyrant.

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.039
So this brings me to a quieter, small work

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.608
called Handheld.

00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:05.342
The viewer sees a piece of paper

00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:07.812
that's mounted on the far end of the wall,

00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:10.440
but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.712
A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,

00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:14.029
that's held on either side

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.970
by two small hands

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.237
that appear to be carved with a great deal

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.710
of attention and care from a small block of wood.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.706
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:27.168
is sort of moving very slightly,

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:29.029
as if these two hands are trying

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:30.531
to hold the paper very still

00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:32.710
for a long period of time,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.645
and somehow are not managing to.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.618
So this instability in the movement

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:41.136
very closely resembles the unsteady nature

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:43.698
of images seen through a handheld camera.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:46.386
So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.

00:02:46.386 --> 00:02:47.806
One is through a still camera

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.884
and the other is through a handheld camera.

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:52.485
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:55.529
of the video suggests the presence

00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:58.031
of an observer and a subjective point of view.

00:02:58.031 --> 00:02:59.860
So we've just removed the camera

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.141
and transferred that movement onto the panel.

00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.658
So here's a video.

00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:06.113
You have to imagine the other hand.
It's not there yet.

00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:08.860
But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.399
a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:13.990
with outstretched arms

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.492
behind this enormous piece of paper.

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:19.077
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:21.381
to be at the service of the observer and present

00:03:21.381 --> 00:03:24.631
this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer

00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:27.394
in front of them.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:29.554
The next work is Decoy.

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:31.342
This is a cardboard model, so the object

00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:33.246
is about as tall as I am.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.135
It has a rounded body, two arms,

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:37.346
and a very tall, head-like antenna,

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:41.243
and its sole purpose is to
attract attention towards itself.

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:43.029
So when a viewer passes by,

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.844
it sort of tilts from side to side,

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.017
and moves its arms more and more frantically

00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:51.384
as the person gets closer.

00:03:51.384 --> 00:03:53.908
So here is the first test scenario.

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:55.797
You see the two movements integrated,

00:03:55.797 --> 00:03:57.786
and the object seems to be employing

00:03:57.786 --> 00:04:02.858
its entire being in this expression of desperation.

00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:05.522
But the idea is that once it's
got the person's attention,

00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:09.594
it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:12.708
(Laughter)

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.740
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.857
It appears to be mass-manufactured

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.559
like it came out of a factory

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.836
like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:23.339
Because we are always working

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.747
from a very personal space,

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:27.174
we like how this consumer aesthetic

00:04:27.174 --> 00:04:29.246
sort of depersonalizes the object

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.977
and gives us a bit of distance

00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:32.897
in its appearance, at least.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.237
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being

00:04:35.237 --> 00:04:37.356
which is trying to distract you from the things

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:38.951
that actually need your attention,

00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:43.701
but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:45.897
The next work is an object,

00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:48.321
that's also a kind of sound instrument.

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.108
In the shape of an amphitheater

00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:52.048
that's scaled to the size of an audience

00:04:52.048 --> 00:04:54.114
as perceived from somebody from the stage.

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:55.728
So from where I'm standing,

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.390
each of you appears to be this big,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.443
and the audience sort of takes the entire

00:04:59.443 --> 00:05:01.456
field of my vision.

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:05.418
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.

00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:07.604
They're mechanically enabled to clap

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:09.374
of their own free will.

00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:11.407
This means that each of them can decide

00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:12.987
if and when they want to clap,

00:05:12.987 --> 00:05:14.619
how hard, for how long,

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:18.306
how they want to be influenced by
those around them or influence others,

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:22.286
and if they want to contribute to innovation.

00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:24.803
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,

00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:26.487
there will be a response.

00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:29.085
It could be a few claps or a strong applause,

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:31.269
and then nothing happens until the viewer

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.345
leaves the stage, and again
the audience will respond.

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.670
It could be anything from a few feeble claps

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.352
from members in the audience,

00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:42.680
or it could be a very loud ovation.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.642
So to us, I think we're really looking

00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:46.939
at an audience as its own object

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.655
or its own organism

00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:52.405
that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:53.785
an instrument.

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:55.541
So the viewer can play it

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.977
by eliciting quite complex and varied,

00:05:57.977 --> 00:06:00.673
nuanced musical or sound patterns,

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:02.949
but cannot really provoke the audience

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.337
into any particular kind of response.

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:08.081
So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness

00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:10.322
and uneasiness involved.

00:06:10.322 --> 00:06:14.431
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.

00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:16.551
So here if you see we're quite excited about

00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:20.373
the image of the head splitting
to form the two hands.

00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:22.284
So here's a small visual animation,

00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:26.616
as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:28.643
against each other to kind of make sense

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:31.178
of the duality and the tension.

00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:33.746
And here is a prototype.

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:38.548
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.

00:06:38.548 --> 00:06:41.551
Okay, this is the last work.
It's called the Framerunners.

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.070
It comes out of the idea of a window.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.381
This is an actual window in our studio,

00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:48.299
and as you can see, it's made up of three

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:50.581
different thicknesses of wooden sections.

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.854
So we used the same window vocabulary

00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:55.681
to construct our own frame or grid

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.623
that's suspended in the room and that can

00:06:57.623 --> 00:06:59.436
be viewed from two sides.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:02.410
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.975
They're also made up of three different sizes,

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:07.401
as if to suggest a kind of perspective

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.112
or landscape on the single plain.

00:07:10.112 --> 00:07:12.557
Each of these figures can also run backward

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.122
and forward in the track

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:17.679
and hide behind two adjacent tracks.

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:19.789
So in contrast to this very tight grid,

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.210
we wanted to give these figures a very comical

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.299
and slapstick-like quality,

00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:26.138
as if a puppeteer has taken them

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:28.879
and physically animated them down the path.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.159
So we like the idea of these figures

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.695
sort of skipping along

00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:34.783
like they're oblivious and carefree

00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:37.331
and happy-go-lucky and content,

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.531
until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer

00:07:40.531 --> 00:07:44.799
and they will hide behind the fastest wall.

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:48.633
So to us, this work also presents
its own contradiction.

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:50.457
These figures are sort of entrapped

00:07:50.457 --> 00:07:52.604
within this very strong grid,

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:55.360
which is like a prison, but also a fortress,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.294
because it allows them to be oblivious

00:07:57.294 --> 00:07:59.999
and naive and carefree and quite oblivious

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:02.568
of the external world.

00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:05.373
So all these real life qualities that I talk about

00:08:05.373 --> 00:08:07.655
are sort of translated to a very specific

00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:09.416
technical configuration,

00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:11.459
and we were very lucky to collaborate

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:14.627
with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.892
So you see they extracted the motion cogs

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:18.982
from our animations and created a wiggle

00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:20.936
that integrated the head-bobbing movement

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:22.704
and the back-and-forth movement.

00:08:22.704 --> 00:08:24.226
So it's really quite small.

00:08:24.226 --> 00:08:26.518
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.

00:08:26.518 --> 00:08:28.329
So imagine our excitement when we saw it

00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:31.494
really working in the studio, and here it is.
