00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.675
As patients,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.316
we usually remember
the names of our doctors,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.660
but often we forget
the names of our nurses.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.620
I remember one.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.436
I had breast cancer a few years ago,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.916
and somehow I managed
to get through the surgeries

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.220
and the beginning
of the treatment just fine.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.916
I could hide what was going on.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.156
Everybody didn't really have to know.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.396
I could walk my daughter to school,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.396
I could go out to dinner with my husband;

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.620
I could fool people.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.876
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.636
and that terrified me

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.196
because I knew that I was going to lose
every single hair on my body

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.780
because of the kind of chemo
that I was going to have.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.596
I wasn't going to be able
to pretend anymore

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.420
as though everything was normal.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.556
I was scared.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.156
I knew what it felt like to have
everybody treating me with kid gloves,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.556
and I just wanted to feel normal.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.756
I had a port installed in my chest.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.556
I went to my first day of chemotherapy,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.916
and I was an emotional wreck.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.955
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.956
and every bone in my body was telling
me to get up out of that chair

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.476
and take for the hills.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.260
But Joanne looked at me and talked
to me like we were old friends.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.476
And then she asked me,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.596
"Where'd you get your highlights done?"

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.716
(Laughter)

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.676
And I was like, are you kidding me?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.556
You're going to talk to me about my hair
when I'm on the verge of losing it?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.316
I was kind of angry,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.900
and I said, "Really? Hair?"

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.796
And with a shrug
of her shoulders she said,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.180
"It's gonna grow back."

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.356
And in that moment she said
the one thing I had overlooked,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.196
and that was that at some point,
my life would get back to normal.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.916
She really believed that.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.620
And so I believed it, too.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.116
Now, worrying about losing your hair
when you're fighting cancer

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.756
may seem silly at first,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.916
but it's not just that you're worried
about how you're going to look.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.860
It's that you're worried that everybody's
going to treat you so carefully.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.116
Joanne made me feel normal
for the first time in six months.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.995
We talked about her boyfriends,

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.756
we talked about looking
for apartments in New York City,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.636
and we talked about my reaction
to the chemotherapy --

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.620
all kind of mixed in together.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.156
And I always wondered,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.820
how did she so instinctively
know just how to talk to me?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.716
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.540
marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.596
A few years later,
I was asked to do a project

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.300
that would celebrate
the work that nurses do.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.436
I started with Joanne,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.460
and I met over 100 nurses
across the country.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.196
I spent five years interviewing,
photographing and filming nurses

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.380
for a book and a documentary film.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.596
With my team,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.956
we mapped a trip across America
that would take us to places

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.916
dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation --

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.020
aging, war, poverty, prisons.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.916
And then we went places

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.796
where we would find
the largest concentration of patients

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.340
dealing with those issues.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.156
Then we asked hospitals and facilities
to nominate nurses

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.700
who would best represent them.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.460
One of the first nurses I met
was Bridget Kumbella.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.636
Bridget was born in Cameroon,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.500
the oldest of four children.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.076
Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.076
and really hurt his back.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.236
And he talked a lot about what it was like
to be flat on your back

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.700
and not get the kind
of care that you need.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.980
And that propelled Bridget
to go into the profession of nursing.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.436
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.876
she has a really diverse group
of patients that she cares for,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.796
from all walks of life,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.780
and from all different religions.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.396
And she's devoted her career
to understanding the impact

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.020
of our cultural differences
when it comes to our health.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.436
She spoke of a patient --

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.156
a Native American patient that she had --

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.900
that wanted to bring
a bunch of feathers into the ICU.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.916
That's how he found spiritual comfort.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.156
And she spoke of advocating for him

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.956
and said that patients come
from all different religions

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.876
and use all different kinds
of objects for comfort;

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.156
whether it's a holy rosary
or a symbolic feather,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.940
it all needs to be supported.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.836
This is Jason Short.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.916
Jason is a home health nurse
in the Appalachian mountains,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.316
and his dad had a gas station
and a repair shop when he was growing up.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.660
So he worked on cars in the community
that he now serves as a nurse.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.676
When he was in college,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.356
it was just not macho at all
to become a nurse,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.556
so he avoided it for years.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.516
He drove trucks for a little while,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.020
but his life path was always
pulling him back to nursing.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.036
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.876
Jason goes places
that an ambulance can't even get to.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.340
In this photograph,
he's standing in what used to be a road.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.716
Top of the mountain mining
flooded that road,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.036
and now the only way
for Jason to get to the patient

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.956
living in that house
with black lung disease

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.300
is to drive his SUV
against the current up that creek.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.260
The day I was with him,
we ripped the front fender off the car.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.196
The next morning he got up,
put the car on the lift,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.476
fixed the fender,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.596
and then headed out
to meet his next patient.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.756
I witnessed Jason
caring for this gentleman

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.596
with such enormous compassion,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.620
and I was struck again by how intimate
the work of nursing really is.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.956
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.596
He had just come back from a deployment

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.196
and he hadn't really settled back in
to life in San Diego yet.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.756
He talked about his experience
of being a nurse in Germany

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.756
and taking care of the soldiers
coming right off the battlefield.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.556
Very often, he would be
the first person they would see

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.660
when they opened
their eyes in the hospital.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.876
And they would look at him
as they were lying there,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.556
missing limbs,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.196
and the first thing they would say is,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.940
"When can I go back?
I left my brothers out there."

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.436
And Brian would have to say,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.036
"You're not going anywhere.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.900
You've already given enough, brother."

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.580
Brian is both a nurse and a soldier
who's seen combat.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.156
So that puts him in a unique position

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.540
to be able to relate to and help heal
the veterans in his care.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.876
This is Sister Stephen,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.116
and she runs a nursing home
in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.596
And the entire circle of life
can be found under her roof.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.076
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.796
so given the opportunity
to adopt local farm animals,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.876
she enthusiastically brings them in.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.436
And in the springtime,
those animals have babies.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.636
And Sister Stephen uses
those baby ducks, goats and lambs

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.916
as animal therapy
for the residents at Villa Loretto

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.276
who sometimes can't
remember their own name,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.860
but they do rejoice
in the holding of a baby lamb.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.036
The day I was with Sister Stephen,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.156
I needed to take her away
from Villa Loretto

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.276
to film part of her story.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.556
And before we left,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.060
she went into the room of a dying patient.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.596
And she leaned over and she said,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.540
"I have to go away for the day,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.036
but if Jesus calls you,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.276
you go.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.460
You go straight home to Jesus."

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.676
I was standing there and thinking

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.716
it was the first time in my life

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.036
I witnessed that you could show
someone you love them completely

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.260
by letting go.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.180
We don't have to hold on so tightly.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.796
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.860
than I have ever seen at any other time
at any other place in my life.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.196
We live in a complicated time
when it comes to our health care.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.396
It's easy to lose sight
of the need for quality of life,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.140
not just quantity of life.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.356
As new life-saving
technologies are created,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.380
we're going to have really
complicated decisions to make.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.956
These technologies often save lives,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.900
but they can also prolong pain
and the dying process.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.636
How in the world are we supposed
to navigate these waters?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.708
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.156
Nurses have a really unique
relationship with us

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.660
because of the time spent at bedside.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.796
During that time,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.340
a kind of emotional intimacy develops.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.036
This past summer, on August 9,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.980
my father died of a heart attack.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.076
My mother was devastated,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.060
and she couldn't imagine
her world without him in it.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.116
Four days later she fell,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.996
she broke her hip,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.516
she needed surgery

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.460
and she found herself
fighting for her own life.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.436
Once again I found myself

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.436
on the receiving end
of the care of nurses --

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.900
this time for my mom.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.556
My brother and my sister and I
stayed by her side

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.020
for the next three days in the ICU.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.916
And as we tried
to make the right decisions

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.316
and follow my mother's wishes,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.260
we found that we were depending
upon the guidance of nurses.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.476
And once again,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.020
they didn't let us down.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.196
They had an amazing insight
in terms of how to care for my mom

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.476
in the last four days of her life.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.660
They brought her comfort
and relief from pain.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.396
They knew to encourage my sister and I
to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.316
long after it mattered to her,

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.140
but it sure meant a lot to us.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.580
And they knew to come and wake me up
just in time for my mom's last breath.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.836
And then they knew
how long to leave me in the room

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.540
with my mother after she died.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.516
I have no idea how they know these things,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.676
but I do know that I am eternally grateful

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.500
that they've guided me once again.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.236
Thank you so very much.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.257
(Applause)
