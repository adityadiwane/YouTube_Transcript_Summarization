00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.940
Today, more than half
of the world's population lives in cities.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.676
The urbanization process
started in the late 1700s

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.996
and has been increasing since then.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.076
The prediction is that by 2050,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.116
66 percent of the population
will live in cities

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.676
and the United Nations,
the World Health Organization,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.156
the World Economic Forum, are warning us,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.876
if we don't plan
for the increased density,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.996
current problems in our cities,
like inequality, congestion, crime

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.396
can only get worse.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.036
As a result, urban planners
and city developers

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.596
are putting a lot of effort and creativity

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.500
in designing our future,
denser, bigger cities.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.396
But I have a different opinion.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.436
I think urbanization is actually
reaching the end of its cycle,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.780
and now people are going to start
moving back to the countryside.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.636
And you may think,
"But what about the trend?"

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.636
Well, let me tell you,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.100
socioeconomic trends don't last forever.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:17.756
You know, 12,000 years ago

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.796
everybody was perfectly happy

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.836
roaming the land, hunting and gathering.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.516
And then, the trend changes,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.996
and the new thing
is to live in a farm and have cattle,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.836
until it changes again.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.420
When we get to the industrial revolution.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.916
Actually, that is what started
the urbanization process.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.420
And you know what triggered it?

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.740
Steam power, machines,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.436
new chemical processes --

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.660
in two words, technological innovation.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.420
And I believe technology
can also bring the end of this cycle.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.276
I've been working on innovation
for most of my career.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.436
I love it. I love my job.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.556
It allows me to work with drones,
with 3D printers and smart glasses,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.636
and not just those you can buy in the shop
but also prototypes.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.940
It's a lot of fun sometimes.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.676
Now, some of these technologies

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.796
are opening new possibilities
that will radically change

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.596
the way we did things before

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.596
and in a few years,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.516
they may allow us
to enjoy the benefits of city life

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.196
from anywhere.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.436
Think about it.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.236
If you could live in a place
with a lower crime rate

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.596
and more space

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.356
and a lower cost of living

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.780
and less traffic,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.756
of course many people would want that,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.476
but they feel they don't have a choice.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.260
You have to live in the city.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.596
Well, in the past,
people moved to the cities

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.196
not because they loved the city itself

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.876
but for the things
you could have in a city,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.716
more job opportunities,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.796
easier access to services and goods

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.020
and a rich social life.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860
So let's dive deeper.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100
More jobs and career opportunities.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.276
Is that still true today,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.476
because the office people
are starting to realize

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.476
that working in the office
and being in the office

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140
may not be the same thing anymore.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.236
According to a study
by Global Workplace Analytics,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.460
more than 80 percent of the US workforce
would like to work from home.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.140
And do you know how much it costs
for a company to even have an office?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.740
11,000 dollars per employee per year.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.396
If only half of those workers

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.780
would telework
even 50 percent of the time,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.676
the savings in the states
would exceed 500 billion dollars,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.476
and it could reduce greenhouse gases
by 54 million tons.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.756
That is the equivalent

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.860
of 10 million cars
off the streets for a whole year.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.396
But even though most people
would want to telework,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.956
current technology
makes the experience isolating.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.236
It's not comfortable.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.060
It doesn't feel like being there.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.196
But that is going to change

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.516
by the convergence of two technologies:

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.540
augmented reality and telepresence robots.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.396
Augmented reality already today

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.956
allows you to take your office
environment everywhere with you.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.476
All you need is a wearable computer,
a pair of smart glasses,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.876
and you can take your emails
and your spreadsheets

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.140
with you wherever you go.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.676
And video conferences and video calls
have become very common these days,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.116
but they still need improvement.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.060
I mean, all those little faces
on a flat screen,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.396
sometimes you don't
even know who is talking.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.236
Now, we already have something
way better than static videocalls:

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.916
your average telepresence robot.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.340
I call it tablet on a stick.

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.076
(Laughter)

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.836
You can control, you can move around,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.036
you can control what you're looking at.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.340
It's way better, but far from perfect.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.196
You know how they say

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.260
that most human
communication is nonverbal?

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.556
Well, the robot doesn't
give you any of that.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.940
It looks like an alien.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.020
But with advances in augmented reality,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.316
it will be easy to wrap the robot
in a nice hologram

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.620
that actually looks
and moves like a person.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.540
That will do it.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.236
Or else, forget the robot.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.236
We go full VR,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.580
and everybody meets in cyberspace.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.716
Give it a couple of years
and that will feel so real,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.460
you won't tell the difference.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.660
So what was the next reason
why people move to cities?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.300
Access to services and goods.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.740
But today you can do all that online.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.060
According to a study made by comScore,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.596
online shoppers in the US last year

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.100
did more than half
of their retail purchases online,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.356
and the global market for e-commerce

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.356
is estimated to be
at two trillion dollars.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.596
And it's expected to reach 2.38
by the end of 2017,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.020
according to eMarketer.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.140
Now, from a logistics standpoint,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.900
density is good for deliveries.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.020
Supplying goods
to a shopping mall is easy.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.316
You can send big shipments to the shop,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.476
and people will go there, pick it up
and take it home themselves.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.156
E-commerce means we need to ship onesies

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.956
and have them home delivered.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.236
That's more expensive.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.956
It's like the difference between
having a birthday party for 20 people

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.076
or bringing a piece of the cake

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.740
to each of your 20 friends at their place.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.196
But at least in the city,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.676
they live close to each other.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.940
Density helps.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.260
Now, e-commerce deliveries
in the countryside,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.620
those take forever.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.956
The truck sometimes needs to drive miles
between one address and the next one.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.700
Those are the most expensive
deliveries of all.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.436
But we already have a solution for that:

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.876
drones.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.276
A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.156
The driver does some of the deliveries

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.516
while the drones are flying
back and forth from the truck as it moves.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.076
That way, the average cost
for delivery is reduced,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.580
and voila:

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.820
affordable e-commerce services
in the countryside.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.996
You will see:

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.756
the new homes of our teleworkers

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.180
will probably have
a drone pod in the yard.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.036
So once the final mile delivery
is not a problem,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.660
you don't need to be in the city
to buy things anymore.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.116
So that's two.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.820
Now, what was the third reason
why people move to cities?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.580
A rich social life.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.156
They would need to be
in the city for that these days.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.236
Because people these days,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.636
they make friends,
they chat, gossip and flirt

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.476
from the comfort of their sofa.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.836
(Laughter)

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.276
And while wearing their favorite pajamas.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.596
(Laughter)

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.740
There are over two billion
active social media users in the world.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.676
In a way, that makes you think
like we are connected

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.916
no matter where we are.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.236
But OK, not completely.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.700
Sometimes you still need
some real human contact.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.596
Ironically, the city,
with its population density,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.620
is not always the best for that.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.596
Actually, as social groups become smaller,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.236
they grow stronger.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.476
A recent study made in the UK

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.636
by the Office for National Statistics

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.516
showed a higher life satisfaction rating

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.260
among people living in rural areas.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.116
So as people settle in the countryside,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.116
well, they will buy local groceries,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.955
fresh groceries, foodstuff,

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:51.180
maintenance services.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.340
So handymen, small workshops,
service companies will thrive.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.276
Maybe some of the industrial
workers from the cities

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.620
displaced by the automation

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.916
will find a nice alternative job here,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.140
and they will move too.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.556
And as people move to the countryside,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.236
how is that going to be?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.036
Think about autonomous,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.116
off-the-grid houses with solar panels,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.860
with wind turbines
and waste recycling utilities,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.916
our new homes producing their own energy
and using it to also power the family car.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.036
I mean, cities have always been regarded
as being more energy-efficient,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.316
but let me tell you,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.820
repopulating the countryside
can be eco too.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.220
By now, you're probably thinking
of all the advantages of country living.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.076
(Laughter)

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.356
I did it myself.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.916
Six years ago, my wife and I,
we packed our stuff,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.876
we sold our little apartment in Spain,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.996
and for the same money
we bought a house with a garden

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.596
and little birds that come
singing in the morning.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.076
(Laughter)

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.676
It's so nice there.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.676
And we live in a small village,
not really the countryside yet.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.876
That is going to be my next move:

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.116
a refurbished farmhouse,

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.340
not too far from a city, not too close.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.236
And now we'll make sure
to have a good spot for drones to land.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.436
(Laughter)

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.196
But hey, that's me.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.476
It doesn't have to be you,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.236
because it would seem
like I'm trying to convince somebody

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.756
to come join us in the country.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.996
I'm not.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.396
(Laughter)

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.076
I don't need more people to come.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.916
(Laughter)

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.716
I just think they will

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.100
once they realize they can have
the same benefits the city has.

00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:37.516
But if you don't like the country,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.000
I have good news for you, too.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.620
Cities will not disappear.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.716
But as people move out,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.660
a lower density will help them
recover a better flow and balance.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.700
Anyway, I guess now
you have some thinking to do.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.076
Do you still think
you need to live in the city?

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.700
And more importantly,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.540
do you want to?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.836
Thank you very much.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.860
(Applause)
