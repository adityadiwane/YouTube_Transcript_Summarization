00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.456
I'm here to recruit men
to support gender equality.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.616
(Cheers)

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.280
Wait, wait. What?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.496
What do men have to do
with gender equality?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.496
Gender equality is about women, right?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.040
I mean, the word gender is about women.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.496
Actually, I'm even here speaking
as a middle class white man.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.416
Now, I wasn't always
a middle class white man.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.840
It all happened for me about 30 years ago
when I was in graduate school,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.056
and a bunch of us graduate students
got together one day,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.736
and we said, you know,
there's an explosion

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.496
of writing and thinking
in feminist theory,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.416
but there's no courses yet.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.774
So we did what graduate students
typically do in a situation like that.

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:02.456
We said, OK, let's have a study group.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.056
We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.656
we'll have a potluck dinner.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.176
(Laughter)

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.696
So every week,
11 women and me got together.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.496
(Laughter)

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.456
We would read some text in feminist theory
and have a conversation about it.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.696
And during one of our conversations,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.840
I witnessed an interaction
that changed my life forever.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.720
It was a conversation between two women.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.896
One of the women was white,
and one was black.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.256
And the white woman said --

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.616
this is going to sound
very anachronistic now --

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.336
the white woman said, "All women
face the same oppression as women.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.176
All women are similarly
situated in patriarchy,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.816
and therefore all women have a kind
of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood."

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.480
And the black woman said,
"I'm not so sure.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.296
Let me ask you a question."

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.056
So the black woman
says to the white woman,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.936
"When you wake up in the morning
and you look in the mirror,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.176
what do you see?"

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
And the white woman said, "I see a woman."

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.016
And the black woman said,
"You see, that's the problem for me.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.536
Because when I wake up in the morning
and I look in the mirror," she said,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.936
"I see a black woman.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.040
To me, race is visible. But to you,
race is invisible. You don't see it."

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.455
And then she said
something really startling.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.320
She said, "That's how privilege works.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.920
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it."

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.936
It is a luxury, I will say
to the white people sitting in this room,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.696
not to have to think about race
every split second of our lives.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.560
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.671
Now remember, I was
the only man in this group,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.776
so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.536
(Laughter)

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.896
And somebody said,
"Well what was that reaction?"

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.576
And I said, "Well, when I wake up
in the morning and I look in the mirror,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.496
I see a human being.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.976
I'm kind of the generic person.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.016
You know, I'm a middle class white man.
I have no race, no class, no gender.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.056
I'm universally generalizable."

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.896
(Laughter)

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.656
So I like to think that was the moment
I became a middle class white man,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.616
that class and race and gender
were not about other people,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.176
they were about me.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.376
I had to start thinking about them,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.400
and it had been privilege that had
kept it invisible to me for so long.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.867
Now, I wish I could tell you
this story ends 30 years ago

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.456
in that little discussion group,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.256
but I was reminded of it quite recently
at my university where I teach.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.216
I have a colleague, and she and I
both teach the sociology of gender course

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.096
on alternate semesters.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.496
So she gives a guest lecture
for me when I teach.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.896
I give a guest lecture
for her when she teaches.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.256
So I walk into her class
to give a guest lecture,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.456
about 300 students in the room,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.816
and as I walk in, one of the students
looks up and says,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.200
"Oh, finally, an objective opinion."

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.976
All that semester, whenever
my colleague opened her mouth,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.376
what my students saw was a woman.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.496
I mean, if you were to say to my students,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.976
"There is structural inequality
based on gender in the United States,"

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.016
they'd say, "Well of course
you'd say that.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.517
You're a woman. You're biased."

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.416
When I say it, they go,
"Wow, is that interesting.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.440
Is that going to be on the test?
How do you spell 'structural'?"

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:15.296
(Laughter)

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.576
So I hope you all can see,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.456
this is what objectivity looks like.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.216
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.496
Disembodied Western rationality.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.255
(Laughter)

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.760
And that, by the way, is why I think
men so often wear ties.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.056
(Laughter)

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.656
Because if you are going to embody
disembodied Western rationality,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.176
you need a signifier,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.416
and what could be a better signifier
of disembodied Western rationality

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.856
than a garment that at one end is a noose
and the other end points to the genitals?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.640
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.520
That is mind-body dualism right there.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.176
So making gender visible to men

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.016
is the first step to engaging men
to support gender equality.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.376
Now, when men first hear
about gender equality,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.305
when they first start thinking about it,

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:19.816
they often think, many men think,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.096
well, that's right,
that's fair, that's just,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.120
that's the ethical imperative.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.696
But not all men.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.416
Some men think --
the lightning bolt goes off,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.256
and they go, "Oh my God,
yes, gender equality,"

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.000
and they will immediately begin
to mansplain to you your oppression.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.576
They see supporting gender equality
something akin to the cavalry,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.743
like, "Thanks very much for bringing this
to our attention, ladies,

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:48.967
we'll take it from here."

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.736
This results in a syndrome that I like
to call 'premature self-congratulation.'

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.056
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.176
There's another group, though,
that actively resists gender equality,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.896
that sees gender equality
as something that is detrimental to men.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.736
I was on a TV talk show
opposite four white men.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.936
This is the beginning of the book
I wrote, 'Angry White Men.'

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.656
These were four angry white men

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.536
who believed that they,
white men in America,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.040
were the victims of reverse discrimination
in the workplace.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.896
And they all told stories
about how they were qualified for jobs,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.136
qualified for promotions,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.416
they didn't get them,
they were really angry.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.616
And the reason I'm telling you this
is I want you to hear the title

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.296
of this particular show.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.456
It was a quote from one of the men,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.896
and the quote was,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.120
"A Black Woman Stole My Job."

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.936
And they all told their stories,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.096
qualified for jobs,
qualified for promotions,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.456
didn't get it, really angry.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.256
And then it was my turn to speak,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.856
and I said, "I have
just one question for you guys,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.496
and it's about the title of the show,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.376
'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.296
Actually, it's about
one word in the title.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.856
I want to know about the word 'my.'

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.560
Where did you get the idea
it was your job?

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.576
Why isn't the title of the show,
'A Black Woman Got the Job?'

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.056
or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.216
Because without confronting
men's sense of entitlement,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.536
I don't think we'll ever understand
why so many men resist gender equality.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.976
(Applause)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.336
Look, we think this
is a level playing field,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.536
so any policy that tilts it
even a little bit,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.696
we think, "Oh my God,
water's rushing uphill.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.625
It's reverse discrimination against us."

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:37.856
(Laughter)

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.280
So let me be very clear:

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.896
white men in Europe and the United States

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.936
are the beneficiaries of the single
greatest affirmative action program

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.496
in the history of the world.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.576
It is called "the history of the world."

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.280
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.976
So, now I've established
some of the obstacles to engaging men,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.616
but why should we support gender equality?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.096
Of course, it's fair,
it's right and it's just.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.576
But more than that,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.680
gender equality is also
in our interest as men.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.376
If you listen to what men say
about what they want in their lives,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.936
gender equality is actually a way
for us to get the lives we want to live.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.496
Gender equality is good for countries.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.576
It turns out, according to most studies,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.576
that those countries
that are the most gender equal

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.136
are also the countries that score highest
on the happiness scale.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.536
And that's not just because
they're all in Europe.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.776
(Laughter)

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.535
Even within Europe, those countries
that are more gender equal

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.159
also have the highest levels of happiness.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.000
It is also good for companies.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.456
Research by Catalyst and others
has shown conclusively

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.096
that the more gender-equal companies are,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.336
the better it is for workers,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.176
the happier their labor force is.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.056
They have lower job turnover.
They have lower levels of attrition.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.416
They have an easier time recruiting.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.376
They have higher rates of retention,
higher job satisfaction,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.616
higher rates of productivity.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.496
So the question I'm often asked
in companies is,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.092
"Boy, this gender equality thing,
that's really going to be expensive, huh?"

00:09:24.116 --> 00:09:28.336
And I say, "Oh no, in fact,
what you have to start calculating

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.336
is how much gender inequality
is already costing you.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.280
It is extremely expensive."

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.600
So it is good for business.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.280
And the other thing is, it's good for men.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.016
It is good for the kind of lives
we want to live,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.976
because young men especially
have changed enormously,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.176
and they want to have lives
that are animated

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.936
by terrific relationships
with their children.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.696
They expect their partners,
their spouses, their wives,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.896
to work outside the home

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.416
and be just as committed
to their careers as they are.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.256
I was talking, to give you
an illustration of this change --

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.056
Some of you may remember this.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.176
When I was a lot younger,
there was a riddle that was posed to us.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.616
Some of you may wince
to remember this riddle.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.216
This riddle went something like this.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.576
A man and his son
are driving on the freeway,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.576
and they're in a terrible accident,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.856
and the father is killed,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.936
and the son is brought
to the hospital emergency room,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.016
and as they're bringing the son
into the hospital emergency room,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.656
the emergency room attending physician
sees the boy and says,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.016
"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.400
How is this possible?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.456
We were flummoxed by this.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.656
We could not figure this out.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.616
(Laughter)

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.776
Well, I decided to do a little experiment
with my 16-year old son.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.256
He had a bunch of his friends
hanging out at the house

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.576
watching a game on TV recently.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.816
So I decided I would pose
this riddle to them,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.816
just to see, to gauge the level of change.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.896
Well, 16-year-old boys,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.936
they immediately turned to me
and said, "It's his mom." Right?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.736
No problem. Just like that.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.616
Except for my son, who said,
"Well, he could have two dads."

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.136
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.976
That's an index, an indicator
of how things have changed.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.816
Younger men today expect
to be able to balance work and family.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.136
They want to be dual-career,
dual-carer couples.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.856
They want to be able to balance
work and family with their partners.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.776
They want to be involved fathers.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.936
Now, it turns out

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.336
that the more egalitarian
our relationships,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.160
the happier both partners are.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.896
Data from psychologists and sociologists
are quite persuasive here.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.576
I think we have the persuasive numbers,
the data, to prove to men

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.776
that gender equality
is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.576
Here's what the data show.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.136
Now, when men begin
the process of engaging

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.936
with balancing work and family,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.136
we often have two phrases
that we use to describe what we do.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.696
We pitch in and we help out.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.936
(Laughter)

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.856
And I'm going to propose
something a little bit more radical,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.096
one word: "share."

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.856
(Laughter)

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.536
Because here's what the data show:

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.856
when men share housework and childcare,

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.960
their children do better in school.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.216
Their children have lower rates
of absenteeism,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.776
higher rates of achievement.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.536
They are less likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.416
They are less likely
to see a child psychiatrist.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.560
They are less likely
to be put on medication.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.920
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.696
their children are happier and healthier,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.400
and men want this.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.936
When men share housework and childcare,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.600
their wives are happier. Duh.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.176
Not only that, their wives are healthier.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.391
Their wives are less likely
to see a therapist,

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:04.463
less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,

00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:08.256
less likely to be put on medication,
more likely to go to the gym,

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.336
report higher levels
of marital satisfaction.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.376
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.256
their wives are happier and healthier,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.200
and men certainly want this as well.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.936
When men share housework and childcare,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.696
the men are healthier.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.536
They smoke less, drink less,
take recreational drugs less often.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.256
They are less likely to go to the ER

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.456
but more like to go to a doctor
for routine screenings.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.416
They are less likely to see a therapist,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.536
less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.056
less likely to be taking
prescription medication.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.096
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.296
the men are happier and healthier.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.680
And who wouldn't want that?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.896
And finally,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.856
when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.096
they have more sex.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.536
(Laughter)

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.976
Now, of these four fascinating findings,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.936
which one do you think
Men's Health magazine put on its cover?

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.576
(Laughter)

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600
"Housework Makes Her Horny.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.016
(Not When She Does It.)"

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.696
(Laughter)

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.976
Now, I will say,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.976
just to remind the men in the audience,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.816
these data were collected
over a really long period of time,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.656
so I don't want listeners to say,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.696
"Hmm, OK, I think
I'll do the dishes tonight."

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.696
These data were collected
over a really long period of time.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.120
But I think it shows something important,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.936
that when Men's Health magazine
put it on their cover,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.199
they also called,
you'll love this, "Choreplay."

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.216
So, what we found
is something really important,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.336
that gender equality

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.416
is in the interest of countries,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.576
of companies, and of men,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.136
and their children and their partners,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.616
that gender equality
is not a zero-sum game.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.896
It's not a win-lose.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.136
It is a win-win for everyone.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.416
And what we also know

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.016
is we cannot fully empower women and girls

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.696
unless we engage boys and men.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.920
We know this.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.776
And my position is

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.016
that men need the very things
that women have identified

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.096
that they need to live the lives
they say they want to live

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.280
in order to live the lives
that we say we want to live.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.816
In 1915, on the eve of one
of the great suffrage demonstrations

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.816
down Fifth Avenue in New York City,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.496
a writer in New York
wrote an article in a magazine,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.536
and the title of the article was,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.360
"Feminism for Men."

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.136
And this was the first line
of that article:

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.136
"Feminism will make it possible
for the first time for men to be free."

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.376
Thank you.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:56.120
(Applause)
