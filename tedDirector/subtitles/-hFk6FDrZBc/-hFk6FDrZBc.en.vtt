00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
which, as some of you may know,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.160
So that's why I've always been fascinated

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
with how technology could actually reshape

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
and open up authoritarian societies like ours.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
So, I'm graduating college

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and, feeling very idealistic,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
I decided to join the NGO

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
which actually was using new media

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
to promote democracy and media reform

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
in much of the former Soviet Union.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
However, to my surprise,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
I discovered that dictatorships

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
do not crumble so easily.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
In fact, some of them actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
survived the Internet challenge,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
and some got even more repressive.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
decided to quit my NGO job

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Now, I must tell you that this was never

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
a very popular argument,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and it's probably not very popular yet

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
with some of you sitting in this audience.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
It was never popular with many political leaders,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
especially those in the United States

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
who somehow thought that new media

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160
would be able to do what missiles couldn't.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
That is, promote democracy in difficult places

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
where everything else has already been tried and failed.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And I think by 2009,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
this news has finally reached Britain,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
However, there is an underlying argument about logistics,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
which has driven so much of this debate. Right?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
So if you look at it close enough,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
you'll actually see that much of this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
is about economics.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
The cybertopians say, much like fax machines

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
and Xerox machines did in the '80s,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
blogs and social networks

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.160
have radically transformed the economics of protest,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
so people would inevitably rebel.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
To put it very simply,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
the assumption so far has been

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
that if you give people enough connectivity,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
if you give them enough devices,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
democracy will inevitably follow.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And to tell you the truth,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
I never really bought into this argument,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
in part because I never saw three American presidents

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
agree on anything else in the past.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
(Laughter)

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
But, you know, even beyond that,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
if you think about the logic underlying it,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
is something I call iPod liberalism,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
who happens to have and love his iPod

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
will also love liberal democracy.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
And again, I think this is kind of false.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
But I think a much bigger problem with this

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
is that this logic --

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I mean, it would make a fascinating title

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
for Thomas Friedman's new book.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160
(Laughter)

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.160
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
So, the bigger problem with this logic

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
is that it confuses the intended

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
versus the actual uses of technology.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
For those of you who think that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
new media of the Internet

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
could somehow help us avert genocide,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
should look no further than Rwanda,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
But even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
what you can actually see

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160
is that certain governments

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
have mastered the use of cyberspace

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
for propaganda purposes. Right?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
And they are building what I call the Spinternet.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
The combination of spin, on the one hand,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
and the Internet on the other.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
So governments from Russia to China to Iran

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160
in order to leave ideological comments

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and create a lot of ideological blog posts

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
to comment on sensitive political issues. Right?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Why are they engaging with cyberspace?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Well my theory is that

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
it's happening because censorship actually

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160
The moment you put something critical in a blog,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
even if you manage to ban it immediately,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So the more you block it,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.160
the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.160
So the only way to control this message

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
is actually to try to spin it

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and accuse anyone who has written something critical

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
of being, for example, a CIA agent.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And, again, this is happening quite often.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
There was a big case in February 2009

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
called "Elude the Cat."

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
a Chinese man, died in prison custody.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
And police said that it happened

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
because he was playing hide and seek,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160
which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.160
with other inmates and hit his head

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
against the wall,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.160
which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
had 35,000 comments

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
on this issue within hours.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.160
But then authorities did something very smart.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160
Instead of trying to purge these comments,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
So 500 people applied,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
and thus inspect it and then blog about it.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Within days the entire incident was forgotten,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
People would keep talking about it for weeks.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
And this actually fits with another interesting theory

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
about what's happening in authoritarian states

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
and in their cyberspace.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.160
This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.160
and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and letting them engage with each other online.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
We tend to think

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.160
that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160
but in many cases it only strengthens them.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
And you may wonder why.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
I'll just give you a very short list of reasons

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
why authoritarian deliberation

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
may actually help the dictators.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
And first it's quite simple.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
They don't really have the data they need

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
So encouraging people to actually go online

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160
and share information and data

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160
on blogs and wikis is great

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.160
will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160
produce knowledge has been great.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Secondly, involving public in any decision making

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
is also great

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
because it helps you to share the blame

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
for the policies which eventually fail.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
Because they say, "Well look, we asked you,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
we consulted you, you voted on it.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
You put it on the front page of your blog.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
And finally, the purpose of

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
any authoritarian deliberation efforts

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.160
having them participate in decision making,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
it's actually great.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160
Because what happens is that then

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
you can actually point to this initiative and say,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160
"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Just to give you an example,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
one of the Russian regions, for example,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
now involves its citizens

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
in planning its strategy up until year 2020.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
Right? So they can go online

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160
and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
So having people involved in planning for 2020

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
is not necessarily going to change anything,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
Just to give you an example from Iran,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
we all heard about the Twitter revolution

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
that happened there,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
but if you look close enough, you'll actually see

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that many of the networks and blogs

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.160
and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
They may have become slower,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
but the activists could still access it

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
and actually argue that having access to them

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
is actually great for many authoritarian states.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160
And it's great simply because

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
they can gather open source intelligence.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
In the past it would take you weeks, if not months,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
Now you actually know how they connect to each other

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
by looking at their Facebook page.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
I mean KGB, and not just KGB,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
used to torture in order to actually get this data.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
Now it's all available online.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
(Laughter)

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
that cybertopians made

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
We often hear about cyber activism,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
how people are getting more active because of the Internet.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
how people are becoming passive.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
is going to be the catalyst of change

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
that will push young people into the streets,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
That's not an option being considered too strongly.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
there may as well be two digital captives

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.160
who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
and it plays a completely different social role for them.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
If you look at some of the surveys

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
is three times more than in the United States.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160
So it does play a social role,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
So the way I tend to think of it

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160
But the point here is that

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
when we get the remote Russian village online,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
what will get people to the Internet

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160
or maybe watching funny videos of cats.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
So this is something you have to recognize.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160
So what should we do about it?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160
Well I say we have to stop thinking

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
about the number of iPods per capita

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
and start thinking about ways in which

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
we can empower intellectuals,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Because even what has been happening up 'til now

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and actually start doing something about it.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Thank you.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
(Applause)
