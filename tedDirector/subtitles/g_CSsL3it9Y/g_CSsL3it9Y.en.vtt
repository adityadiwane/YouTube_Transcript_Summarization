00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now I'm going to give you a story.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let me begin with my parents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm a product of this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
visionary mother and father.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
'50s and '60s

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
didn't belong to girls in India.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They belonged to boys.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They belonged to boys who would join business

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and inherit business from parents,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and girls would be dolled up to get married.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My family, in my city,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and almost in the country, was unique.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We were four of us, not one,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and fortunately no boys.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We were four girls and no boys.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And my parents were part

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of a landed property family.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
My father defied his own grandfather,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
almost to the point of disinheritance,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because he decided to educate

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
all four of us.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and gave us the best education.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Children don't choose a school.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They just get the school which parents choose for them.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So this is the foundation time which I got.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And my father used to say at that time,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm the only one who's left in India.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
One is a British, another is an American

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the third is a Canadian.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So we are four of us in four corners of the world.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And since I said they're my role models,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
One, they said, "Life is on an incline.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You either go up,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or you come down."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And the second thing, which has stayed with me,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
which became my philosophy of life,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
which made all the difference,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Out of 100, 90 are your creation.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's like a death of a relative,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can't do a thing about it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You've got to just respond to the situation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But that response comes out of those 90 points.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Since I'm a product of this philosophy,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of 90/10,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and secondly, "life on an incline,"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that's the way I grew up

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to be valuing what I got.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm a product of opportunities,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which girls didn't get,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was something unique.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to get married with a lot of dowry,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I thought I must tell you this.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Why I said this, is the background.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is what comes next.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a woman with indefatigable stamina,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But I joined the Indian Police Service,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and then it was a new pattern of policing.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
For me the policing stood for power to correct,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
power to prevent and power to detect.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
the power to prevent.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
or power to punish.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because that's what I learned when I was growing up.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So this was how it came into my service,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and it was different from the men.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because this was the way I was different.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I redefined policing concepts in India.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm going to take you on two journeys,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
my policing journey and my prison journey.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
What you see, if you see the title

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
called "PM's car held."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This was the first time a prime minister of India

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
was given a parking ticket.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Laughter)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's the first time in India,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It'll never happen again in India,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
because now it was once and forever.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And the rule was, because I was sensitive,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and I was very pro-justice.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I had other options, but I didn't choose them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So I'm going to move on.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This is about tough policing, equal policing.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
postings which others would say no.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Normally police officers don't want to do prison.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
They sent me to prison to lock me up,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
thinking, "Now there will be no cars

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and no VIPs to be given tickets to.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Let's lock her up."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Here I got a prison assignment.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Obviously, it was.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But 10,000 men,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
9,000 plus about 600

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
were men.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Terrorists, rapists,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
burglars, gangsters --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
some of them I'd sent to jail

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
as a police officer outside.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And then how did I deal with them?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
The first day when I went in,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I didn't know how to look at them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I said, "Do you pray?"

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And they didn't say anything.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I prayed for them, and things started to change.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is a visual of education inside the prison.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Friends, this has never happened,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
where everybody in the prison studies.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I started this with community support.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Government had no budget.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
in any prison in the world.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This was initiated in Delhi prison.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
You see one sample

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of a prisoner teaching a class.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
These are hundreds of classes.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the same den in which they thought

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We converted this into an ashram --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
from a prison to an ashram through education.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I think that's the bigger change.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It was the beginning of a change.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Books came from donated schoolbooks.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Stationery was donated.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Everything was donated,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
because there was no budget of education for the prison.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now if I'd not done that,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it would have been a hellhole.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That's the second landmark.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
One, the numbers you'll never get to see.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Secondly, this concept.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This was a meditation program inside the prison

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
of over 1,000 prisoners.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This was one of the most courageous steps

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I took as a prison governor.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And this is what transformed.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You want to know more about this,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
You will hear about it, and you will love it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And write to me on KiranBedi.com,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and I'll respond to you.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Let me show you the next slide.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I took the same concept of mindfulness,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Not by preaching, not by telling,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
not by reading, but by addressing your mind.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I took the same thing to the police,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and that the people don't cooperate.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This worked.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This is a feedback box called a petition box.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This is a concept which I introduced

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This was a magic box.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
This was a sensitive box.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
If you see somebody in the blue --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
yeah, this guy --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Let me wrap it up.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I'm currently into movements,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
movements of education

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
of the under-served children,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
That's a big way

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we, as a small group of activists,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Friends, you will hear a lot about it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and that's the movement and ambition of my life.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Thank you very much.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Applause)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
