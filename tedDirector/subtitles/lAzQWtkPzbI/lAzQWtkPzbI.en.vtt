00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:16.619
Two hundred years of modern science.

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:18.829
We have to admit

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:20.518
that our performance is not great.

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:24.331
The machines we build continue
to suffer from mechanical failures.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.767
The houses we build
do not survive severe earthquakes.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:32.764
But we shouldn't be so critical
of our scientists for a simple reason:

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:35.272
they didn't have much time.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.400
Two hundred years is not a lot of time,

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:41.647
while nature had three billion years

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:45.273
to perfect some of the most
amazing materials,

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:47.434
that we wish we had in our possession.

00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:52.902
Remember, these materials
carry a quality assurance

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:54.810
of three billion years.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:57.525
Take, for example, sequoia trees.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.696
They carry hundreds of tons
for hundreds of years

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:05.161
in cold weather, in warm climates,

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:06.528
UV light.

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:11.125
Yet, if you look at the structure
by high-resolution electron microscopy,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.172
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:16.968
surprisingly, it's made of sugar.

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:19.801
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:23.736
It's actually a nanofiber
called nanocrystalline cellulose.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.725
And this nanocrystalline cellulose
is so strong, on a weight basis,

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.068
it's about 10 times stronger than steel.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.846
Yet it's made of sugar.

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.362
So scientists all over the world
believe that nanocellulose

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.598
is going to be one of the most important
materials for the entire industry.

00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:45.772
But here's the problem:

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:48.797
say you want to buy
a half a ton of nanocellulose

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.440
to build a boat or an airplane.

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:54.392
Well, you can Google, you can eBay,
you can even Alibaba.

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.707
You won't find it.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.795
Of course, you're going to find
thousands of scientific papers --

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.636
great papers, where scientists
are going to say this is a great material,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.764
there are lots of things
we can do with it.

00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:09.292
But no commercial source.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:14.974
So we at the Hebrew University,
together with our partners in Sweden,

00:02:14.998 --> 00:02:20.649
decided to focus on the development
of an industrial-scale process

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.347
to produce this nanocellulose.

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:25.595
And, of course,
we didn't want to cut trees.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.950
So we were looking for another source

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:30.326
of raw material,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.966
and we found one -- in fact,
the sludge of the paper industry.

00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:37.582
The reason: there is a lot of it.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.969
Europe alone produces 11 million tons

00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:43.534
of that material annually.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:49.054
It's the equivalent of a mountain
three kilometers high,

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:50.509
sitting on a soccer field.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.263
And we produce this mountain every year.

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:57.170
So for everybody,
it's an environmental problem,

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:59.470
and for us, it's a gold mine.

00:03:00.923 --> 00:03:05.085
So now, we are actually producing,
on an industrial scale in Israel,

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.660
nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.

00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:09.834
We can do a lot of things
with the material.

00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:11.233
For example,

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:15.092
we have shown that by adding
only a small percent of nanocellulose

00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:18.913
into cotton fibers, the same
as my shirt is made of,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.786
it increases its strength dramatically.

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:27.142
So this can be used
for making amazing things,

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:32.466
like super-fabrics for industrial
and medical applications.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.913
But this is not the only thing.

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:38.791
For example, self-standing,
self-supporting structures,

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:41.411
like the shelters that you can see now,

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:46.234
actually are now showcasing
in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:51.875
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders

00:03:52.683 --> 00:03:54.001
in the plant kingdom.

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:56.491
Think about insects.

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.086
Cat fleas, for example,

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.950
have the ability to jump
about a hundred times their height.

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:04.319
That's amazing.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.939
It's the equivalent of a person

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:10.406
standing in the middle
of Liberty Island in New York,

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:12.588
and in a single jump,

00:04:12.612 --> 00:04:15.492
going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:19.212
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:20.535
So the question is:

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.520
How do cat fleas do it?

00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:26.211
It turns out, they make
this wonderful material,

00:04:26.235 --> 00:04:27.961
which is called resilin.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.376
In simple words, resilin,
which is a protein,

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:36.145
is the most elastic rubber on Earth.

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:39.733
You can stretch it,

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:41.384
you can squish it,

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:44.699
and it doesn't lose almost any energy
to the environment.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.532
When you release it -- snap!

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:49.181
It brings back all the energy.

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.092
So I'm sure everybody
would like to have that material.

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:54.488
But here's the problem:

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.418
to catch cat fleas is difficult.

00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:59.384
(Laughter)

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:01.245
Why? Because they are jumpy.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.790
(Laughter)

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:07.748
But now, it's actually
enough to catch one.

00:05:08.653 --> 00:05:10.749
Now we can extract its DNA

00:05:10.773 --> 00:05:13.881
and read how cat fleas make the resilin,

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:18.628
and clone it into a less-jumpy
organism like a plant.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.354
So that's exactly what we did.

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:24.684
Now we have the ability
to produce lots of resilin.

00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:29.097
Well, my team decided to do something
really cool at the university.

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.078
They decided to combine

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:34.324
the strongest material
produced by the plant kingdom

00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:38.129
with the most elastic material
produced by the insect kingdom --

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.780
nanocellulose with resilin.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.829
And the result is amazing.

00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:49.184
This material, in fact, is tough,
elastic and transparent.

00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:53.422
So there are lots of things
that can be done with this material.

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:55.596
For example, next-generation sport shoes,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.407
so we can jump higher, run faster.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.385
And even touch screens
for computers and smartphones,

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.783
that won't break.

00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:08.791
Well, the problem is,
we continue to implant

00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:10.903
synthetic implants in our body,

00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:13.673
which we glue and screw into our body.

00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:16.861
And I'm going to say
that this is not a good idea.

00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:18.796
Why? Because they fail.

00:06:19.103 --> 00:06:20.559
This synthetic material fails,

00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:22.632
just like this plastic fork,

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:25.798
that is not strong enough
for its performance.

00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:28.149
But sometimes they are too strong,

00:06:28.173 --> 00:06:31.244
and therefore their mechanical
properties do not really fit

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:32.758
their surrounding tissues.

00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:36.229
But in fact, the reason
is much more fundamental.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.509
The reason is that in nature,

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.412
there is no one there

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:45.092
that actually takes my head
and screws it onto my neck,

00:06:45.727 --> 00:06:48.401
or takes my skin
and glues it onto my body.

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:51.822
In nature, everything is self-assembled.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.470
So every living cell,

00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:59.128
whether coming from a plant,
insect or human being,

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:03.235
has a DNA that encodes
for nanobio building blocks.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:04.808
Many times they are proteins.

00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:08.949
Other times, they are enzymes
that make other materials,

00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:11.060
like polysaccharides, fatty acids.

00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:14.427
And the common feature
about all these materials

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:16.883
is that they need no one.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.606
They recognize each other
and self-assemble

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.529
into structures -- scaffolds
on which cells are proliferating

00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:26.993
to give tissues.

00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:30.204
They develop into organs,
and together bring life.

00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:37.056
So we at the Hebrew University,
about 10 years ago, decided to focus

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.058
on probably the most important
biomaterial for humans,

00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:44.291
which is collagen.

00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:46.332
Why collagen?

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:50.070
Because collagen accounts for
about 25 percent of our dry weight.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:53.698
We have nothing more than collagen,
other than water, in our body.

00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:56.584
So I always like to say,

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:59.703
anyone who is in the replacement
parts of human beings

00:07:59.727 --> 00:08:01.161
would like to have collagen.

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:04.687
Admittedly, before we started our project,

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:08.354
there were already more
than 1,000 medical implants

00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:09.780
made of collagen.

00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:13.660
You know, simple things like
dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,

00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:15.063
augment lips,

00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:19.356
and other, more sophisticated
medical implants, like heart valves.

00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:21.306
So where is the problem?

00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:23.806
Well, the problem is the source.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.655
The source of all that collagen

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:29.621
is actually coming from dead bodies:

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:31.755
dead pigs, dead cows

00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:33.858
and even human cadavers.

00:08:34.342 --> 00:08:36.582
So safety is a big issue.

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.185
But it's not the only one.

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.003
Also, the quality.

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:44.010
Now here, I have a personal interest.

00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:47.208
This is my father, Zvi,
in our winery in Israel.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:50.954
A heart valve, very similar
to the one that I showed you before,

00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:54.751
seven years ago,
was implanted in his body.

00:08:55.941 --> 00:09:01.077
Now, the scientific literature says
that these heart valves start to fail

00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:03.144
10 years after the operation.

00:09:04.446 --> 00:09:05.660
No wonder:

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.791
they are made from old, used tissues,

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:14.156
just like this wall made of bricks
that is falling apart.

00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:18.219
Yeah, of course, I can take
those bricks and build a new wall.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.646
But it's not going to be the same.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.132
So the US Food and Drug Administration

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.275
made a notice already in 2007,

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:31.346
asking the companies to start to look
for better alternatives.

00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:33.938
So that's exactly what we did.

00:09:34.892 --> 00:09:39.534
We decided to clone all the five
human genes responsible

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.783
for making type I collagen in humans

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:46.926
into a transgenic tobacco plant.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:53.224
So now, the plant has the ability
to make human collagen brand new,

00:09:53.248 --> 00:09:54.404
untouched.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.661
This is amazing.

00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:58.176
Actually, it's happening now.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:04.015
Today in Israel, we grow it
in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.284
all over the country.

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:08.517
The farmers receive
small plantlets of tobacco.

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.491
It looks exactly like regular tobacco,

00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:13.046
except that they have five human genes.

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:15.771
They're responsible for making
type I collagen.

00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:19.620
We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,

00:10:20.628 --> 00:10:21.850
we harvest the leaves,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.405
and then the leaves are transported
by cooling trucks to the factory.

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:30.040
There, the process of extracting
the collagen starts.

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:34.042
Now, if you ever made a pesto --
essentially, the same thing.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.582
(Laughter)

00:10:36.198 --> 00:10:40.387
You crush the leaves, you get
the juice that contains the collagen.

00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.305
We concentrate the protein,

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:45.596
transfer the protein to clean rooms
for the final purification,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.940
and the end result is a collagen
identical to what we have in our body --

00:10:51.956 --> 00:10:53.655
untouched, brand new

00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:56.737
and from which we make
different medical implants:

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.111
bone void fillers, for example,

00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:04.433
for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.

00:11:05.068 --> 00:11:06.633
And more recently, even,

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:11.029
we've been able to launch
into the market here in Europe

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.133
a flowable gel that is used
for diabetic foot ulcers,

00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.794
that is now approved
for use in the clinic.

00:11:18.823 --> 00:11:20.351
This is not science fiction.

00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:22.367
This is happening now.

00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:26.937
We are using plants
to make medical implants

00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:28.969
for replacement parts for human beings.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.071
In fact, more recently,
we've been able to make collagen fibers

00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:37.392
which are six times stronger
than the Achilles tendon.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.117
That's amazing.

00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:42.023
Together with our partners from Ireland,

00:11:42.047 --> 00:11:43.762
we thought about the next thing:

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:46.358
adding resilin to those fibers.

00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:48.608
By doing that,

00:11:48.632 --> 00:11:51.430
we've been able to make a superfiber

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:54.428
which is about 380 percent tougher,

00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:57.487
and 300 percent more elastic.

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:00.591
So oddly enough, in the future,

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:05.575
when a patient is transplanted
with artificial tendons or ligaments

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:07.329
made from these fibers,

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:10.932
we'll have better performance
after the surgery

00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:12.685
than we had before the injury.

00:12:13.642 --> 00:12:15.367
So what's for the future?

00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:18.392
In the future, we believe
we'll be able to make

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:21.993
many nanobio building blocks
that nature provided for us --

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:25.857
collagen, nanocellulose,
resilin and many more.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.073
And that will enable us to make
better machines perform better,

00:12:30.097 --> 00:12:31.279
even the heart.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.097
Now, this heart
is not going to be the same

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.263
as we can get from a donor.

00:12:36.977 --> 00:12:38.286
It will be better.

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:40.866
It actually will perform better

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.191
and will last longer.

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:45.390
My friend Zion Suliman once told me

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:47.627
a smart sentence.

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:51.338
He said, "If you want a new idea,

00:12:51.362 --> 00:12:52.991
you should open an old book."

00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:56.933
And I'm going to say
that the book was written.

00:12:57.815 --> 00:12:59.956
It was written over three billion years

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.137
of evolution.

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:04.621
And the text is the DNA of life.

00:13:05.923 --> 00:13:07.137
All we have to do

00:13:07.816 --> 00:13:09.196
is read this text,

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.713
embrace nature's gift to us

00:13:12.737 --> 00:13:14.725
and start our progress from here.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.413
Thank you.

00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:20.317
