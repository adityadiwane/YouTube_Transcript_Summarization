00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.619
As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:26.978
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the

00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:29.055
early part of the 20th century.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.971
It used mirrors

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.769
to create the illusion of tiny people

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.809
performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.905
but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:49.368
So let the story begin.

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:54.306
On a dark and stormy night -- really! --

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:58.409
it was the 10th of July, 1856.

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:00.361
Lightning lit the sky,

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.448
and a baby was born.

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:05.456
His name was Nikola,

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:07.100
Nikola Tesla.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.120
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.264
Let me show you.

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:19.812
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:24.358
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:28.931
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.

00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:31.084
When a word was mentioned,

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.147
an image of it

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:35.348
instantly appeared in his mind.

00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:41.060
Tree. Chair. Girl.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.243
They were hallucinations, which vanished

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:46.092
the moment he touched them.

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:49.660
Probably a form of synesthesia.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.084
But it was something

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:54.676
he later turned to his advantage.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:58.663
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:02.782
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:08.960
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.108
MT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.870
he would build them in his workshop.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.642
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:23.399
I could picture them as real in my mind,

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.929
and there I run it, test it and improve it.

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.783
Only then do I construct it.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:30.880
MT: His great idea

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.031
was alternating current.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.535
But how could he convince the public that

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:40.569
the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.311
To sell his idea,

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.895
he became a showman.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:50.197
NT: We are at the dawn of a new age,

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.424
the age of electricity.

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:56.130
I have been able, through careful invention, to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.590
transmit, with the mere flick of a switch,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.851
electricity across the ether.

00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.198
It is the magic of science.

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:06.790
(Applause)

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.518
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name:

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:18.366
radio, wireless telegraphy,

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:25.681
remote control, robotics.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:31.087
He even photographed the bones of the human body.

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:35.639
But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream:

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.911
harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls,

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:45.407
and bringing light to the city.

00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:52.591
But Tesla's success didn't last.

00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.064
NT: I had bigger ideas.

00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:58.246
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:02.990
A world telegraphy center -- imagine news,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.937
messages, sounds, images delivered to

00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:08.590
any point in the world

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.543
instantly and wirelessly.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:17.035
MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project. Expensive, too.

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:19.690
NT: They wouldn't give me the money.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.928
MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:27.151
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.

00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:31.369
MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:33.225
He became a recluse.

00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:35.025
Dodged by death,

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.769
he spent much of his time

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.697
in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:45.105
NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind,

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:52.024
for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich,

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:55.904
where products of intellect, science and art

00:04:55.904 --> 00:05:01.877
will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life.

00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:07.755
MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of
January, 1943.

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:09.906
His final resting place

00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:13.370
is a golden globe that contains his ashes

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.690
at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.203
His legacy is with us still.

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:24.415
Tesla became the man who lit the world,

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.775
but this was only the beginning.

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:30.159
Tesla's insight was profound.

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.078
NT: Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear,

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:38.655
and the coal deposits are exhausted?

00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:41.135
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer.

00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:48.346
We are still asking the question.

00:05:48.346 --> 00:05:50.560
Thank you.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.089
(Applause)
