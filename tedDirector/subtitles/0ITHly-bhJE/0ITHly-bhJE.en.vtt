00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:14.913
I wanted to just start
by asking everyone a question:

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:17.183
How many of you are completely comfortable

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:18.961
with calling yourselves a leader?

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:22.558
I've asked that question
all across the country,

00:00:22.582 --> 00:00:24.559
and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:28.116
there's a huge portion of the audience
that won't put up their hand.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.636
And I've come to realize
that we have made leadership

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.070
into something bigger than us;
something beyond us.

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:34.967
We've made it about changing the world.

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:36.626
We've taken this title of "leader"

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.578
and treat it as something
that one day we're going to deserve.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:41.389
But to give it to ourselves right now

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:44.848
means a level of arrogance or cockiness
that we're not comfortable with.

00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:47.395
And I worry sometimes
that we spend so much time

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:50.252
celebrating amazing things
that hardly anybody can do,

00:00:50.276 --> 00:00:53.826
that we've convinced ourselves those
are the only things worth celebrating.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.257
We start to devalue the things
we can do every day,

00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.437
We take moments
where we truly are a leader

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.968
and we don't let ourselves take credit
for it, or feel good about it.

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:04.093
I've been lucky enough
over the last 10 years

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:07.148
to work with amazing people
who've helped me redefine leadership

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:09.196
in a way that I think has made me happier.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.434
With my short time today,

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:14.129
I want to share with you the one story
that is probably most responsible

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:15.316
for that redefinition.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.309
I went to a little school

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.147
called Mount Allison University
in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:22.830
And on my last day there,
a girl came up to me and said,

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:24.996
"I remember the first time I met you."

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.146
And she told me a story
that had happened four years earlier.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.505
She said, "On the day
before I started university,

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.593
I was in the hotel room
with my mom and dad,

00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:35.487
and I was so scared
and so convinced that I couldn't do this,

00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:38.571
that I wasn't ready for university,
that I just burst into tears.

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:39.936
My mom and dad were amazing.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.122
They were like, "We know you're scared,
but let's just go tomorrow,

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:46.631
go to the first day, and if at any point
you feel as if you can't do this,

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:48.814
that's fine; tell us,
and we'll take you home.

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:50.235
We love you no matter what.'"

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.886
She says, "So I went the next day.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.394
I was in line for registration,

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:56.722
and I looked around and just knew
I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.

00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:57.897
I knew I had to quit.

00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:00.072
I made that decision
and as soon as I made it,

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:02.168
an incredible feeling
of peace came over me.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:05.270
I turned to my mom and dad
to tell them we needed to go home,

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:08.207
and at that moment, you came
out of the student union building

00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:10.722
wearing the stupidest hat
I've ever seen in my life."

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:11.747
(Laughter)

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.022
"It was awesome.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:15.251
And you had a big sign
promoting Shinerama," --

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.304
which is Students Fighting
Cystic Fibrosis,

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:19.193
a charity I've worked with for years --

00:02:19.217 --> 00:02:21.037
"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:23.564
You were handing the lollipops out
to people in line,

00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:24.931
and talking about Shinerama.

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:28.097
All of the sudden, you got to me,
and you just stopped.

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.262
And you stared. It was creepy."

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:31.737
(Laughter)

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.692
This girl knows what I'm talking about.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.718
(Laughter)

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:38.374
"Then you looked at the guy next to me,
smiled, reached into your bucket,

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.854
pulled out a lollipop,
held it out to him and said,

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.020
'You need to give a lollipop
to the beautiful woman next to you.'"

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:47.984
She said, "I've never seen anyone
get more embarrassed faster in my life.

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.258
He turned beet red,
he wouldn't even look at me.

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:52.627
He just kind of held
the lollipop out like this."

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:53.952
(Laughter)

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:56.549
"I felt so bad for this dude
that I took the lollipop.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:59.764
As soon as I did, you got
this incredibly severe look on your face,

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:03.072
looked at my mom and dad
and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:04.494
First day away from home,

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.025
and already she's taking candy
from a stranger?'"

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.192
(Laughter)

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:10.617
She said, "Everybody lost it.

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:13.324
Twenty feet in every direction,
everyone started to howl.

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:16.463
I know this is cheesy, and I don't know
why I'm telling you this,

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:19.909
but in that moment when everyone
was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.765
I knew I was where I was supposed
to be; I knew I was home.

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.122
And I haven't spoken to you
once in the four years since that day.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:29.228
But I heard that you were leaving,
and I had to come and tell you

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:31.829
you've been an incredibly
important person in my life.

00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:33.652
I'm going to miss you. Good luck."

00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:35.726
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.331
She gets six feet away,
turns around, smiles and goes,

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:40.098
"You should probably know this, too:

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.305
I'm still dating that guy,
four years later."

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.474
(Laughter)

00:03:43.498 --> 00:03:45.980
A year and a half
after I moved to Toronto,

00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:47.881
I got an invitation to their wedding.

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:48.912
(Laughter)

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:51.468
Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.845
I have no recollection of that moment.

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.315
I've searched my memory banks,

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.510
because that is funny and I should
remember doing it and I don't.

00:03:58.534 --> 00:04:01.317
That was such an eye-opening,
transformative moment for me,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.634
to think that maybe the biggest impact
I'd ever had on anyone's life,

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:08.147
a moment that had a woman walk up
to a stranger four years later and say,

00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.327
"You've been an important
person in my life,"

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.377
was a moment that I didn't even remember.

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.460
How many of you guys
have a lollipop moment,

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:16.554
a moment where someone
said or did something

00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:19.066
that you feel fundamentally
made your life better?

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.027
All right. How many of you have told
that person they did it?

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:23.644
See, why not?

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:24.819
We celebrate birthdays,

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:27.514
where all you have to do
is not die for 365 days --

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:28.695
(Laughter)

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.008
Yet we let people
who have made our lives better

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:32.516
walk around without knowing it.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.055
Every single one of you
has been the catalyst

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.230
for a lollipop moment.

00:04:36.254 --> 00:04:39.271
You've made someone's life better
by something you said or did.

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:40.490
If you think you haven't,

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.046
think of all the hands
that didn't go up when I asked.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.459
You're just one of the people
who hasn't been told.

00:04:45.483 --> 00:04:47.819
It's scary to think of ourselves
as that powerful,

00:04:47.843 --> 00:04:50.731
frightening to think we can matter
that much to other people.

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.422
As long as we make leadership
something bigger than us,

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:55.362
as long as we keep leadership beyond us

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:57.158
and make it about changing the world,

00:04:57.182 --> 00:04:59.769
we give ourselves an excuse
not to expect it every day,

00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:01.702
from ourselves and from each other.

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:05.309
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest
fear is not that we are inadequate.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.400
[It] is that we are powerful
beyond measure.

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:10.077
It is our light and not our darkness
that frightens us."

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.293
My call to action today
is that we need to get over our fear

00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:16.319
of how extraordinarily powerful
we can be in each other's lives.

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:18.597
We need to get over it
so we can move beyond it,

00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.391
and our little brothers and sisters
and one day our kids --

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:23.898
or our kids right now --
can watch and start to value

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.072
the impact we can have
on each other's lives,

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.682
more than money and power
and titles and influence.

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:31.848
We need to redefine leadership
as being about lollipop moments --

00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:34.402
how many of them we create,
how many we acknowledge,

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:37.613
how many of them we pay forward
and how many we say thank you for.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.257
Because we've made leadership
about changing the world,

00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:41.441
and there is no world.

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:43.624
There's only six billion
understandings of it.

00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:46.063
And if you change
one person's understanding of it,

00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:48.116
understanding of what they're capable of,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.449
understanding of how much
people care about them,

00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:53.075
understanding of how powerful
an agent for change

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.473
they can be in this world,

00:05:54.497 --> 00:05:55.992
you've changed the whole thing.

00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:58.539
And if we can understand
leadership like that,

00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:01.074
I think if we can redefine
leadership like that,

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:02.947
I think we can change everything.

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:05.741
And it's a simple idea,
but I don't think it's a small one.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.937
I want to thank you so much
for letting me share it with you today.
