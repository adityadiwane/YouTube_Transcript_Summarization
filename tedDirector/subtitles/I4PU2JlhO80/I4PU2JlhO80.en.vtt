00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:14.788
I'll tell you a little bit about my story
and who I am.

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:17.436
I'm a fashion photographer
based in New York City.

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:20.258
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines in New York,

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:25.056
I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire,

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:26.998
and for Interview and for GQ,

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:29.505
and I got to work 
with some really beautiful people.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:30.826
My studio is in New York,

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:33.047
but I also lived in Milan
for about eight years,

00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:34.746
and in Paris as well,

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:37.644
and worked for the house 
of Yves St. Laurent.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.358
I also did portraiture as well.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.904
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines,

00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:46.653
lots of great clients.

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:49.294
But I was always told,
every single day, who was beautiful.

00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:50.826
I was forced to work

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:53.268
within certain parameters 
of the beauty standard.

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.841
I was told, "This is the most 
amazing model of the moment,

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.227
you've got to photograph her.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:00:59.305
She's incredible, you've got to."

00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:01.421
And then the next season,
it would change again,

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.768
and I'd have to shift my ideas of beauty,

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:05.474
and so we'd go to the next model,

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:08.205
and it was kind of really crazy,
because I'm an artist.

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:09.849
I saw beauty everywhere.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.769
I didn't see beauty 
just on a magazine cover.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:15.764
I did a shoot with, of 
course, Cindy, for Revlon,

00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:18.602
and really fantastic, beautiful people.

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:19.888
But I thought,

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:22.590
someone's always telling me 
who's beautiful.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.086
And I was kind of frustrated.

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:25.840
I left my studio one 
afternoon in New York,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.461
and I was walking down Park Avenue,

00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:30.552
and I saw, waiting for a bus 
at the corner of Park and 20th,

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:32.593
this gorgeous kid.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:36.406
She had long, white, beautiful hair,
and pale, pale skin.

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:39.109
She had a genetic condition 
called albinism.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.939
I didn't know much about it, 
but she was stunning,

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.721
and I'd never met 
a model like this before.

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.281
And I went to grab her and say,

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.431
"I have to take your photograph, 
you're amazing!"

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.392
And the bus came, she got on, 
and then she took off,

00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:50.413
and I was really glad because she was 12,

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.324
and I'd be in prison at the moment.
(Laughter)

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:55.057
But really, it was 
extraordinary to see this kid.

00:01:55.057 --> 00:01:57.505
So I continued right down to Union Square,

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:58.916
to the huge Barnes and Noble,

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.548
and started pulling any books,
or any information I could

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:03.644
about this genetic condition, albinism.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:05.975
And I found really kind of sad images.

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:07.673
I didn't find images of this kid.

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:11.171
I found images of people 
sitting in hospital beds, looking sad,

00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:14.742
looking downtrodden, 
just images of despair.

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:18.105
I found images 
of a bright red eye, the albino eye.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.320
I'm thinking, 
this kid had beautiful blue eyes,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.785
she didn't have red eyes.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:23.812
And then I started seeing 
images from Africa,

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:27.322
where kids were surrounded by tribes 
pointing spears at them

00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.261
or in cancer wards and clinics,

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:32.114
or they're just in beds, 
and images of illness,

00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:34.107
of sadness, of sickness.

00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:35.661
And then, I started, of course,

00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:37.161
going through
those same medical textbooks,

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.362
and started finding 
these typical images

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:42.996
of kids and adults in their underwear, 
against walls in doctor's offices,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.118
with the black bar across their eyes 
saying "disease."

00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:48.572
This is a disease, defined by a disease.

00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:51.186
And I was like, this is crazy.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:52.964
And then I started going into it further,

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.308
looking on the Internet,

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:56.068
and all these different medical textbooks,

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.978
and everything was so sad, 
and so negative.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:03.125
I then started finding images 
of the albino freak family in the circus,

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.145
and then of course, 
all the movie references,

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.835
from "Powder," who had albinism because
his mother was struck by lightning,

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:13.467
to "The Princess Bride" and 
to "The Matrix Reloaded,"

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.157
there were the ghost-like twins 
that came in and wreaked havoc,

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:18.552
and destroyed things and then disappeared.

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:20.808
Even most recently, "The Da Vinci Code,"

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:23.698
there was like the evil albino 
driving around Paris at night,

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:25.944
killing people, shooting at people.

00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:27.949
Well, I found out, through my research,

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.193
that people with albinism 
have a visual impairment.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.507
There's always vision, 
but they're considered legally blind.

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:35.831
So they certainly wouldn't be driving 
around Paris at night

00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.971
shooting at anybody
and expect to hit anything.

00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.358
So I'm thinking, this is crazy.

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:41.852
So I contact NOAH.

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:46.753
Now, NOAH is the National Organization 
for Albinism and Hypopigmentation.

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.229
It's a support group for people 
living with this condition,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.575
and their families.

00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:52.611
And I'm like, "Hey, I'm a 
fashion photographer.

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:54.847
Let's show the world 
the beauty of albinism!"

00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:56.661
And they said, "Get lost."

00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:59.003
And I'm pretty persistent. I'm 
like, "Won't you talk to me?"

00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.934
And they made it very clear to me

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.135
about their fears of exploitation,

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:04.884
that every time there 
was a magazine article

00:04:04.884 --> 00:04:06.753
that came out about a kid with albinism,

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:08.460
it was a story about a victim.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.915
It was sad, or it was exploitative,

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:14.316
or sensational — never 
positive, always negative.

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.351
And I said, "Okay, well then, 
what do we do here?"

00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.067
So, let's form a nontraditional partnership —

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:22.685
fashion photographer, 
genetic support group —

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:24.092
and we'll work together.

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:25.150
And you can keep an eye on me

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.228
to make sure that we create 
something positive and powerful,

00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:30.797
showing the world the beauty of albinism.

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:31.988
And they said okay.

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:33.694
And I was like, fantastic, let's do this!

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:35.834
So in walks the first person 
I'm about to photograph.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:39.421
Her name is Christine, 
and Christine is a knockout.

00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:42.196
Long white hair, really tall. 
She's stunning.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:43.968
She walks into my studio.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:47.005
The way that she walks in, though, 
instead of this gorgeous girl,

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:49.538
she walks in like this, her head's down,

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:54.068
shoulders hunched, one-word answers, 
she looks down, no eye contact.

00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:58.020
This kid has been teased her whole life 
because of her difference.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.852
And it was so apparent in the fact 
that it left her with zero self-esteem.

00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:07.879
And I'm thinking, oh, this 
kid is just so fragile.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.752
And just the day before, 
I was shooting Cindy

00:05:09.752 --> 00:05:11.801
on the same set, in my studio.

00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.391
I'm thinking well, 
I have to be so careful with her — no,

00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:17.151
out of respect for this gorgeous kid,

00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.983
I'm going to photograph her 
like I would anybody else.

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:21.534
So the fan went on, the music went on,

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:23.075
and I grabbed a mirror 
that was next to the set,

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:24.992
and I held it up to her, and I said

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:29.071
Christine, look at yourself. 
You're magnificent.

00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:31.852
And she looked in the mirror, 
and she got it.

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:34.768
And she went from this to that.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:38.480
And that's our Christine, 
and she just exploded in front of the set.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.602
By the time she left the studio, 
she was kissing everybody on both cheeks,

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:45.602
and saying, "Ciao!" 
and she was unbelievable.

00:05:45.602 --> 00:05:48.799
And I saw this transformation 
right in front of the lens,

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:51.596
through photography, 
that she was now transformed,

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:54.943
with a powerful and positive sense 
of who she is.

00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:56.787
The next day, she goes to school,

00:05:56.787 --> 00:05:59.847
she's going to change the way 
her community sees her difference.

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:02.185
Instead of walking into 
that classroom like this,

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:03.608
she's walking in like this.

00:06:03.608 --> 00:06:06.046
So it's all about ambassadors for change.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:07.104
It was extraordinary.

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:09.894
And those first images, right after,
we did a series of them,

00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:13.327
using several individuals 
with this condition,

00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:16.541
they were in Life magazine in 1998.

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:17.911
So it was a while ago.

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.153
It was a cover story, 
it was a five-page spread.

00:06:20.153 --> 00:06:24.325
It was really a fantastic editorial.
It was great; I loved it.

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:27.632
Then we used a lot of the images, 
though, from Life,

00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:30.768
and put them in other magazines, 
magazines worldwide.

00:06:30.768 --> 00:06:34.435
Magazines in the U.K., in France, 
in Italy and Canada,

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:37.237
and other magazines in the States.
It was amazing.

00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:39.475
So this is from the U.K., Christine again.

00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:42.351
Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, 
and Kristen.

00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.913
That's Lauren. 
We did a campaign for sunglasses.

00:06:45.913 --> 00:06:48.606
A lot of kids with this condition 
are photophobic,

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:51.018
so they have 
a real strong light sensitivity.

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:53.988
So we thought, 
perfect for a sunglass campaign.

00:06:55.487 --> 00:06:57.518
People magazine did a great story.

00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:00.586
So it was circulating, 
people were saying all this great stuff.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.174
It was fantastic.

00:07:02.174 --> 00:07:03.724
So I was getting calls, though.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:06.428
Getting calls from the U.K.,
saying, well we just saw this spread,

00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:09.725
can you come photograph our 
kids with this condition?

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:12.253
We have a support group here, 
can you come meet our families?

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:14.370
People in Africa were calling in the same.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.342
New Zealand, can you help 
us start a support group?

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:19.133
I'm like, fantastic! 
This is great! Let's do it!

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:21.527
So I would travel in all these places,

00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:23.951
as I was shooting 
and doing my commercial work,

00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.436
I was at a local chapter conference 
in Philadelphia.

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:28.503
Small family conference, 
about 40 families,

00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:30.934
did my presentation of kids with albinism,

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:32.947
this mom came up to me, and she said,

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:35.281
"My son Randy, when he was a little boy,

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:37.848
he'd come home from school, 
and I could see the kids were teasing him,

00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:39.225
and he'd be in tears.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:42.313
And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone,
or a toy truck,

00:07:42.313 --> 00:07:43.655
and he'd forget about it."

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:46.574
She said, "Now he's in high school.
He comes home from school,

00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:50.018
I can see the pain, 
the anguish in his eyes.

00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:52.914
He walks in, he walks right past me,

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:54.482
goes up to his room, slams the door,

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:56.365
and I don't see him until the next day.

00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:57.976
He's not going to want to be photographed,

00:07:57.976 --> 00:07:59.317
he has zero self-esteem,

00:07:59.317 --> 00:08:04.383
this kid has such poor body image,
and he's just so shy.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:07.852
But if you could just show him 
photographs of kids his own age,

00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:10.068
so that he knows he's not alone."

00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:12.095
I'm like, "Of course. Where is he? Show me!"

00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:13.385
She points over to Randy.

00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:15.306
Now Randy's sitting there — 
his pants are hanging down to here,

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:18.158
his underwear's hanging out, 
he has this long, great big shirt,

00:08:18.158 --> 00:08:21.240
he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo.
He's amazing, this kid.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.874
I crawl over to Randy.

00:08:22.874 --> 00:08:26.244
I'm like, "Randy, 
I speak to moms and dads every single day,

00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:29.484
terrified about the future 
of their kids with albinism.

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:31.169
All they have to do 
is take one look at you,

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:32.403
and they're going to be fine.

00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:33.957
Please let me take a photo of you.

00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:35.122
Your mother said, she told me,

00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.848
that you didn't want to be photographed."

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:38.685
He said, "Rick, 
what do you mean?

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.402
You have to understand, I'm 16 years old.

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:43.139
I don't talk to my mother."

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.727
And then he said, "I want to be photographed.

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:48.784
I want to show the world that who I am,

00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:50.192
with my albinism, but also 
other things about me —"

00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:51.686
You see how shy he was.

00:08:51.686 --> 00:08:53.183
Very, very shy, Randy.

00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:55.895
But Randy created, 
early days in this idea,

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:58.027
of this nonprofit group 
Positive Exposure,

00:08:58.027 --> 00:08:59.549
the idea of networking stories,

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:02.939
sharing experiences and the images 
around the world.

00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:05.419
I'll kind of quickly go through the album.

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.192
I was very interested, at that point,

00:09:07.192 --> 00:09:09.251
getting calls from everybody in the world,

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.559
to find out more about this idea, 
a message, about albinism,

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:16.795
or perceptions of people in communities 
about this syndrome, albinism.

00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:20.322
So I started hearing about stigmas, 
and discrimination,

00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:23.695
so what I looked at is really trying 
to explore cultural perceptions

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:26.221
and attitudes towards this condition.

00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:28.928
This is my friend [unclear], 
who's a Kuna Indian

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:31.268
in the San Blas region of the world,

00:09:31.268 --> 00:09:34.602
the San Blas region of Panama.

00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:36.064
She's extraordinary.

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:39.618
So the incidence of albinism 
is about one in 20,000 worldwide.

00:09:39.618 --> 00:09:44.858
In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, 
the highest incidence in the world.

00:09:44.858 --> 00:09:48.458
We went to Fiji, actually, where we 
found out at the turn of the 19th century,

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:50.767
a tribe could not hold their territory

00:09:50.767 --> 00:09:55.225
unless they had somebody with albinism 
in a powerful political position.

00:09:55.225 --> 00:09:58.022
My great friend Keke, 
I photographed in New Zealand,

00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:00.769
she's from India, from Delhi,

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:04.037
but her family left Delhi 
because she was getting death threats.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.295
Now I'm thinking, 
this is horrible that they had to move,

00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:07.733
because she's eight years old.

00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:10.072
And we actually started 
a support group in Delhi,

00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:12.946
we found out that there are many kids
that we worked with in their communities,

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.829
after we started this group in India,

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.078
that have had really positive experiences.

00:10:17.078 --> 00:10:19.137
So one of the things 
we want to make very clear

00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:21.099
is that we're not making generalizations

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:22.611
about a community or a culture,

00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:24.545
and their reaction 
to people that are different.

00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:26.235
Keke's experiences were very different,

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:27.827
but we've met many kids there

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.209
that have been embraced 
by their communities throughout India.

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:34.272
A great friend Sue Anna from Korea.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:39.414
Tom, who was just adopted 
by an American family, from China,

00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:42.685
This is my great friend 
Harry from Puerto Rico.

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:43.928
And Natalia.

00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:47.591
She and I started 
the first albinism society in Russia.

00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:51.726
Maizan and her sister 
and mom in Malaysia.

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:54.725
Ceara. All she ever wanted to do 
was be a dancer.

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:56.841
She was told that 
because of her visual impairment,

00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:58.217
she'll never dance.

00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:01.283
She'll never be able to follow 
the choreography or the dance steps.

00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:05.804
She's like, they said, 
find another love, another passion.

00:11:05.804 --> 00:11:07.221
She's like, no.

00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:09.367
She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion,

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.647
and just started a school for dance 
for kids with visual impairment.

00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:15.850
I'm going to zip through this. 
Roz, from Australia.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.534
I spend a lot of time in Africa,

00:11:17.534 --> 00:11:20.310
where there's a high incidence 
of mortality associated with albinism,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.956
due to skin cancer.

00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:24.603
This is my friend Siri, 
who when she was born,

00:11:24.603 --> 00:11:26.504
the father's family 
put her out of the house,

00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:28.865
thinking she was cursed.

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.686
and Mom, not knowing what to do,

00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:33.771
put Siri in the sun to get her dark 
like her brothers and sisters.

00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:36.672
So you can see, it's all sun damage.

00:11:36.672 --> 00:11:40.980
A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa
were put in special schools,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.168
schools for the blind,

00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:46.237
not because the tools were better there 
for kids with visual impairment,

00:11:46.237 --> 00:11:48.640
but more importantly, 
because the teasing was so great,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.879
the discrimination is so great,

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:53.218
these kids don't do well 
in mainstream schools.

00:11:53.218 --> 00:11:56.688
I started an albinism society in Kenya 
with my friend C.K.,

00:11:56.688 --> 00:11:58.188
who actually went to a mainstream school.

00:11:58.188 --> 00:12:01.092
I'm like, C.K., how is it possible 
you went to a mainstream school?

00:12:01.092 --> 00:12:02.943
Nobody in Africa goes 
to mainstream schools.

00:12:02.943 --> 00:12:05.383
She said, "It's because 
of my twin sister, Delphine."

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:09.237
Fantastic. She said Delphine would get 
all the work off the board,

00:12:09.237 --> 00:12:11.627
the things I couldn't see, 
she'd help me with it.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:14.276
If the type was too small, 
she'd blow it up for me, she said.

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:16.408
But more importantly, 
when kids would tease me,

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:18.136
Delphine would beat them up.

00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:19.734
(Laughter)

00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:22.093
But on a sadder note, I was spending 
a lot of time in Tanzania,

00:12:22.093 --> 00:12:23.280
where witch doctors are saying,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.490
bring me the bones of an albino,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.760
and I'll make a potion
that will make you rich.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.922
So we're working very closely 
with the government there,

00:12:29.922 --> 00:12:31.638
I've been there six times 
in the last two years,

00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:37.862
to create public awareness programs
to save these kids.

00:12:37.862 --> 00:12:39.711
This is the dancer.

00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:41.900
This is in the Shinyanga region.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.739
This is one of the visuals 
that we created in East Africa,

00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:48.718
trying to fight and educate the public.

00:12:48.718 --> 00:12:51.986
I received the Art of Reporting award, 
from an organization

00:12:51.986 --> 00:12:54.040
called the Chromosome 18 Registry.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.789
The larger organization 
was the Genetic Alliance,

00:12:57.789 --> 00:12:59.768
which was a coalition 
of all the genetic support groups,

00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:02.788
and it was the award 
for the Life magazine piece.

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:04.268
The president at the time said,

00:13:04.268 --> 00:13:05.637
I'm also the founder and director

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:08.346
of the Chromosome 18 Research Society 
and Registry.

00:13:08.346 --> 00:13:10.587
I'm like, fantastic! 
That's great. What's that?

00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:13.803
She's like, well, if you have an anomaly 
on your 18th chromosome,

00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:17.071
then you have all kinds of problems 
and difficulties and challenges,

00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:20.387
and then we look after you, 
through this support group, like NOAH is.

00:13:20.387 --> 00:13:22.462
So I'm like, that's great.

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:24.427
She said, 
I see there's a universal message here,

00:13:24.427 --> 00:13:27.094
about all kids with differences, 
so it's not just about albinism.

00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:29.793
Would you come and speak 
to our families in San Antonio

00:13:29.793 --> 00:13:31.472
with these chromosome 18 anomalies?

00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:34.102
I'm like, sure! 
I went back to them thinking,

00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:35.502
what the hell is 
a chromosome 18 anomaly?

00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:36.952
I was an art major
at the school of visual arts,

00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:38.641
I had no idea.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:42.070
But I looked it up, 
these are the images that I saw.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.886
I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, 
this is going to be rough.

00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:46.961
But I went to San Antonio,

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.596
walked down to the auditorium 
where the kids and young adults were,

00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:51.488
opened the door, 
and I was instantly surrounded

00:13:51.488 --> 00:13:52.920
by kids screaming with laughter.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.404
There were kids with cleft palates, 
kids with mobility issues,

00:13:56.404 --> 00:13:59.346
feeding tubes, trachs, 
but they were kids, first and foremost.

00:13:59.346 --> 00:14:00.917
That's Rebecca and Pauline.

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:04.487
My great friend, that's Ellington. 
He's awesome.

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.109
Remy.

00:14:06.247 --> 00:14:08.693
That's Emory.

00:14:08.693 --> 00:14:10.386
Byron.

00:14:10.386 --> 00:14:12.248
Taylor.

00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:13.795
Elizabeth.

00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:15.872
And my great friend Sean.

00:14:15.872 --> 00:14:19.733
So we decided at that point 
to involve other organizations

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:22.975
to be part of this larger exhibition

00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:28.187
that was going to be sent out from 
the People's Genome Celebration in 2001.

00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:31.435
The National Human Genome Research 
Institute and the Genetic Alliance

00:14:31.435 --> 00:14:34.476
invited me to create an exhibition 
at the Smithsonian,

00:14:34.476 --> 00:14:36.666
commemorating the mapping 
of the human genome.

00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:39.109
So we actually invited 
other genetic support groups

00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:42.428
to be part of this exhibition, 
not just on albinism, but all groups,

00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:44.874
again illustrating 
the universal applicability.

00:14:44.874 --> 00:14:47.102
I saw these images 
from the Marfan Foundation,

00:14:47.102 --> 00:14:50.574
these kids grow very, very tall, 
at risk of an aortic dissection,

00:14:50.574 --> 00:14:52.891
but they're amazing kids,
and I thought, how gorgeous.

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.811
And I understood 
the importance of this image,

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.920
how important it was 
to show how beautiful,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.919
and to show how the image presents itself.

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:01.778
But isn't there another way to show it?

00:15:01.778 --> 00:15:03.940
Because nobody, and I've photographed 
thousands of kids now,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.022
with Marfan Syndrome,

00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:08.055
and nobody stands like this, 
with a portable black bar.

00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:10.734
It's extraordinary. 
So we decided to put them in a pool,

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:12.980
show Billy swimming --
["Bill with Marfan Syndrome"] --

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.897
show how it presents itself, 
but keep going,

00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:17.574
and keep presenting how these kids look,

00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:20.481
but put the humanity 
back in these gorgeous images.

00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:23.709
I only have a few seconds here, 
so I'm going to go through.

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:25.528
Cool girls at the Costello Conference.

00:15:25.528 --> 00:15:27.628
These are great friends 
Danielle and Maggie,

00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:29.958
who actually met 
at the last Costello Conference.

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.870
For both, the first time they ever met 
anybody with the same syndrome.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.701
They go to the same conferences 
every year and I go and photograph them.

00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:38.187
And this year, 
they were there again in Florida,

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.103
but this time it's a little different.

00:15:40.103 --> 00:15:43.299
They're gangsters now. (Laughter)
But they're pretty amazing kids.

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:47.320
I just want to talk very briefly 
about this really great kid,

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.793
to talk very briefly about a project 
that we're taking these images,

00:15:53.793 --> 00:15:55.348
and bringing them into high schools.

00:15:55.348 --> 00:15:58.068
I can photograph a great kid in my studio,

00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:01.267
and she's having a brilliant time, 
and she feels 10,000 feet tall.

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:05.282
By the time she leaves my studio 
and gets to Park Avenue,

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:07.583
five people point at her, 
point at her birthmark,

00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:10.094
or at her white hair, or her wheelchair.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:13.196
So we have to make it relevant 
for all of us, for all these kids,

00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:17.606
to make people understand what the idea 
of celebrating diversity actually means.

00:16:17.606 --> 00:16:19.512
So we started a project 
called the PEARLS Project,

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:21.986
where these photographs 
are going into high schools,

00:16:21.986 --> 00:16:24.333
and the kids that are in the images 
are blogging,

00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:26.460
and the students
are following their blogs.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.329
And they all have 
these great video intros.

00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:30.885
I just want to give you this last one, 
and this is actually Byron,

00:16:30.885 --> 00:16:32.997
who is actually one of our bloggers.

00:16:32.997 --> 00:16:34.899
(Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:37.601
I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14.

00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:39.339
When I was 10 months old,

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:42.375
I had a left hemispherectomy.

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:46.277
I had the left half of my brain removed,

00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:51.063
because I have something 
called Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:55.835
I wear a brace
on my right leg and right arm.

00:16:55.835 --> 00:16:59.394
I only see out of 
the right side of each eye,

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:06.875
so sometimes it's harder 
for me to see things on the right side.

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:13.301
So playing sports can be frustrating, 
because I might not see a ball coming.

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:22.214
I didn't see that coming. Excuse me.

00:17:22.224 --> 00:17:25.700
Rick Guidotti: So we're using 
all the visual art

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.454
to change public perceptions 
through these great kids.

00:17:28.454 --> 00:17:30.751
I feel as an artist, 
it's my responsibility.

00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:31.992
I know that when I was a kid,

00:17:31.992 --> 00:17:34.553
and I saw someone that was different 
walking down the street,

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.846
If I stared, I got slapped by my mom.

00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:40.300
So the idea was
if you don't stare, look away.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.317
And I think as an artist, 
it's my responsibility,

00:17:42.317 --> 00:17:44.004
and all of our responsibilities,

00:17:44.004 --> 00:17:46.242
to steady that gaze a little bit longer.

00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:49.543
Because you stand there, 
and you'll see a difference.

00:17:49.543 --> 00:17:51.979
You'll start seeing beauty 
in that difference.

00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:54.072
And you'll start seeing 
beautiful gorgeousness,

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:57.059
and then this light just spreads, 
and once you're enlightened,

00:17:57.059 --> 00:17:58.736
it just changes your whole world.

00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:01.186
It's about seeing 
the beauty in all differences.

00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:02.667
Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.892
Thank you guys, thank you.
