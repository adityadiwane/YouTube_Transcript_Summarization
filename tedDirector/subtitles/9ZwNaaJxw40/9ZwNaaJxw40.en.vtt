00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
far from these beautiful mountains, where the people

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is to measure their gross national happiness

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
rather than their gross national product.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And why not?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but a fundamental human right for all.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And what is happiness?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Happiness is the freedom of choice.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The freedom to chose where to live,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
what to do, what to buy, what to sell,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from whom, to whom, when and how.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Where does choice come from?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Well, one way to express choice is through the market.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for demonstrating that famine is not so much about

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or entitle oneself to that food through the market.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in my country of birth, Ethiopia.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Not because there was not enough food --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
because there was actually a surplus of food

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but because in the north, people could not access

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
or entitle themselves to that food.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That was a turning point for my life.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
compared to 40 percent in Asia.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
compared to 144 in Asia.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and therefore without much freedom.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
His livelihood is predetermined

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
by the conditions of grinding poverty.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
He comes to the market when prices are lowest,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because he has no choice.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
She comes back to the market

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the lean season -- when food is scarce --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because she has to feed her family and has no choice.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that we know exists?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
are efficient, but poor.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and profit-minded just like everybody else.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Well, we don't need, now,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that Africa is open for business.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And that business is agriculture.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This meant that governments were to remove themselves

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
from the business of buying and selling --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which they did rather inefficiently --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and let the private market do its magic.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, what happened over the last 25 years?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Did Africa feed itself?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I think we're all in this room,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
over the next 10 years,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
where the food import bill is now double

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
what it was 20 years ago,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
where food production per capita has

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The market reforms prompted by the West --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And it seems to me that the reforms might have

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
thrown the baby out with the bath water.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Like its agriculture,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We know from our work around the continent

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that transaction costs of reaching the market,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
are extremely high.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
In fact, only one third of agricultural output

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
produced in Africa even reaches the market.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
market information, grades and standards,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in narrow networks of people they know and trust.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And because of that, as grain changes hands --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
it also changes sacks.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in terms of the quantity and the product quality.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And that actually has huge implications

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and situations where there are deficits, for example.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It also has very high cost implications.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of grades and standards and market information,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
sacks have to be constantly changed.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And this leads to very high handling costs.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
trusting that they're going to have

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
some sort of demand for their produce,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and completely at the mercy of the merchants

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in the only market, the nearest local market they know --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that Africa's farmers have to bear.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that our farmers in Africa today face.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
for not only the incentives of farmers to invest

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but also direct implications for food security.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
What also happened that year

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is a tragic example of arrested development,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but happens over and over, all over Africa.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I am here to tell you that change is in the air.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that markets don't happen by themselves.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to talk about getting prices right.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
There was a very influential book about that,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
When conditions are right, we know and see

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
just like anywhere else.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
as a World Bank senior economist in Washington

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
after nearly 30 years abroad.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I did so for a simple reason.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
After having spent more than a decade

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I decided it was time to do something about it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
is not new to the world.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
for precisely the same reasons

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and send it upriver to the Chicago market.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
on the basis of which trade could be done.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and the rise of Chicago to a global market,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Now, over the last century,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of Western industrialized countries,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
products produced mainly in the south --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But that is actually changing.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And we're seeing a shift --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
powered mainly because of information technology --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges --

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
over the last three years by 270 percent a year.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the second largest commodity exchange in the world.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to Ethiopia's needs and realities,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Ethiopia's small farmers.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
We're creating a system that serves all market actors,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
we've done something rather unique, which is to

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
take the approach of an integrated perspective,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
or what we call the ECX Edge.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
in which the market will develop itself.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And this is because one of the things we've learned

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
over the last decade of studying market development in Africa

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
is that the piecemeal approach does not work.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You've got one donor trying to develop market information,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
In our approach in Ethiopia,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
or environment, in which trade takes place.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
which will initially start as an open outcry,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
an Internet cafe in the rural areas.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So that farmers and small traders

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the remote access terminal centers -- and actually,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
or any of those things, simply see the trading

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to assure that payment is done appropriately,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
in the right amount and at the right time,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Obviously, we work with exchange actors,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and as we're developing the exchange market itself,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
the overarching legal framework for making this market work.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So, in fact, our proclamation

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
is going to parliament next month.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
directly to farmers.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
What this does is transforms, fundamentally,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
the farmers' relationship to the market.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Whereas before the farmer used to think local --

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
eight to 10 kilometers away on average,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and sell whatever they happened to have,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And they start to think national, and even global.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
but also planting decisions, on the basis of information

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
coming from the futures price market.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
will achieve in terms of a price premium.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So all of this will transform farmers.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
It will also transform the way traders do business.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
to really thinking strategically about how to move grain

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Can Ethiopia do this?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
It seems very ambitious.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
But it will create new opportunities.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
We believe that this initiative requires great political will,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and really even the underlying legal framework.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
which starts in about eight months.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
The last parliament of our century opened with our president

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
announcing to the country that this was the most important

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
economic initiative for the country today.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
We believe that the stakes are high,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
but that the returns will be even greater.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
in agricultural commodities.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And we feel that over the next five years,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
than South Africa's grain production,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So the potential is there.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
The will is there.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
The commitment is there.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
and to change Africa.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
(Applause)
