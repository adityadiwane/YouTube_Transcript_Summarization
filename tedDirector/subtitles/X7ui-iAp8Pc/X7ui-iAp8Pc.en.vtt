00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
My name is Kate Hartman.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I like to make devices

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
that play with the ways

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
that we relate and communicate.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
relate to ourselves, each other

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and the world around us.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
(Laughter)

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So just to give you a bit of context,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I teach courses in physical computing

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and wearable electronics.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And much of what I do is either wearable

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
or somehow related to the human form.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And so anytime I talk about what I do,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I like to just quickly address

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
the reason why bodies matter.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And it's pretty simple.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Everybody's got one -- all of you.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I can guarantee, everyone in this room,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
the people up top with the laptops --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
we all have bodies.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Don't be ashamed.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
It's something that we have in common

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
And so when working as an interaction designer,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
or as an artist who deals with participation --

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.260
creating things that live on, in or around the human form --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
it's really a powerful space to work within.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
So within my own work,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I use a broad range of materials and tools.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
to funnels and plastic tubing.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
the easiest place to start the story

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
is with a hat.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
And so it all started several years ago,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and I was thinking.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And so I was thinking about how it might be great

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
if I could just take all these noises --

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head --

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
if I could just physically extricate them

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and pull them out in such a form

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that I could share them with somebody else.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And I called it the Muttering Hat,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
because it emitted these muttering noises

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
that were kind of tethered to you,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
but you could detach them

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and share them with somebody else.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.260
(Laughter)

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
So I make other hats as well.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
(Laughter)

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It's fairly self-explanatory.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.260
It physically carves out conversation space for one.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
And when you speak out loud,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
(Laughter)

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And so when I make these things,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
it's really not so much about the object itself,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
but rather the negative space around the object.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
What kind of an experience do they have?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And how are they transformed by wearing it?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
So many of these devices

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And it is a tool

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
that actually enables one

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
to listen to their own innards.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.260
(Laughter)

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And so some of these things

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
are actually more geared toward expression and communication.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And so the Inflatable Heart

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
is an external organ

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
according to their emotions.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So they can express everything from admiration and lust

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
to anxiety and angst.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
(Laughter)

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
And some of these are actually meant

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
to mediate experiences.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
(Laughter)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
but is serves to absorb

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
the specificity of the words that are delivered.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.260
(Laughter)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And in the end,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
some of these things just act as invitations.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
so someone can grab your ear

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
and say what they have to say.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
between people,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I also consider the ways

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
in which we relate to the world around us.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
I was thinking a lot about

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and how I would like to better relate to them.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
And I thought, "Well, hey!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
So I made a wearable wall

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
that I could wear as a backpack.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
And so I would put it on

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and sort of physically transform myself

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
so that I could either contribute to or critique

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the spaces that surrounded me.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
(Laughter)

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And so jumping off of that,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
which actually enables houseplants

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to tap into human communication protocols.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
So when a plant is thirsty,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
it can actually make a phone call

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
or post a message to a service like Twitter.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
because a single house plant

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
can actually express its needs

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
to thousands of people at the same time.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And so kind of thinking about scale,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
my most recent obsession

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.260
is actually with glaciers -- of course.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
but what I'm particularly interested in

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
is in human-glacier relations.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
(Laughter)

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Because there seems to be an issue.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
The glaciers are actually leaving us.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
They're both shrinking and retreating --

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and some of them have disappeared altogether.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And so I actually live in Canada now,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And this one's particularly interesting,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
because, of all the glaciers in North America,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And this has really gotten me thinking

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
about this experience of the initial encounter.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.260
When I meet a glacier for the very first time,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
what do I do?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260
There's no kind of social protocol for this.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
I really just don't even know

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
how to say hello.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Do I carve a message in the snow?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
Or perhaps I can assemble one

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
out of dot and dash ice cubes --

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
ice cube Morse code.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
like an icy megaphone

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
that I can use to amplify my voice

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
when I direct it at the ice.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But really the most satisfying experience I've had

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
is the act of listening,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
which is what we need in any good relationship.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
This very basic shift in my physical orientation

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
helped me shift my perspective

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
in relation to the glacier.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
And so since we use devices

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.260
to figure out how to relate to the world these days,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
(Laughter)

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that serves to mediate the difference in temperature

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
between the human body and the glacial ice.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And once again, it's this invitation

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.260
that asks people to lay down on the glacier

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and give it a hug.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
These are initial musings for this project.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
And so my intent

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.260
is to actually just take the next 10 years

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.260
and go on a series of collaborative projects

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
where I work with people from different disciplines --

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
artists, technologists, scientists --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
to kind of work on this project

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
of how we can improve human-glacier relations.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
So beyond that, in closing,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I'd just like to say that we're in this era

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
of communications and device proliferation,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
but I think what's really important

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
is thinking about how we can simultaneously

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Thanks.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:59.260
(Applause)
