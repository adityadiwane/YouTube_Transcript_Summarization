00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.811
I want to talk about my investigations

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:23.379
into what technology means in our lives --

00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:26.611
not just our immediate life,
but in the cosmic sense,

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:29.777
in the kind of long history of the world

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.380
and our place in the world.

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:34.278
What is this stuff?

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:35.762
What is the significance?

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:39.694
And so, I want to kind of
go through my little story

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:40.964
of what I found out.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:43.275
One of the first things
I started to investigate

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.110
was the history of the name of technology.

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:49.088
In the United States,
there is a State of the Union address

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:52.007
given by every president since 1790.

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:57.069
And each one of those is kind of
summing up the most important things

00:00:57.093 --> 00:00:58.799
for the United States at that time.

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:04.109
If you search for the word "technology,"
it was not used until 1952.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:08.231
So, technology was sort of absent
from everybody's thinking until 1952,

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.306
which happened to be the year of my birth.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.323
And obviously, technology
had existed before then,

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:14.752
but we weren't aware of it.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:19.374
And so it was sort of an awakening
of this force in our life.

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.611
I actually did research to find out
the first use of the word "technology."

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:25.611
It was in 1829,

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:28.611
and it was invented by a guy
who was starting a curriculum --

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:33.261
a course, bringing together all the kinds
of arts and crafts, and industry --

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.246
and he called it "Technology."

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.753
And that's the very first use of the word.

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:39.943
So what is this stuff

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:43.767
that we're all consumed by
and bothered by?

00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:48.200
Alan Kay calls it, "Technology
is anything that was invented

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:49.453
after you were born."

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:50.485
(Laughter)

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.944
Which is sort of the idea we normally
have about what technology is:

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:56.611
it's all that new stuff.

00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:58.838
It's not roads, or penicillin,

00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:02.625
or factory tires; it's the new stuff.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.172
My friend Danny Hillis
says kind of a similar one,

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:07.875
he says, "Technology is anything
that doesn't work yet."

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:08.914
(Laughter)

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:10.978
Which is, again,
a sense that it's all new.

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:12.710
But we know that it's just not new.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.020
It actually goes way back,

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:18.145
and what I want to suggest is,
it goes a long way back.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.937
So, another way to think
about technology, what it means,

00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:22.985
is to imagine a world without technology.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.670
If we were to eliminate every single bit
of technology in the world today --

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:31.611
and I mean everything,
from blades to scrapers to cloth --

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:34.370
we, as a species,
would not live very long.

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:37.371
We would die by the billions,
and very quickly:

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:40.700
the wolves would get us,
we would be defenseless,

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:43.917
we would be unable to grow
enough food or find enough food.

00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:47.377
Even the hunter-gatherers
used some elementary tools.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.733
So, they had minimal technology,

00:02:49.757 --> 00:02:51.439
but they had some technology.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.596
And if we study
those hunter-gatherer tribes

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.272
and the Neanderthal,
which are very similar to early man,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:01.583
we find out a very curious thing
about this world without technology,

00:03:01.607 --> 00:03:04.436
and this is a kind of a curve
of their average age.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.915
There are no Neanderthal fossils
that are older than 40 years old

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.550
that we've ever found,

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:14.804
and the average age of most of these
hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:19.729
There are very few young infants,
because they die -- high mortality rate --

00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:21.301
and there's very few old people.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:24.905
So the profile is sort of for your average
San Francisco neighborhood:

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.334
a lot of young people.

00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:29.422
And if you go there, you say,
"Hey, everybody's really healthy."

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.350
Well, that's because they're all young.

00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.105
Same thing with the hunter-gatherer
tribes and early man:

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.924
you didn't live beyond the age of 30.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:37.925
So it was a world without grandparents.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.982
And grandparents are very important,

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:43.645
because they are the transmitter
of cultural evolution and information.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.805
Imagine a world where basically
everybody was 20 to 30 years old.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.473
How much learning can you do?

00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:50.832
You can't do very much
learning in your own life,

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.154
it's so short,

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.532
and there's nobody to pass on
what you do learn.

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:57.503
So that's one aspect.

00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.843
It was a very short life.

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:01.659
But at the same time, anthropologists know

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:04.263
that most hunter-gatherer
tribes of the world,

00:04:04.287 --> 00:04:05.949
with that very little technology,

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:09.459
actually did not spend a very long time
gathering the food they needed:

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:11.066
three to six hours a day.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.111
Some anthropologists call that
the original affluent society,

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:17.501
because they had
bankers' hours, basically.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:20.159
So it was possible to get enough food.

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:22.684
But when the scarcity came,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.991
when the highs and lows
and the droughts came,

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.548
then people went into starvation.

00:04:27.572 --> 00:04:29.620
And that's why they didn't live very long.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.059
So what technology brought,

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:35.532
through the very simple tools
like these stone tools here --

00:04:36.683 --> 00:04:38.496
even something as small as this --

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.925
the early bands of humans were actually
able to eliminate to extinction

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.041
about 250 megafauna animals
in North America

00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:51.254
when they first arrived 10,000 years ago.

00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:53.919
So, long before the industrial age,

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:56.611
we've been affecting
the planet on a global scale

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:58.766
with just a small amount of technology.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.086
The other thing that the early man
invented was fire.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.235
And fire was used to clear out, and again,

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.907
affected the ecology of grass
and whole continents,

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.329
and was used in cooking.

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:12.808
It enabled us to actually
eat all kinds of things.

00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:15.086
It was, in a certain sense,
in a McLuhan sense,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.218
an external stomach,

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:20.737
in the sense that it was cooking food
that we could not eat otherwise.

00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:23.505
And if we didn't have fire,
we actually could not live.

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.671
Our bodies have adapted
to these new diets.

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:29.490
Our bodies have changed
in the last 10,000 years.

00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:32.570
So, with that little bit of technology,

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:34.870
humans went from a small band
of 10,000 or so --

00:05:34.894 --> 00:05:37.043
the same number
as Neanderthals everywhere --

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:38.305
and we suddenly exploded.

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.930
With the invention of language
around 50,000 years ago,

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:42.447
the number of humans exploded,

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.595
and very quickly became
the dominant species on the planet.

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:48.061
And they migrated
into the rest of the world

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:49.525
at two kilometers per year

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.526
until, within several tens
of thousands of years,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.825
we occupied every single
watershed on the planet

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.667
and became the most dominant species,

00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:59.054
with a very small amount of technology.

00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:02.158
And even at that time,
with the introduction of agriculture,

00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:03.892
8,000, 10,000 years ago,

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.611
we started to see climate change.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:09.219
So climate change is not a new thing;
what's new is just the degree of it.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.318
Even during the agricultural age,
there was climate change.

00:06:12.342 --> 00:06:16.078
So already, small amounts of technology
were transforming the world.

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.763
And what this means, and where I'm going,

00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:22.611
is that technology has become
the most powerful force in the world.

00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:25.562
All the things we see today
that are changing our lives,

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.773
we can always trace back

00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:28.862
to the introduction
of some new technology.

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:30.191
So it's a force,

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:34.286
that is the most powerful force
that has been unleashed on this planet,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.119
and in such a degree,

00:06:36.143 --> 00:06:42.364
that I think it's become who we are.

00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:45.643
In fact, our humanity and everything
that we think about ourselves,

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:47.135
is something we've invented.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.566
So we've invented ourselves.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.708
Of all the animals
that we've domesticated,

00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:52.847
the most important animal has been us.

00:06:54.093 --> 00:06:57.611
So humanity is our greatest invention,

00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:59.611
but of course, we're not done yet.

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:00.797
We're still inventing,

00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.159
and this is what technology
is allowing us to do;

00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:05.219
it's continually to reinvent ourselves.

00:07:05.243 --> 00:07:07.666
It's a very, very strong force.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.825
I call this entire thing --
us humans as our technology,

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.611
everything that we've made,
gadgets in our lives --

00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:14.898
we call that the technium.

00:07:14.922 --> 00:07:16.082
That's this world.

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:18.011
My working definition of technology is:

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.408
anything useful that a human mind makes.

00:07:20.432 --> 00:07:23.090
It's not just hammers
and gadgets, like laptops.

00:07:23.114 --> 00:07:24.535
But it's also law.

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:29.702
And, of course, cities are ways
to make things more useful to us.

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:32.191
While this is something
that comes from our mind,

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:36.508
it also has its roots
deeply into the cosmos.

00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:37.695
It goes back.

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.582
The origins and roots of technology
go back to the Big Bang,

00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:45.094
in this way, in that they are part
of this self-organizing thread

00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:49.673
that starts at the Big Bang
and goes through galaxies and stars,

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:51.255
into life, into us.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.907
And the three major phases
of the early universe

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.153
was energy, when the dominant
force was energy;

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:59.217
then the dominant force,
as it cooled, became matter;

00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.611
and then, with the invention
of life four billion years ago,

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:05.421
the dominant force in our neighborhood
became information.

00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:06.629
That's what life is:

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.813
an information process
that was restructuring

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:10.059
and making new order.

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:13.700
So, energy and matter,
Einstein showed were equivalent,

00:08:13.724 --> 00:08:19.344
and now new sciences of quantum computing
show that entropy and information

00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:20.818
and matter and energy

00:08:20.842 --> 00:08:22.006
are all interrelated.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.567
So it's one long continuum.

00:08:24.464 --> 00:08:27.659
You put energy
into the right kind of system,

00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.757
and out comes wasted heat, entropy,

00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:33.611
and extropy, which is order.

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:34.965
It's the increased order.

00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:36.542
Where does this order come from?

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:37.837
Its roots go way back.

00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:39.194
We actually don't know.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.430
But we do know

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:44.749
that the self-organization trend
throughout the universe is long,

00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:46.996
and it began with things like galaxies;

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.514
they maintained their order
for billions of years.

00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:53.388
Stars are basically
nuclear fission machines

00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:56.711
that self-organize and self-sustain
themselves for billions of years:

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.866
order against the extropy of the world.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.800
And flowers and plants
are the same thing, extended,

00:09:03.824 --> 00:09:08.571
and technology is basically
an extension of life.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:12.461
One trend that we notice
in all those things

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:15.057
is that the amount of energy
per gram per second

00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:16.364
that flows through this

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:17.679
is actually increasing.

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:22.282
The amount of energy is increasing
through this little sequence.

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:26.283
And the amount of energy per gram
per second that flows through life

00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:28.284
is actually greater than a star --

00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:31.611
because of the star's long lifespan,

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.824
the energy density in life
is actually higher than a star.

00:09:34.848 --> 00:09:37.707
And the energy density
that we see in the greatest amount

00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:38.937
anywhere in the universe

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.294
is actually in a PC chip.

00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:43.468
There is more energy flowing
through, per gram per second,

00:09:43.492 --> 00:09:46.610
than anything that we have
any other experience with.

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:48.263
And so, what I would suggest

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:51.228
is that if you want to see
where technology is going,

00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:52.884
we continue that trajectory,

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:55.761
and we say, "Well, it's going
to become more energy-dense,

00:09:55.785 --> 00:09:57.002
that's where it's going."

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:59.994
And so what I've done is,
I've taken the same kinds of things

00:10:00.018 --> 00:10:03.284
and looked at other aspects
of evolutionary life and say,

00:10:03.308 --> 00:10:05.914
"What are the general trends
in evolutionary life?"

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.660
And there are things moving
towards greater complexity,

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:12.611
moving towards greater diversity,
moving towards greater specialization,

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:16.877
sentience, ubiquity,
and most important, evolvability.

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:20.424
Those very same things
are also present in technology.

00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:22.297
That's where technology is going.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.764
In fact, technology
is accelerating all the aspects of life.

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:29.133
And we can see that happening;

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:33.308
just as there's diversity in life,
there's more diversity in things we make.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.482
Things in life start off
being general cells,

00:10:35.506 --> 00:10:36.887
and they become specialized:

00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:39.048
you have tissue cells,
muscle, brain cells.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:41.102
The same thing happens
with, say, a hammer,

00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:43.611
which is general at first
and becomes more specific.

00:10:43.635 --> 00:10:46.731
So I would like to say
that while there are six kingdoms of life,

00:10:46.755 --> 00:10:50.336
we can think of technology
basically as a seventh kingdom of life.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.691
It's a branching off from the human form.

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:56.611
But technology has its own agenda,
like anything, like life itself.

00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:59.777
For instance, right now,
three-quarters of the energy that we use

00:10:59.801 --> 00:11:01.933
is actually used to feed
the technium itself.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:03.849
In transportation, it's not to move us;

00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:05.742
it's to move the stuff we make or buy.

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.743
I use the word "want." Technology wants.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.769
This is a robot that wants to plug
itself in to get more power.

00:11:10.793 --> 00:11:13.372
Your cat wants more food.

00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:15.959
A bacterium, which has
no consciousness at all,

00:11:15.983 --> 00:11:17.611
wants to move towards light.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.323
It has an urge,
and technology has an urge.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.491
At the same time,
it wants to give us things,

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.069
and what it gives us
is basically progress.

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:28.165
You can take all kinds of curves,
and they're all pointing up.

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:30.611
There's really no dispute about progress,

00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:33.611
if we discount the cost of that.

00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:35.826
And that's the thing
that bothers most people,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.714
is that progress is really real,
but we wonder and question:

00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:41.611
What are the environmental costs of it?

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:45.462
I did a survey of the number
of species of artifacts in my house,

00:11:45.486 --> 00:11:46.644
and there's 6,000.

00:11:46.668 --> 00:11:48.737
Other people have come up with 10,000.

00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:51.201
When King Henry of England died,

00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:53.279
he had 18,000 things in his house,

00:11:53.303 --> 00:11:56.780
but that was the entire
wealth of England, so ...

00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:58.014
(Laughter)

00:11:58.038 --> 00:12:00.544
And with that entire wealth of England,

00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:03.494
King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,

00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:05.068
he could not buy refrigeration,

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:07.225
he could not buy
a trip of a thousand miles,

00:12:07.249 --> 00:12:11.713
whereas this rickshaw wallah in India
could save up and buy antibiotics

00:12:11.737 --> 00:12:13.480
and he could buy refrigeration.

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:16.975
He could buy things that King Henry,
in all his wealth, could never buy.

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.666
That's what progress is about.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.611
So, technology is selfish;
technology is generous.

00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:24.831
That conflict, that tension,
will be with us forever:

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:27.053
sometimes it wants to do
what it wants to do,

00:12:27.077 --> 00:12:29.197
and sometimes it's going
to do things for us.

00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:31.288
We have confusion
about what we should think

00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:32.611
about a new technology.

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:36.465
Right now the default position
when a new technology comes along,

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:38.814
is people talk about
the precautionary principle,

00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:40.724
which is very common in Europe,

00:12:40.748 --> 00:12:42.795
which says, basically, "Don't do anything.

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:45.433
When you meet a new technology, stop,

00:12:45.457 --> 00:12:47.986
until it can be proven
that it does no harm."

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.255
I think that really leads nowhere.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:53.280
But a better way is
what I call the proactionary principle,

00:12:53.304 --> 00:12:55.710
which is, you engage with technology.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.112
You try it out.

00:12:57.136 --> 00:13:01.352
You obviously do what the precautionary
principle suggests,

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:02.621
you try to anticipate it,

00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:04.072
but after anticipating it,

00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:05.611
you constantly asses it,

00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:07.198
not just once, but eternally.

00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:10.399
And when it diverts from what you want,

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:13.584
we prioritize risk,
we evaluate not just the new stuff,

00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:14.767
but the old stuff.

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:16.661
We fix it; but most importantly,

00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:17.842
we relocate it.

00:13:17.866 --> 00:13:19.690
And what I mean by that is,

00:13:19.714 --> 00:13:21.422
we find a new job for it.

00:13:21.446 --> 00:13:25.456
Nuclear energy, fission,
is a really bad idea for bombs.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.875
But it may be a pretty good idea
relocated into sustainable nuclear energy

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:33.217
for electricity, instead of burning coal.

00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:34.956
When we have a bad idea,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.544
the response to a bad idea

00:13:36.568 --> 00:13:39.888
is not no ideas,
it's not to stop thinking.

00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:42.065
The response to a bad idea --

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.217
like, say, a tungsten lightbulb --

00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:46.480
is a better idea.

00:13:46.973 --> 00:13:50.453
So, better ideas
is really always the response

00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:51.842
to technology we don't like;

00:13:51.866 --> 00:13:53.953
it's basically better technology.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.279
And actually, in a certain sense,
technology is a kind of a method

00:13:58.303 --> 00:13:59.858
for generating better ideas,

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:01.611
if you can think about it that way.

00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:04.730
So, maybe spraying DDT
on crops is a really bad idea.

00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:07.611
But DDT sprayed on local homes --

00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:10.611
there's nothing better
to eliminate malaria,

00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:14.373
besides insect DDT-impregnated
mosquito nets.

00:14:14.397 --> 00:14:17.728
But that's a really good idea;
that's a good job for technology.

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:21.611
So our job as humans
is to parent our mind children,

00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:23.079
to find them good friends,

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:24.495
to find them a good job.

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.327
And so, every technology
is sort of a creative force

00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:29.371
looking for the right job.

00:14:29.395 --> 00:14:31.486
That's actually my son, right here.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.833
(Laughter)

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:35.349
There are no bad technologies,

00:14:35.373 --> 00:14:37.069
just as there are no bad children.

00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:39.975
We don't say children are neutral;
children are positive.

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:42.326
We just have to find them the right place.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.304
And so, what technology gives us
over the long term --

00:14:46.328 --> 00:14:49.969
over this sort of extended evolution
from the beginning of time,

00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:53.611
through the invention
of the plants and animals,

00:14:53.635 --> 00:14:56.611
and the evolution of life,
the evolution of brains --

00:14:56.635 --> 00:15:00.546
what that is constantly giving us
is increasing differences:

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.025
It's increasing diversity,
it's increasing options,

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:07.027
it's increasing choices, opportunities,
possibilities and freedoms.

00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:09.975
That's what we get
from technology all the time.

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:12.815
That's why people leave villages
and go into cities --

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:16.488
because they are always gravitating
towards increased choices

00:15:16.512 --> 00:15:17.749
and possibilities.

00:15:17.773 --> 00:15:20.402
And we are aware of the price;

00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:22.665
we pay a price for that,
but we're aware of it,

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:25.644
and generally, we will pay the price
for increased freedoms,

00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:27.056
choices and opportunities.

00:15:27.565 --> 00:15:30.273
Even technology wants clean water.

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:34.478
Is technology diametrically
opposed to nature?

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:37.360
Because technology
is an extension of life,

00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:40.227
it's in parallel and aligned
with the same things

00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:41.554
that life wants.

00:15:42.134 --> 00:15:44.309
So that I think technology loves biology,

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:45.884
if we allow it to.

00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:50.611
Great movement
starting billions of years ago

00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:52.939
is moving through us
and it continues to go,

00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:56.376
and our choice, so to speak,
in technology,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.471
is really to align ourselves
with this force

00:15:58.495 --> 00:15:59.879
much greater than ourselves.

00:15:59.903 --> 00:16:02.711
So, technology is more
than just the stuff in your pocket;

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:04.126
it's more than just gadgets,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.615
it's more than just things
that people invent.

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:10.026
It's actually part of a very long
story -- a great story --

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.683
that began billions of years ago.

00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:14.014
It's moving through us,
this self-organization,

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:16.015
and we're extending and accelerating it,

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:19.803
and we can be part of it by aligning
the technology that we make with it.

00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:22.665
And I really appreciate
your attention today.

00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:23.848
Thank you.

00:16:23.872 --> 00:16:27.458
(Applause)
