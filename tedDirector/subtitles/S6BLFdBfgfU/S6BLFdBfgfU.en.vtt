00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.260
The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
We've known about fusion since 1920,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
conjectured that that's why the sun shines.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I've always been very worried about resource.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I don't know about you, but

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
when my mother gave me food,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I always sorted the ones I disliked

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
from the ones I liked.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And I ate the disliked ones first,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.260
because the ones you like, you want to save.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And as a child you're always worried about resource.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And once it was sort of explained to me

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.260
how fast we were using up the world's resources,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
I got very upset,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
about as upset as I did when I realized

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
that the Earth will only last about five billion years

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
before it's swallowed by the sun.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Big events in my life,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
a strange child.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.260
(Laughter)

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
have something underneath them.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
oil, gas, sorry.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
(Laughter)

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Gas, I'm probably the only person

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
who really enjoys it when Mister Putin

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
We're really dominated now

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.260
by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in the Third World, in the developing world,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
we're using energy faster and faster.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
And those resources are going away.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And the way we'll make energy in the future

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
is not from resource,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
it's really from knowledge.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
If you look 50 years into the future,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
the way we probably will be making energy

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
is probably one of these three,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
with some wind, with some other things,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.260
the base load energy supply for the world.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
Fission.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.260
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and probably more after that.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Because they know that that is one sure way

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
to do carbon-free energy.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
the perfect energy source is one

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
that doesn't take up much space,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
has a virtually inexhaustible supply,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.260
doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
it's fusion.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
Fusion is very hard to do.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We've been trying for 50 years.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
(Laughter)

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I was a strange child.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It's a medium-sized nucleus.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.260
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
But small atoms want to join together,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
small nuclei want to join together

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to make bigger ones to go towards iron.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And you can get energy out this way.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.260
In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
and then helium together to make carbon,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
are made in the middle of stars.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
But it's a hard process to do

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
almost by definition.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And there is one reaction

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.260
that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
which you can get from seawater,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And you push them together and they repel.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
But when you get them close enough,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
something called the strong force starts to act

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and pulls them together.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
So, most of the time they repel.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
the strong force grips them together.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
For a moment they become helium 5,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
because they've got five particles inside them.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
makes helium 5.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and lots of energy comes out.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
things will be rattling around so fast

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.260
that every time they collide in just the right configuration,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
this will happen, and it will release energy.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.260
And that energy is what powers fusion.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
And it's this reaction that we want to do.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
There is one trickiness about this reaction.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
It's pretty hot.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
The trickiness about the reaction is that

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
tritium doesn't exist in nature.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
You have to make it from something else.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.260
that's lithium 6, plus a neutron,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
will give you more helium, plus tritium.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And that's the way you make your tritium.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Now, why the hell would we bother to do this?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
This is basically why we would bother to do it.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.260
If you just plot how much fuel

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
we've got left, in units of

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
present world consumption.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
And as you go across there you see

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
is the lowest estimate of existing resources.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
And as you go across there you will see

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
of fossil fuels left.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And then we get to uranium.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And with current reactor technology

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
we really don't have very much uranium.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
which is the yellow line,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to make conventional nuclear power stations

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
actually do very much for us.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and do all those kind of things.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The big thing, on the right,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
is the lithium we have in the world.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Is it cost-competitive?

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
We make estimates of what we think it would cost

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
to actually make a fusion power plant.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And we get within about the same price

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
as current electricity.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
So, how would we make it?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And, in fact, we've done this.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
We hold it with a magnetic field.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
right in the middle is 150 million degrees.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And in fact we can make fusion happen.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And just down the road, this is JET.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
We can do fusion. In the center of this device

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and break all those records.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
This is the device we're building now.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
It gets very expensive to do this research.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Seven nations are involved in building this.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
But that's not electricity yet.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
We have to get to this.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
We have to get to a power plant.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
We have to start putting electricity on the grid

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
in this very complex technology.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.260
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
I wish this were different. We really need it now.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
We're going to have a problem with power

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
in the next five years in this country.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.260
So 2030 looks like an infinity away.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
get fusion to happen.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
But this is what we're aiming at,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
sometime in the 2030s --

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
