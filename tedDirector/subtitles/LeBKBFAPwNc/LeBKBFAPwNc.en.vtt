00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.539
I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.899
I soared through the galaxy

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.635
driving a huge starship

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.034
with a crew made up of people

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:26.970
from all over this world,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.420
many different races, many different cultures,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.264
many different heritages,

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.221
all working together,

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.866
and our mission was to explore strange new worlds,

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.742
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:46.705
to boldly go where no one has gone before.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.190
Well â€”

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.654
(Applause) â€”

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:59.561
I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.692
who went to America,

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:05.177
boldly going to a strange new world,

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:08.013
seeking new opportunities.

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:11.499
My mother was born in Sacramento, California.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.940
My father was a San Franciscan.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.685
They met and married in Los Angeles,

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:20.406
and I was born there.

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:22.659
I was four years old

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.489
when Pearl Harbor was bombed

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:29.231
on December 7, 1941 by Japan,

00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:33.240
and overnight, the world was plunged

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.674
into a world war.

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:39.627
America suddenly was swept up

00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:43.551
by hysteria.

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:45.025
Japanese-Americans,

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:48.185
American citizens of Japanese ancestry,

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:49.520
were looked on

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.542
with suspicion and fear

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:56.514
and with outright hatred

00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:59.174
simply because we happened to look like

00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:01.870
the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.340
And the hysteria grew and grew

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.930
until in February 1942,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.074
the president of the United States,

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:13.244
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:15.917
ordered all Japanese-Americans

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:18.026
on the West Coast of America

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:20.942
to be summarily rounded up

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.147
with no charges, with no trial,

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:26.574
with no due process.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.165
Due process, this is a core pillar

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:30.778
of our justice system.

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:33.207
That all disappeared.

00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:35.306
We were to be rounded up

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:39.567
and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:43.759
in some of the most desolate places in America:

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.186
the blistering hot desert of Arizona,

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:50.651
the sultry swamps of Arkansas,

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.344
the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,

00:02:54.344 --> 00:02:59.778
and two of the most desolate places in California.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:04.546
On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:08.163
and just a few weeks after my birthday,

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.934
my parents got my younger brother,

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:12.992
my baby sister and me

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.021
up very early one morning,

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:18.246
and they dressed us hurriedly.

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:20.240
My brother and I were in the living room

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.303
looking out the front window,

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:27.147
and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:31.669
They carried bayonets on their rifles.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.470
They stomped up the front porch

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.989
and banged on the door.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.094
My father answered it,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:43.835
and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:46.160
My father gave my brother and me

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.902
small luggages to carry,

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:51.418
and we walked out and stood on the driveway

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.413
waiting for our mother to come out,

00:03:54.413 --> 00:03:57.728
and when my mother finally came out,

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:00.791
she had our baby sister in one arm,

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.163
a huge duffel bag in the other,

00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:09.305
and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:13.092
I will never be able to forget that scene.

00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:17.440
It is burned into my memory.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.231
We were taken from our home

00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.749
and loaded on to train cars

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.759
with other Japanese-American families.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.239
There were guards stationed

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:30.699
at both ends of each car,

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.398
as if we were criminals.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.555
We were taken two thirds of
the way across the country,

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:41.767
rocking on that train for four days and three nights,

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:45.502
to the swamps of Arkansas.

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:47.515
I still remember the barbed wire fence

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:50.125
that confined me.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.712
I remember the tall sentry tower

00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:56.965
with the machine guns pointed at us.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:59.654
I remember the searchlight that followed me

00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:01.093
when I made the night runs

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:04.344
from my barrack to the latrine.

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:06.504
But to five-year-old me,

00:05:06.504 --> 00:05:08.800
I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.054
for me to pee.

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:13.947
I was a child,

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:16.572
too young to understand the circumstances

00:05:16.572 --> 00:05:19.003
of my being there.

00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:23.769
Children are amazingly adaptable.

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:27.326
What would be grotesquely abnormal

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.180
became my normality

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.794
in the prisoner of war camps.

00:05:33.794 --> 00:05:37.484
It became routine for me to line up three times a day

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:42.231
to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.

00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:44.436
It became normal for me to go with my father

00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:47.384
to bathe in a mass shower.

00:05:47.384 --> 00:05:51.645
Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,

00:05:51.645 --> 00:05:55.269
became my normality.

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:56.910
When the war ended,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.962
we were released,

00:05:58.962 --> 00:06:00.968
and given a one-way ticket

00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:04.534
to anywhere in the United States.

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:06.435
My parents decided to go back home

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.003
to Los Angeles,

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:13.384
but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.

00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:14.780
We were penniless.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.256
Everything had been taken from us,

00:06:17.256 --> 00:06:19.689
and the hostility was intense.

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.540
Our first home was on Skid Row

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.493
in the lowest part of our city,

00:06:27.493 --> 00:06:30.060
living with derelicts, drunkards

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.080
and crazy people,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.674
the stench of urine all over,

00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:37.787
on the street, in the alley,

00:06:37.787 --> 00:06:40.108
in the hallway.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.810
It was a horrible experience,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.226
and for us kids, it was terrorizing.

00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:48.738
I remember once

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:51.690
a drunkard came staggering down,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.207
fell down right in front of us,

00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:55.857
and threw up.

00:06:55.857 --> 00:07:01.174
My baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,"

00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:03.480
because behind barbed wires

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.096
was for us

00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:08.939
home.

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.590
My parents worked hard

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.547
to get back on their feet.

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:13.666
We had lost everything.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.170
They were at the middle of their lives

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.805
and starting all over.

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.354
They worked their fingers to the bone,

00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:23.632
and ultimately they were able

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:26.120
to get the capital together to buy

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.285
a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.876
And I was a teenager,

00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:32.670
and I became very curious

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.940
about my childhood imprisonment.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.980
I had read civics books that told me about

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.691
the ideals of American democracy.

00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:45.356
All men are created equal,

00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:48.267
we have an inalienable right

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:53.206
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.440
and I couldn't quite make that fit

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.829
with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.910
I read history books,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.781
and I couldn't find anything about it.

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:07.685
And so I engaged my father after dinner

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:12.245
in long, sometimes heated conversations.

00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:15.013
We had many, many conversations like that,

00:08:15.013 --> 00:08:17.792
and what I got from them

00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:19.982
was my father's wisdom.

00:08:19.982 --> 00:08:22.294
He was the one that suffered the most

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:25.760
under those conditions of imprisonment,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.737
and yet he understood American democracy.

00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:32.464
He told me that our democracy

00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:34.571
is a people's democracy,

00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:37.630
and it can be as great as the people can be,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.821
but it is also as fallible as people are.

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.081
He told me that American democracy

00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:49.077
is vitally dependent on good people

00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:53.048
who cherish the ideals of our system

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:56.548
and actively engage in the process

00:08:56.548 --> 00:08:59.278
of making our democracy work.

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:03.343
And he took me to a campaign headquarters â€”

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:07.134
the governor of Illinois was
running for the presidency â€”

00:09:07.134 --> 00:09:11.822
and introduced me to American electoral politics.

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:14.183
And he also told me about

00:09:14.183 --> 00:09:15.961
young Japanese-Americans

00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.021
during the Second World War.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:21.825
When Pearl Harbor was bombed,

00:09:21.825 --> 00:09:24.806
young Japanese-Americans,
like all young Americans,

00:09:24.806 --> 00:09:27.304
rushed to their draft board

00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:30.712
to volunteer to fight for our country.

00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:33.144
That act of patriotism

00:09:33.144 --> 00:09:37.462
was answered with a slap in the face.

00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:40.466
We were denied service,

00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:46.328
and categorized as enemy non-alien.

00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:49.372
It was outrageous to be called an enemy

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:52.590
when you're volunteering to fight for your country,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.960
but that was compounded with the word "non-alien,"

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.070
which is a word that means

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.111
"citizen" in the negative.

00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:07.761
They even took the word "citizen" away from us,

00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:12.389
and imprisoned them for a whole year.

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:14.377
And then the government realized

00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:18.747
that there's a wartime manpower shortage,

00:10:18.747 --> 00:10:23.126
and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,

00:10:23.126 --> 00:10:25.253
they opened up the military for service

00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:28.171
by young Japanese-Americans.

00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:30.838
It was totally irrational,

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:33.072
but the amazing thing,

00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:35.429
the astounding thing,

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:37.382
is that thousands of young

00:10:37.382 --> 00:10:40.340
Japanese-American men and women

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.303
again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,

00:10:44.303 --> 00:10:47.760
put on the same uniform as that of our guards,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.288
leaving their families in imprisonment,

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:53.602
to fight for this country.

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:55.563
They said that they were going to fight

00:10:55.563 --> 00:10:58.829
not only to get their families out

00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:01.387
from behind those barbed-wire fences,

00:11:01.387 --> 00:11:04.617
but because they cherished the very ideal

00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:06.840
of what our government stands for,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.731
should stand for,

00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.232
and that was being abrogated

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:15.145
by what was being done.

00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:17.479
All men are created equal.

00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:21.300
And they went to fight for this country.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.980
They were put into a segregated

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.202
all Japanese-American unit

00:11:25.202 --> 00:11:27.826
and sent to the battlefields of Europe,

00:11:27.826 --> 00:11:30.897
and they threw themselves into it.

00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:33.742
They fought with amazing,

00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:37.200
incredible courage and valor.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.962
They were sent out on the most dangerous missions

00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:43.843
and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate

00:11:43.843 --> 00:11:47.649
of any unit proportionally.

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:50.944
There is one battle that illustrates that.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:53.988
It was a battle for the Gothic Line.

00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:56.290
The Germans were embedded

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.877
in this mountain hillside,

00:11:58.877 --> 00:12:00.449
rocky hillside,

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:02.929
in impregnable caves,

00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:06.200
and three allied battalions

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.978
had been pounding away at it

00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.462
for six months,

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.892
and they were stalemated.

00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:14.786
The 442nd was called in

00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:18.108
to add to the fight,

00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:20.274
but the men of the 442nd

00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:23.434
came up with a unique

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:25.734
but dangerous idea:

00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:27.529
The backside of the mountain

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:30.190
was a sheer rock cliff.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.599
The Germans thought an attack from the backside

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:36.109
would be impossible.

00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:40.480
The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.223
On a dark, moonless night,

00:12:44.223 --> 00:12:48.471
they began scaling that rock wall,

00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:52.090
a drop of more than 1,000 feet,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.737
in full combat gear.

00:12:54.737 --> 00:12:57.581
They climbed all night long

00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:00.631
on that sheer cliff.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.232
In the darkness,

00:13:04.232 --> 00:13:06.312
some lost their handhold

00:13:06.312 --> 00:13:07.925
or their footing

00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:10.122
and they fell to their deaths

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.203
in the ravine below.

00:13:12.203 --> 00:13:16.630
They all fell silently.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.195
Not a single one cried out,

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:22.427
so as not to give their position away.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:26.285
The men climbed for eight hours straight,

00:13:26.285 --> 00:13:29.404
and those who made it to the top

00:13:29.404 --> 00:13:33.886
stayed there until the first break of light,

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:36.965
and as soon as light broke,

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:38.558
they attacked.

00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:40.212
The Germans were surprised,

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:41.960
and they took the hill

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.970
and broke the Gothic Line.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.258
A six-month stalemate

00:13:47.258 --> 00:13:49.463
was broken by the 442nd

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:52.444
in 32 minutes.

00:13:52.444 --> 00:13:56.080
It was an amazing act,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.930
and when the war ended,

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.147
the 442nd returned to the United States

00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:04.563
as the most decorated unit

00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:07.480
of the entire Second World War.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.210
They were greeted back on the White House Lawn

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.816
by President Truman, who said to them,

00:14:12.816 --> 00:14:16.074
"You fought not only the enemy

00:14:16.074 --> 00:14:20.694
but prejudice, and you won."

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:24.290
They are my heroes.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.337
They clung to their belief

00:14:27.337 --> 00:14:30.389
in the shining ideals of this country,

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:34.680
and they proved that being an American

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.890
is not just for some people,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:43.323
that race is not how we define being an American.

00:14:43.323 --> 00:14:46.900
They expanded what it means to be an American,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.224
including Japanese-Americans

00:14:49.224 --> 00:14:53.398
that were feared and suspected and hated.

00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:56.609
They were change agents,

00:14:56.609 --> 00:14:59.091
and they left for me

00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.308
a legacy.

00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:03.097
They are my heroes

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:05.448
and my father is my hero,

00:15:05.448 --> 00:15:07.258
who understood democracy

00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:11.329
and guided me through it.

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:13.819
They gave me a legacy,

00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:17.181
and with that legacy comes a responsibility,

00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:19.597
and I am dedicated

00:15:19.597 --> 00:15:21.586
to making my country

00:15:21.586 --> 00:15:24.790
an even better America,

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.000
to making our government

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.497
an even truer democracy,

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:34.237
and because of the heroes that I have

00:15:34.237 --> 00:15:37.859
and the struggles that we've gone through,

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:39.858
I can stand before you

00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:42.717
as a gay Japanese-American,

00:15:42.717 --> 00:15:45.184
but even more than that,

00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:49.192
I am a proud American.

00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:51.379
Thank you very much.

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:53.350
(Applause)
