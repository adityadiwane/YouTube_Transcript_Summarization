00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.318
Here are two reasons companies fail:

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:19.167
they only do more of the same,

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.659
or they only do what's new.

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:28.513
To me the real, real
solution to quality growth

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:32.102
is figuring out the balance
between two activities:

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.698
exploration and exploitation.

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:36.704
Both are necessary,

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:39.441
but it can be too much of a good thing.

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:42.386
Consider Facit.

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:45.465
I'm actually old enough to remember them.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.657
Facit was a fantastic company.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.472
They were born deep in the Swedish forest,

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:54.002
and they made the best
mechanical calculators in the world.

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:55.900
Everybody used them.

00:00:56.798 --> 00:01:00.977
And what did Facit do when
the electronic calculator came along?

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.414
They continued doing exactly the same.

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:08.671
In six months, they went
from maximum revenue ...

00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:09.931
and they were gone.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.800
Gone.

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:15.696
To me, the irony about the Facit story

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.986
is hearing about the Facit engineers,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.093
who had bought cheap, small
electronic calculators in Japan

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.778
that they used to double-check
their calculators.

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:29.215
(Laughter)

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.887
Facit did too much exploitation.

00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:34.876
But exploration can go wild, too.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.051
A few years back,

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:40.101
I worked closely alongside
a European biotech company.

00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:42.806
Let's call them OncoSearch.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.487
The company was brilliant.

00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:49.129
They had applications that promised
to diagnose, even cure,

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:51.645
certain forms of blood cancer.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.720
Every day was about
creating something new.

00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:58.248
They were extremely innovative,

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:01.148
and the mantra was,
"When we only get it right,"

00:02:01.172 --> 00:02:03.830
or even, "We want it perfect."

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.544
The sad thing is,

00:02:06.568 --> 00:02:08.466
before they became perfect --

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.419
even good enough --

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:12.037
they became obsolete.

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:16.352
OncoSearch did too much exploration.

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:23.357
I first heard about exploration
and exploitation about 15 years ago,

00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:26.881
when I worked as a visiting
scholar at Stanford University.

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:30.144
The founder of the idea is Jim March.

00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:34.551
And to me the power of the idea
is its practicality.

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:36.823
Exploration.

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:40.217
Exploration is about
coming up with what's new.

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:42.003
It's about search,

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.470
it's about discovery,

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:45.056
it's about new products,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.921
it's about new innovations.

00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:50.595
It's about changing our frontiers.

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:54.843
Our heroes are people
who have done exploration:

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.208
Madame Curie,

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:57.390
Picasso,

00:02:57.414 --> 00:02:58.588
Neil Armstrong,

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:00.771
Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.545
I come from Norway;

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.353
all our heroes are explorers,
and they deserve to be.

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:12.430
We all know that exploration is risky.

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:14.273
We don't know the answers,

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:16.368
we don't know if we're going to find them,

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.669
and we know that the risks are high.

00:03:18.693 --> 00:03:20.584
Exploitation is the opposite.

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.685
Exploitation is taking
the knowledge we have

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.504
and making good, better.

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:29.647
Exploitation is about making
our trains run on time.

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:33.972
It's about making good products
faster and cheaper.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.944
Exploitation is not risky --

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:39.072
in the short term.

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:41.401
But if we only exploit,

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.818
it's very risky in the long term.

00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:48.261
And I think we all have memories
of the famous pop groups

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:51.236
who keep singing the same songs
again and again,

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.325
until they become obsolete
or even pathetic.

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:58.448
That's the risk of exploitation.

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:04.432
So if we take a long-term
perspective, we explore.

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:08.604
If we take a short-term
perspective, we exploit.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:12.144
Small children, they explore all day.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.675
All day it's about exploration.

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:16.739
As we grow older,

00:04:16.763 --> 00:04:20.641
we explore less because we have
more knowledge to exploit on.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.763
The same goes for companies.

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:28.570
Companies become,
by nature, less innovative

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:30.483
as they become more competent.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:34.493
And this is, of course,
a big worry to CEOs.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.919
And I hear very often questions
phrased in different ways.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:41.101
For example,

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:45.673
"How can I both effectively run
and reinvent my company?"

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.451
Or, "How can I make sure

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:52.836
that our company changes
before we become obsolete

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.474
or are hit by a crisis?"

00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.140
So, doing one well is difficult.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.931
Doing both well as the same time is art --

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.800
pushing both exploration and exploitation.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.634
So one thing we've found

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:13.354
is only about two percent of companies
are able to effectively explore

00:05:13.378 --> 00:05:16.723
and exploit at the same time, in parallel.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.454
But when they do,

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:21.427
the payoffs are huge.

00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:24.726
So we have lots of great examples.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.466
We have NestlÃ© creating Nespresso,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.512
we have Lego going into animated films,

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:32.942
Toyota creating the hybrids,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.437
Unilever pushing into sustainability --

00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:38.642
there are lots of examples,
and the benefits are huge.

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:42.348
Why is balancing so difficult?

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:45.476
I think it's difficult
because there are so many traps

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.150
that keep us where we are.

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:50.338
So I'll talk about two,
but there are many.

00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:54.086
So let's talk about
the perpetual search trap.

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:56.428
We discover something,

00:05:56.452 --> 00:05:59.307
but we don't have the patience
or the persistence

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.659
to get at it and make it work.

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:04.828
So instead of staying with it,
we create something new.

00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:06.152
But the same goes for that,

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:07.927
then we're in the vicious circle

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:11.263
of actually coming up with ideas
but being frustrated.

00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.701
OncoSearch was a good example.

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:17.548
A famous example is, of course, Xerox.

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:20.707
But we don't only see this in companies.

00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:23.245
We see this in the public sector as well.

00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:29.448
We all know that any kind
of effective reform of education,

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.899
research, health care, even defense,

00:06:31.923 --> 00:06:35.326
takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.

00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:38.578
But still, we change much more often.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.975
We really don't give them the chance.

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:45.444
Another trap is the success trap.

00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:49.555
Facit fell into the success trap.

00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:53.525
They literally held
the future in their hands,

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:54.763
but they couldn't see it.

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:58.542
They were simply so good
at making what they loved doing,

00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:00.232
that they wouldn't change.

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.480
We are like that, too.

00:07:02.504 --> 00:07:05.251
When we know something well,
it's difficult to change.

00:07:06.872 --> 00:07:08.170
Bill Gates has said:

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:12.016
"Success is a lousy teacher.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.614
It seduces us into thinking
we cannot fail."

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:18.367
That's the challenge with success.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:23.340
So I think there are some lessons,
and I think they apply to us.

00:07:23.364 --> 00:07:25.105
And they apply to our companies.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.960
The first lesson is:
get ahead of the crisis.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.518
And any company that's able to innovate

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:36.338
is actually able to also buy
an insurance in the future.

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:39.572
Netflix -- they could so easily
have been content

00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:42.460
with earlier generations of distribution,

00:07:42.484 --> 00:07:45.041
but they always -- and I think
they will always --

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.040
keep pushing for the next battle.

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:49.937
I see other companies that say,

00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:54.402
"I'll win the next innovation cycle,
whatever it takes."

00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:58.517
Second one: think in multiple time scales.

00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:00.256
I'll share a chart with you,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.138
and I think it's a wonderful one.

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:04.174
Any company we look at,

00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:05.997
taking a one-year perspective

00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:08.298
and looking at the valuation
of the company,

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:11.701
innovation typically accounts
for only about 30 percent.

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:13.574
So when we think one year,

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:15.880
innovation isn't really that important.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.058
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective
on the same company --

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:25.260
suddenly, innovation and ability
to renew account for 70 percent.

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:27.730
But companies can't choose.

00:08:27.754 --> 00:08:31.660
They need to fund the journey
and lead the long term.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:33.922
Third:

00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:35.541
invite talent.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.522
I don't think it's possible for any of us

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:43.076
to be able to balance exploration
and exploitation by ourselves.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.806
I think it's a team sport.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.219
I think we need to allow challenging.

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:53.163
I think the mark of a great company
is being open to be challenged,

00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:57.410
and the mark of a good corporate board
is to constructively challenge.

00:08:58.264 --> 00:09:01.870
I think that's also what
good parenting is about.

00:09:02.858 --> 00:09:05.339
Last one: be skeptical of success.

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:12.466
Maybe it's useful to think back
at the old triumph marches in Rome,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.986
when the generals, after a big victory,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.361
were given their celebration.

00:09:18.754 --> 00:09:21.489
Riding into Rome on the carriage,

00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:25.735
they always had a companion
whispering in their ear,

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:28.245
"Remember, you're only human."

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:32.677
So I hope I made the point:

00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:35.723
balancing exploration and exploitation

00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:37.194
has a huge payoff.

00:09:37.218 --> 00:09:39.779
But it's difficult,
and we need to be conscious.

00:09:40.338 --> 00:09:44.783
I want to just point out two questions
that I think are useful.

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:48.801
First question is,
looking at your own company:

00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:53.756
In which areas do you see
that the company is at the risk

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.024
of falling into success traps,

00:09:56.048 --> 00:09:58.579
of just going on autopilot?

00:09:59.105 --> 00:10:02.286
And what can you do to challenge?

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:05.242
Second question is:

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.791
When did I explore something new last,

00:10:09.815 --> 00:10:12.068
and what kind of effect did it have on me?

00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:15.028
Is that something I should do more of?

00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:16.845
In my case, yes.

00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:20.668
So let me leave you with this.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:23.973
Whether you're an explorer by nature

00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:27.899
or whether you tend to exploit
what you already know,

00:10:27.923 --> 00:10:32.007
don't forget: the beauty
is in the balance.

00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:34.552
Thank you.

00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:37.197
(Applause)
