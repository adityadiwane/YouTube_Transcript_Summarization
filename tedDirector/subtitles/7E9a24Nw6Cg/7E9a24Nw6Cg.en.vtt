00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:12.845
Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful
to be on board one of these things.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.392
(Engine roars)

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:16.995
It's an entirely different perspective.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.919
You're not looking up at the universe.

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:21.701
You and the Earth are going
through the Universe together.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:26.277
Fabien Cousteau: I think the oceans
still hold quite a few secrets,

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:29.594
but if we're to explore
the final frontier on this planet,

00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:31.380
we need to live there.

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:32.920
[Journeyed around the world.]

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:36.379
Vincent Moon: I felt the need to travel
and to discover some other music,

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.766
to explore the world,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.623
and actually it was also this idea
of nomadic cinema that I had in mind.

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:46.365
Daria van den Bercken: Recently, I flew
over a crowd of thousands of people

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.718
in Brazil, playing music
by George Frideric Handel.

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:53.667
I also drove along
the streets of Amsterdam.

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:55.747
I fell in love with the music,

00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.282
and I wanted to share it
with as many people as possible.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:03.693
Ben Saunders: It was a journey,
an expedition in Antarctica,

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:06.101
the coldest, windiest, driest,

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.064
and highest-altitude continent on Earth.

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:09.791
[And even traveled back in time.]

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:12.463
Allan Adams: Keep looking
further and further,

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:16.666
and then finally you see
a faint, fading afterglow,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.008
and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.783
[We took bold steps forward.]

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:23.980
Hugh Herr: We the people need not
accept our limitations,

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.499
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:29.362
[Helped medicine get personal.]

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:32.396
Leana Wen: When doctors
are willing to step off our pedestals,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.121
take off our white coats
and show our patients who we are

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:36.669
and what medicine is all about,

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:39.673
that's when we begin to overcome
the sickness of fear.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:41.628
That's when we establish trust.

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:44.789
Manu Prakash: It starts
with a single sheet of paper.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.992
What you see here
is all the possible components

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:51.834
to build a functional, bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:55.262
Jorge Soto: Catching cancer early
is basically the closest thing we have

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:57.283
to a silver-bullet cure against it,

00:01:57.307 --> 00:02:00.447
and that is why my team and I
have decided to begin this journey,

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:03.110
to try to make cancer detection
at the early stages

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:06.401
easier, cheaper, smarter,
and more accessible.

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:08.973
[We re-examined power.]

00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:12.185
Eric Liu: The problem we face today,
here in America in particular,

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.492
but all around the world,

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:17.825
is that far too many people
are profoundly illiterate in power.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.122
Pia Mancini: If Internet
is the new printing press,

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:25.152
then what is democracy
for the Internet era?

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:28.425
Jeremy Heimans: Let's for a second
talk about what new power isn't.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.245
New power is not your Facebook page.

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.539
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:36.999
I assure you that his Facebook page

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.417
has not embraced
the power of participation.

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:40.972
[Re-defined success.]

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:44.346
Simon Anholt: We don't admire countries
primarily because they're rich,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.174
because they're powerful, successful,

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.109
modern, or technologically advanced.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.096
We primarily admire countries
that are good.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.548
Michael Green: GDP is a tool
to help us measure economic performance.

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:58.281
It's not a measure of our well-being.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.223
[Reckoned with rising inequality.]

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.560
Nick Hanauer: No free
and open society can long sustain

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:06.501
this kind of rising economic inequality.

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.619
It has never happened.
There are no examples.

00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:11.647
You show me a highly unequal society,

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.027
and I will show you
a police state or an uprising.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.337
Thomas Piketty: When inequality
gets too extreme,

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.539
then it becomes useless for growth.

00:03:19.563 --> 00:03:24.984
Charmian Gooch: My wish is for us to know
who owns and controls companies

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:29.304
so that they can no longer be used
anonymously against the public good.

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.451
[Wrestled with the power of big data.]

00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:35.209
Kenneth Cukier: We have to be the master
of this technology, not its servant.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.427
We are just at the outset
of the big data era.

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.735
Jennifer Golbeck:
By liking that Facebook page,

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.115
or by sharing this piece
of personal information,

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.457
you've now improved my ability to predict
whether you're using drugs

00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:47.775
or whether you get along well
in the workplace.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.408
Anne Milgram: I wanted
to introduce data and analytics

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:53.237
and rigorous statistical
analysis into our work.

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.043
In short, I wanted
to moneyball criminal justice.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.002
[And debated the right to privacy.]

00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:00.540
Glenn Greenwald: The United States
and its partners,

00:04:00.564 --> 00:04:03.894
unbeknownst to the entire world,
has converted the Internet

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:09.189
into an unprecedented zone
of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.

00:04:09.213 --> 00:04:12.519
Richard Ledgett: This is not NSA
running off and doing its own things.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:16.799
This is a legitimate activity
of the United States foreign government

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.880
that was agreed to by all the branches.

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:24.131
Edward Snowden: We don't have to give up
our privacy to have good government.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:26.063
Keren Elazari: I think we need hackers,

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:32.566
and in fact, they just might be
the immune system for the information age.

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.676
[We empathized with those who suffer.]

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.812
Melissa Fleming: Every day, 32,000 people

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:40.180
will be forcibly displaced
from their homes.

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.599
Kimberley Motley:
And what justness means to me,

00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:47.258
it's using laws for their
intended purpose, to protect.

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:50.122
Eman Mohammed: My work is not
meant to hide the scars of war

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:53.903
but to show the full frame
of unseen stories of Gazans.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.934
Sebastian Junger: I've been
covering wars for almost 20 years,

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.504
and one of the remarkable things

00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:00.794
is how many soldiers
find themselves missing it.

00:05:00.818 --> 00:05:05.011
Kevin Briggs: In my experience,
it's not just the talking that you do,

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.323
but the listening.

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:08.362
Listen to understand.

00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:11.276
[Recognized creativity
as a constant pursuit.]

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.437
Sting: Day after day, you face
a blank page and nothing's coming,

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:16.788
and those days turn to weeks
and weeks to months,

00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:20.549
and pretty soon, those months have turned
into years with very little to show.

00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:23.284
Mark Ronson: You have to take
an element of those things

00:05:23.308 --> 00:05:25.249
and bring something fresh and new to it.

00:05:25.273 --> 00:05:27.970
Sarah Lewis: Mastery is about
sacrificing for your craft

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.623
and not for the sake
of crafting your career.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.789
Elizabeth Gilbert: The only trick
is that you've got to identify

00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:35.993
the best, worthiest thing
that you love most,

00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:38.127
and then build your house
right on top of it

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.473
and don't budge from it.

00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:41.025
[We watched language evolve.]

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.038
Jamila Lyiscott:
Let there be no confusion

00:05:43.062 --> 00:05:44.373
Let there be no hesitation

00:05:44.597 --> 00:05:46.396
This is not a promotion of ignorance

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.056
This is a linguistic celebration

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.994
Jill Shargaa: Webster's dictionary
defines the word "awesome"

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:56.849
as fear mingled with
admiration or reverence.

00:05:56.873 --> 00:06:01.153
With that in mind,
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:03.497
Anne Curzan: Multi-slacking
is the act of having

00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:05.445
multiple windows up on your screen

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.289
so it looks like you're working when
you're actually goofing around on the web.

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:10.333
(Laughter)

00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:14.138
[We saw the future.]

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.574
Nicholas Negroponte: So my prediction is
that we are going to ingest information.

00:06:19.598 --> 00:06:21.925
You're going to swallow
a pill and know English.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.805
You're going to swallow
a pill and know Shakespeare.

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.362
[And most importantly

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.523
we saw the best versions of ourselves.]

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:31.138
Dan Gilbert: Human beings
are works in progress

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:34.078
that mistakenly think they're finished.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.368
Isabel Allende: "Tell me,
what is it that you plan to do

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:41.316
with your one wild and precious life?"

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.891
Me, I intend to live passionately.

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:47.629
Ziauddin Yousafzai: People ask me,
what special is in my mentorship

00:06:47.653 --> 00:06:52.320
which has made Malala so bold
and so courageous and poised.

00:06:52.344 --> 00:06:56.417
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.

00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:59.239
Ask me what I did not do.

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.950
I did not clip her wings.

00:07:03.212 --> 00:07:06.353
Zak Ebrahim: Violence isn't inherent
in one's religion or race.

00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:11.029
I choose to use my experience
to fight back against terrorism,

00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:12.666
against the bigotry.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.447
Mellody Hobson: I think it's time
for us to be comfortable

00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:18.150
with the uncomfortable
conversation about race.

00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:20.345
We cannot afford to be color blind.

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:23.631
We have to be color brave.

00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:25.546
Geena Rocero: My deepest truth

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.175
allowed me to accept who I am. Will you?

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.090
Shaka Senghor: So what I'm asking today

00:07:33.114 --> 00:07:35.252
is that you envision a world

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:39.458
where men and women
aren't held hostage to their past,

00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:43.030
where misdeeds and mistakes don't
define you for the rest of your life.

00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:48.782
Maysoon Zayid: I gotta tell you,
I got 99 problems and palsy is just one.

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:53.471
If there was an Oppression Olympics,
I would win the gold medal.

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:56.607
I'm Palestinian, Muslim,

00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.892
I'm female, I'm disabled,
and I live in New Jersey.

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:03.342
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:08.455
Gabby Giffords: Be a leader.
Set an example.

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.167
Be passionate.

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.179
Be courageous. Be your best.

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:17.957
Andrew Solomon:
Forge meaning, build identity,

00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:21.222
and then invite the world
to share your joy.

00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.444
[What will 2015 bring?]
