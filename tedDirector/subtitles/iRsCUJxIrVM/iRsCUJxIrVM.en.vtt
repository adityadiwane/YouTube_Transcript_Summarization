00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I was born in Switzerland

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and raised in Ghana, West Africa.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Ghana felt safe to me as a child.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I was free, I was happy.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The early 70s

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But then by the end of the decade,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
the country had fallen back into political instability

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and mismanagement.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
In 1979,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I witnessed my first military coup.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
We the children had gathered at a friend's house.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It was a dimly lit shack.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
There was a beaten up black and white television

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
flickering in the background,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and a former head of state and general

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
was being blindfolded

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and tied to the pole.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
The firing squad aimed, fired --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
the general was dead.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Now this was being broadcast live.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
And shortly after, we left the country,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and we returned to Switzerland.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Now Europe came as a shock to me,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
and I think I started feeling the need

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
to shed my skin in order to fit in.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
I think it was a tactic of survival.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And it worked, or so I believed.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
So here I was in 2008

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
wondering where I was in my life.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I was always playing the exotic African.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I was playing the violent African,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
the African terrorist.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
And I was thinking,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
how many terrorists could I possibly play

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
before turning into one myself?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And I had become ashamed of the other,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
the African in me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And fortunately I decided in 2008

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
to return to Ghana,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
after 28 years of absence.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I wanted to document on film

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
the 2008 presidential elections.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And there, I started by searching

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
for the footprints in my childhood.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And before I even knew it,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I was suddenly on a stage

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
surrounded by thousands of cheering people

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
during a political rally.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And I realized that, when I'd left the country,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
free and fair elections in a democratic environment

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
were a dream.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
though a fragile reality.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
And I was thinking,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
was Ghana searching for its identity

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
like I was looking for my identity?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
for what was happening in me?

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.260
And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
I hadn't lived up to my full potential.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
I mean, nor had Ghana,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
even though we had been trying very hard.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Now in 1957,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to gain its independence.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
In the late 50s,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and Ghana is not.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
But maybe it was time to prove to myself,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
yes, it's important to understand the past,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
it is important to look at it in a different light,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.260
but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and build on those foundations in the present.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.260
So here I was, December 7th, 2008.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.260
The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.260
but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
because they wanted to make their voices heard.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
He said that his vote was in his heart.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
And I understood, this was their election,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and they weren't going to let anyone

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
take it away from them.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner --

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
so nobody had achieved the absolute majority --

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
so voting went into a second round three weeks later.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
The heat was on.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And then the cliche came to haunt us.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
There were claims of intimidation

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
at the polling stations,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.260
of ballot boxes being stolen.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Inflated results started coming in

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
and the mob was starting to get out of control.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.260
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
People were being beaten brutally.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It was complete chaos.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And my heart sank,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
because I thought, here we are again.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Here is another proof

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
that the African is not capable of governing himself.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
And not only that, I am documenting it --

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.260
documenting my own cultural shortcomings.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
So when the echo of the gunshots

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
had lingered,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and I didn't believe what I was hearing.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
They were chanting, "We want peace.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
We want peace."

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And I realized it had to come from the people.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
After all, they decide,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and they did.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.260
So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
were suddenly a melody.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
The sounds of the voices were harmonious.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So it could happen.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
A democracy could be upheld peacefully.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
It could be, by the will of the masses

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
who were now urgently pressing

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
with all their heart and all their will

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
for peace.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
Now here's an interesting comparison.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
We in the West,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
we preach the values,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
the golden light of democracy,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
that we are the shining example of how it's done.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
But when it comes down to it,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.260
Ghana found itself in the same place

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
in which the U.S. election stalled

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
in the 2000 presidential elections --

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Bush versus Gore.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Ghana honored democracy

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and its people.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
the people did.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
Now the second round of voting

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
did not bring forth a clear winner either.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I mean, it was so incredibly close.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
The electoral commissioner declared,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
with the consent of the parties,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
to run an unprecedented

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
second re-run.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.260
So the people went back to the polls

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to determine their own president,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
not the legal system.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And guess what, it worked.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
The defeated candidate

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
gave up power

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
I mean, at the absolute time

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
for the absolute need of democracy,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
they did not abuse their power.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.260
proving that the African is capable of governing himself.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
is not over,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.260
but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and that we must not take it for granted.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Now I have learned

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
that my place is not just in the West or in Africa,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
and I'm still searching

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
for my identity,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
but I saw Ghana

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
create democracy better.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
Ghana taught me

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
to look at people differently

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and to look at myself differently.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And yes,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
we Africans can.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Thank you.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
(Applause)
