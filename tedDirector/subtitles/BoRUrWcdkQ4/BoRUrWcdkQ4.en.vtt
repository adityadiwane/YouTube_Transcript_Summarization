00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.204
So my freshman year of college

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.954
I signed up for an internship in the housing unit

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.154
at Greater Boston Legal Services.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.807
Showed up the first day

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:26.123
ready to make coffee and photocopies,

00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:30.705
but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:32.174
named Jeff Purcell,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:34.639
who thrust me onto the front lines

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:36.639
from the very first day.

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.404
And over the course of nine months

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.417
I had the chance

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.189
to have dozens of conversations

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:43.973
with low-income families in Boston

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:47.089
who would come in presenting with housing issues,

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.373
but always had an underlying health issue.

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:52.605
So I had a client who came in,

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.923
about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:57.211
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course,

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.705
because he's paying for his HIV medication

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.905
and just can't afford both.

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.256
We had moms who would come in,

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:04.639
daughter has asthma,

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.524
wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:09.497
And one of our litigation strategies

00:01:09.497 --> 00:01:12.272
was actually to send me into the home of these clients

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.405
with these large glass bottles.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.405
And I would collect the cockroaches,

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:19.423
hot glue-gun them to this poster board

00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:21.455
that we'd bring to court for our cases.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:22.733
And we always won

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.455
because the judges were just so grossed out.

00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:27.604
Far more effective, I have to say,

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:30.455
than anything I later learned in law school.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:33.005
But over the course of these nine months,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.856
I grew frustrated with feeling

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:37.822
like we were intervening too far downstream

00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:40.339
in the lives of our clients --

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:41.871
that by the time they came to us,

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.039
they were already in crisis.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.855
And at the end of my freshman year of college,

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:48.539
I read an article about the work

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.321
that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.457
as Chair of Pediatrics

00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:53.857
at Boston Medical Center.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.924
And his first hire was a legal services attorney

00:01:56.924 --> 00:01:58.806
to represent the patients.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:00.321
So I called Barry,

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.924
and with his blessing, in October 1995

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:04.989
walked into the waiting room

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.855
of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:09.188
I'll never forget,

00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:12.072
the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.

00:02:12.072 --> 00:02:15.006
And the exhaustion of mothers

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.538
who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.470
to bring their child to the doctor

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.354
was just palpable.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:23.602
The doctors, it seemed,

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.121
never really had enough time for all the patients,

00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.371
try as they might.

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:27.589
And over the course of six months,

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.270
I would corner them in the hallway

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.171
and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:35.656
"If you had unlimited resources,

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.971
what's the one thing you would give your patients?"

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.671
And I heard the same story again and again,

00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:44.621
a story we've heard hundreds of times since then.

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:48.186
They said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic --

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:49.887
child has an ear infection,

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:51.820
I prescribe antibiotics.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.653
But the real issue is there's no food at home.

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:56.154
The real issue

00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:58.388
is that child is living with 12 other people

00:02:58.388 --> 00:02:59.886
in a two-bedroom apartment.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.736
And I don't even ask about those issues

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:04.487
because there's nothing I can do.

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:06.325
I have 13 minutes with each patient.

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.894
Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.

00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:11.579
I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.927
And I don't even have any help."

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.127
In that clinic, even today,

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:16.813
there are two social workers

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:19.544
for 24,000 pediatric patients,

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.396
which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:25.427
So Health Leads was born of these conversations --

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:26.611
a simple model

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:28.126
where doctors and nurses

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:30.344
can prescribe nutritious food,

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:31.646
heat in the winter

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:34.228
and other basic resources for their patients

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.779
the same way they prescribe medication.

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.760
Patients then take their prescriptions

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.227
to our desk in the clinic waiting room

00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:45.044
where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates

00:03:45.044 --> 00:03:47.496
who work side by side with these families

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:48.795
to connect them out

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.011
to the existing landscape of community resources.

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:55.560
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room --

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.710
totally lemonade stand style.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.030
But today we have a thousand college student advocates

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.330
who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.531
with the resources that they need to be healthy.

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.047
So 18 months ago

00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:12.832
I got this email that changed my life.

00:04:12.832 --> 00:04:15.247
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:18.231
who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads

00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:19.530
and to share, as he said,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.166
a bit of historical context.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:25.116
In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:28.130
one of the first two community health centers in this country,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.281
in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:33.797
And so many of his patients came in

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:35.947
presenting with malnutrition

00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:38.431
that be began prescribing food for them.

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.682
And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.780
which would fill them

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.598
and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.

00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:48.481
And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. --

00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:50.316
which was funding Geiger's clinic --

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.515
found out about this,

00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:52.715
they were furious.

00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.464
And they sent this bureaucrat down

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:57.415
to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars

00:04:57.415 --> 00:04:58.881
for medical care --

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:02.281
to which Geiger famously and logically responded,

00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:04.706
"The last time I checked my textbooks,

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:09.065
the specific therapy for malnutrition was food."

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:10.349
(Laughter)

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.048
So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,

00:05:13.048 --> 00:05:15.414
I knew I was supposed to be proud

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:17.081
to be part of this history.

00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:18.297
But the truth is

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:20.289
I was devastated.

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.630
Here we are,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.615
45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:27.630
and I have doctors telling me,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.697
"On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:34.130
Forty-five years after Geiger,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.681
Health Leads has to reinvent

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:38.516
the prescription for basic resources.

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:41.681
So I have spent hours upon hours

00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.015
trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:47.549
How is it that if for decades

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:50.318
we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:52.915
and especially low-income patients, healthy,

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:54.816
that we didn't use it?

00:05:54.816 --> 00:05:57.915
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system

00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:00.414
rather than a sick-care system,

00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:02.447
why don't we just do it?

00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:04.681
These questions, in my mind,

00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:07.747
are not hard because the answers are complicated,

00:06:07.747 --> 00:06:12.881
they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.981
My belief is that it's almost too painful

00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:19.210
to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.948
or even admit that we have any at all.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.115
Because if we did,

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.731
they would be so removed

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:26.917
from our current reality.

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:29.880
But that doesn't change my belief

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.798
that all of us, deep inside,

00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:36.365
here in this room and across this country,

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:39.281
share a similar set of desires.

00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:41.414
That if we are honest with ourselves

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:43.715
and listen quietly,

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:45.531
that we all harbor

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.731
one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:

00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.831
that it keep us healthy.

00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:55.148
This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.548
is an enormously powerful one.

00:06:57.548 --> 00:07:00.165
And the way I think about this

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:02.349
is that healthcare is like any other system.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.915
It's just a set of choices that people make.

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:06.716
What if we decided

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:09.132
to make a different set of choices?

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:12.164
What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:13.966
that have drifted away from us

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.432
and stand firm and say, "No.

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:18.399
These things are ours.

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:20.398
They will be used for our purposes.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.422
They will be used to realize

00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:24.353
our aspiration"?

00:07:24.353 --> 00:07:26.103
What if everything we needed

00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:28.248
to realize our aspiration for healthcare

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.831
was right there in front of us

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.715
just waiting to be claimed?

00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:33.765
So that's where Health Leads began.

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:35.449
We started with the prescription pad --

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.848
a very ordinary piece of paper --

00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:41.816
and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy --

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.834
antibiotics, an inhaler, medication --

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:47.617
but what do patients need to be healthy,

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:50.164
to not get sick in the first place?

00:07:50.164 --> 00:07:52.015
And we chose to use the prescription

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:53.797
for that purpose.

00:07:53.797 --> 00:07:54.999
So just a few miles from here

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:56.783
at Children's National Medical Center,

00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:59.049
when patients come into the doctor's office,

00:07:59.049 --> 00:08:00.734
they're asked a few questions.

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:03.398
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?

00:08:03.398 --> 00:08:04.964
Do you have safe housing?"

00:08:04.964 --> 00:08:07.033
And when the doctor begins the visit,

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:09.866
she knows height, weight, is there food at home,

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:11.482
is the family living in a shelter.

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:14.366
And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:18.416
but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,

00:08:18.416 --> 00:08:22.082
using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.

00:08:22.082 --> 00:08:24.315
The problem is,

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.514
once you get a taste of what it's like

00:08:26.514 --> 00:08:28.749
to realize your aspiration for healthcare,

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:30.267
you want more.

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:31.030
So we thought,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.631
if we can get individual doctors

00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:35.848
to prescribe these basic resources for their patients,

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.565
could we get an entire healthcare system

00:08:38.565 --> 00:08:41.317
to shift its presumption?

00:08:41.317 --> 00:08:42.564
And we gave it a shot.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.999
So now at Harlem Hospital Center

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:47.785
when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,

00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:49.649
the electronic medical record

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:53.449
automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:54.915
And our volunteers can then work with them

00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:58.132
to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs

00:08:58.132 --> 00:08:59.564
in their communities.

00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:00.698
We've created a presumption

00:09:00.698 --> 00:09:02.265
that if you're a patient at that hospital

00:09:02.265 --> 00:09:03.815
with an elevated BMI,

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:06.049
the four walls of the doctor's office

00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:07.901
probably aren't going to give you everything

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:09.083
you need to be healthy.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.483
You need more.

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:11.164
So on the one hand,

00:09:11.164 --> 00:09:12.861
this is just a basic recoding

00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:14.566
of the electronic medical record.

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:16.284
And on the other hand,

00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:17.933
it's a radical transformation

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.101
of the electronic medical record

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:23.983
from a static repository of diagnostic information

00:09:23.983 --> 00:09:26.817
to a health promotion tool.

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:27.934
In the private sector,

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.554
when you squeeze that kind of additional value

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:32.301
out of a fixed-cost investment,

00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.901
it's called a billion-dollar company.

00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:36.282
But in my world,

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:39.683
it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:41.566
It's called healthcare --

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:44.549
a system where doctors can prescribe solutions

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:46.099
to improve health,

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:48.248
not just manage disease.

00:09:48.248 --> 00:09:49.782
Same thing in the clinic waiting room.

00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:51.399
So every day in this country

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.899
three million patients

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:57.393
pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.

00:09:57.404 --> 00:09:59.377
And what do they do when they're there?

00:09:59.377 --> 00:10:02.827
They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,

00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:05.310
they read extremely old copies

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.593
of Good Housekeeping magazine.

00:10:07.593 --> 00:10:10.826
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:12.177
How did we get here

00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:15.526
where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours

00:10:15.526 --> 00:10:17.309
to waiting?

00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:18.526
What if we had a waiting room

00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:20.627
where you don't just sit when you're sick,

00:10:20.627 --> 00:10:22.493
but where you go to get healthy.

00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:25.010
If airports can become shopping malls

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.976
and McDonald's can become playgrounds,

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:31.409
surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:33.443
And that's what Health Leads has tried to do,

00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:35.726
to reclaim that real estate and that time

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:37.158
and to use it as a gateway

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:38.210
to connect patients

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.977
to the resources they need to be healthy.

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:42.493
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,

00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:44.960
your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.127
and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:49.659
because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:52.576
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,

00:10:52.576 --> 00:10:54.776
the waiting room became the place

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:57.260
where Health Leads turned your heat back on?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.878
And of course all of this requires

00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:00.826
a broader workforce.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.993
But if we're creative, we already have that too.

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:06.379
We know that our doctors and nurses

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:07.726
and even social workers

00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:09.194
aren't enough,

00:11:09.194 --> 00:11:10.843
that the ticking minutes of health care

00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:12.261
are too constraining.

00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:14.310
Health just takes more time.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.109
It requires a non-clinical army

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:19.793
of community health workers and case managers

00:11:19.793 --> 00:11:21.409
and many others.

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:24.559
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.260
were the 11 million college students in this country?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.026
Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities,

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:33.628
unwilling to take no for an answer

00:11:33.628 --> 00:11:35.210
from those bureaucracies

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.143
that tend to crush patients,

00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:39.093
and with an unparalleled ability

00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:40.545
for information retrieval

00:11:40.545 --> 00:11:43.526
honed through years of using Google.

00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:46.059
Now lest you think it improbable

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.676
that a college volunteer

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:49.459
can make this kind of commitment,

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.026
I have two words for you:

00:11:51.026 --> 00:11:53.377
March Madness.

00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:57.344
The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player

00:11:57.344 --> 00:12:00.609
dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.

00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:02.761
Now we may think that's good or bad,

00:12:02.761 --> 00:12:05.443
but in either case it's real.

00:12:05.443 --> 00:12:07.628
And Health Leads is based on the presumption

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:09.010
that for too long

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.560
we have asked too little of our college students

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.325
when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:16.678
College sports teams say,

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:18.743
"We're going to take dozens of hours

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:22.627
at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning

00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:25.443
and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,

00:12:25.443 --> 00:12:27.609
and if you don't measure up or you don't show up,

00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:29.059
we're going to cut you off the team.

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:30.947
But we'll make huge investments

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:32.159
in your training and development,

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.577
and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.392
And people line up out the door

00:12:37.392 --> 00:12:40.177
just for the chance to be part of it.

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.394
So our feeling is,

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:42.877
if it's good enough for the rugby team,

00:12:42.877 --> 00:12:44.992
it's good enough for health and poverty.

00:12:44.992 --> 00:12:48.260
Health Leads too recruits competitively,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.741
trains intensively,

00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:51.710
coaches professionally,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.659
demands significant time,

00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:55.026
builds a cohesive team

00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.510
and measures results --

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.193
a kind of Teach for America for healthcare.

00:12:59.193 --> 00:13:01.293
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.

00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:03.612
with the largest number of Medicaid patients,

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:06.826
each of those has at least 20,000 college students.

00:13:06.826 --> 00:13:10.027
New York alone has half a million college students.

00:13:10.027 --> 00:13:13.076
And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce

00:13:13.076 --> 00:13:15.326
to connect patients to basic resources,

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:18.927
it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline

00:13:18.927 --> 00:13:21.377
who've spent two, three, four years

00:13:21.377 --> 00:13:22.878
in the clinic waiting room

00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:26.862
talking to patients about their most basic health needs.

00:13:26.862 --> 00:13:28.611
And they leave with the conviction,

00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:30.443
the ability and the efficacy

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:34.226
to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:37.244
And the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.

00:13:37.244 --> 00:13:41.061
So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine

00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:42.476
at UCSF Medical Center,

00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:44.809
but for three years as an undergraduate

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:46.442
she was a Health Leads volunteer

00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:49.444
in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.

00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:53.159
Mia says, "When my classmates write a prescription,

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:55.177
they think their work is done.

00:13:55.177 --> 00:13:56.893
When I write a prescription,

00:13:56.893 --> 00:13:59.160
I think, can the family read the prescription?

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.343
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy?

00:14:01.343 --> 00:14:03.793
Do they have food to take with the prescription?

00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:06.043
Do they have insurance to fill the prescription?

00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:08.726
Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads,

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:10.476
not in medical school."

00:14:10.476 --> 00:14:12.460
Now none of these solutions --

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.430
the prescription pad, the electronic medical record,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.577
the waiting room,

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:17.745
the army of college students --

00:14:17.745 --> 00:14:18.928
are perfect.

00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:21.428
But they are ours for the taking --

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:22.760
simple examples

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.261
of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.176
that, if we reclaimed and redeployed,

00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:32.593
could realize our most basic aspiration

00:14:32.593 --> 00:14:34.377
of healthcare.

00:14:34.377 --> 00:14:37.593
So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months

00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:40.326
when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:43.260
And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.679
that I needed to leave.

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.642
And I was so nervous,

00:14:45.642 --> 00:14:48.176
because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me

00:14:48.176 --> 00:14:51.226
for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:53.210
And I sat down with him and I said,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.093
"Jeff, I have this idea

00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:57.512
that we could mobilize college students

00:14:57.512 --> 00:15:00.446
to address patients' most basic health needs."

00:15:00.446 --> 00:15:02.027
And I'll be honest,

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.326
all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.

00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:06.793
But he said this,

00:15:06.793 --> 00:15:10.141
"Rebecca, when you have a vision,

00:15:10.141 --> 00:15:13.992
you have an obligation to realize that vision.

00:15:13.992 --> 00:15:17.093
You must pursue that vision."

00:15:17.093 --> 00:15:20.359
And I have to say, I was like "Whoa.

00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:22.376
That's a lot of pressure."

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:23.775
I just wanted a blessing,

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:25.326
I didn't want some kind of mandate.

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:26.893
But the truth is

00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:29.676
I've spent every waking minute nearly since then

00:15:29.676 --> 00:15:31.460
chasing that vision.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.642
I believe that we all have a vision

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.543
for healthcare in this country.

00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:38.742
I believe that at the end of the day

00:15:38.742 --> 00:15:40.576
when we measure our healthcare,

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:43.392
it will not be by the diseases cured,

00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:45.910
but by the diseases prevented.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.927
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies

00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:51.427
or the sophistication of our specialists,

00:15:51.427 --> 00:15:54.226
but by how rarely we needed them.

00:15:54.226 --> 00:15:55.710
And most of all,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.227
I believe that when we measure healthcare,

00:15:58.227 --> 00:16:00.910
it will be, not by what the system was,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.676
but by what we chose it to be.

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:04.743
Thank you.

00:16:04.743 --> 00:16:14.993
(Applause)

00:16:14.993 --> 00:16:16.260
Thank you.

00:16:16.268 --> 00:16:25.591
(Applause)
