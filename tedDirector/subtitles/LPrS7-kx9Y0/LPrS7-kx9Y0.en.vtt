00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.531
Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:18.589
My job is that I lie to children,

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.605
but they're honest lies.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.373
I write children's books,

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:25.601
and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.787
"We all know that Art is not truth.

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:32.429
Art is a lie that makes us realize truth

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.127
or at least the truth that is 
given us to understand.

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:37.237
The artist must know the manner whereby

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:42.074
to convince others of the 
truthfulness of his lies."

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.932
I first heard this when I was a kid,

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:46.623
and I loved it,

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:49.415
but I had no idea what it meant.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.992
(Laughter)

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:52.889
So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.508
to talk to you today about, though,

00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:56.721
truth and lies, fiction and reality.

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.573
So how could I untangle

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:01.100
this knotted bunch of sentences?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.527
And I said, I've got PowerPoint.
Let's do a Venn diagram.

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:07.020
["Truth. Lies."]
(Laughter)

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780
So there it is, right there, boom.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.485
We've got truth and lies

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:11.557
and then there's this little space,

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.118
the edge, in the middle.

00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:19.918
That liminal space, that's art.

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:24.915
All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:27.941
But that's actually not very helpful either.

00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:32.316
The thing that made me understand

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:34.806
that quote and really kind of what art,

00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:37.023
at least the art of fiction, was,

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:38.463
was working with kids.

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:40.723
I used to be a summer camp counselor.

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:43.010
I would do it on my summers off from college,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.389
and I loved it.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.148
It was a sports summer camp

00:01:48.148 --> 00:01:49.982
for four- to six-year-olds.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:51.628
I was in charge of the four-year-olds,

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:53.431
which is good, because

00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.780
four-year-olds can't play 
sports, and neither can I.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.355
(Laughter)

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:01.280
I play sports at a four-year-old level,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.997
so what would happen is the kids would

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:06.696
dribble around some cones, and then got hot,

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:08.959
and then they would go sit underneath the tree

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.804
where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:14.349
and I would just make up stories and tell them to them

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.168
and I would tell them stories about my life.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.911
I would tell them about how, on the weekends,

00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:21.126
I would go home and I would
spy for the Queen of England.

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:24.447
And soon, other kids

00:02:24.447 --> 00:02:26.287
who weren't even in my group of kids,

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:27.756
they would come up to me, and they would say,

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.668
"You're Mac Barnett, right?

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:32.737
You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:35.959
And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.389
to come up and ask me that question.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.662
In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:41.899
but, you know, four-year-olds —

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:46.528
you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.

00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:50.956
And I realized that the stories that I was telling

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:54.453
were real in this way that was familiar to me

00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:55.658
and really exciting.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:57.864
I think the pinnacle of this for 
me — I'll never forget this —

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:00.687
there was this little girl 
named Riley. She was tiny,

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:03.126
and she used to always take 
out her lunch every day

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:05.466
and she would throw out her fruit.

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:06.874
She would just take her fruit,

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.222
her mom packed her a melon every day,

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:09.971
and she would just throw it in the ivy

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.284
and then she would eat fruit snacks

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:14.657
and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:17.713
you can't do that, you 
have to eat the fruit."

00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:19.530
And she was like, "Why?"

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.362
And I was like, "Well, when
you throw the fruit in the ivy,

00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:25.254
pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"

00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:27.256
which is why I think I ended up

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:32.875
telling stories to children and not
being a nutritionist for children.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:34.763
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:35.863
That's not going to happen."

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.914
And so, on the last day of camp,

00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:41.367
I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.393
from the grocery store

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.495
and I hid it in the ivy,

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:46.946
and then at lunchtime, I was like,

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:49.621
"Riley, why don't you go over
there and see what you've done."

00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:52.796
And — (Laughter) —

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.474
she went trudging through 
the ivy, and then her eyes

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:57.566
just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.680
that was bigger than her head,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.650
and then all the kids ran over 
there and rushed around her,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.237
and one of the kids was like, "Hey,

00:04:04.237 --> 00:04:06.126
why is there a sticker on this?"

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:09.350
(Laughter)

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.819
And I was like, "That is also why I say

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.811
do not throw your stickers in the ivy.

00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:20.283
Put them in the trash can. It
ruins nature when you do this."

00:04:20.283 --> 00:04:25.633
And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:27.661
and she was so proud.

00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:32.505
And Riley knew she didn't 
grow a melon in seven days,

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.441
but she also knew that she did,

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.657
and it's a weird place,

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:40.402
but it's not just a place that kids can get to.

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:43.934
It's anything. Art can get us to that place.

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.891
She was right in that place in the middle,

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:49.316
that place which you could call art or fiction.

00:04:49.316 --> 00:04:51.381
I'm going to call it wonder.

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:54.010
It's what Coleridge called the
willing suspension of disbelief

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.690
or poetic faith,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.100
for those moments where a
story, no matter how strange,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.140
has some semblance of the truth,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.117
and then you're able to believe it.

00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:03.747
It's not just kids who can get there.

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:06.436
Adults can too, and we get there when we read.

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.686
It's why in two days, people will be

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:12.220
descending on Dublin to take the walking tour

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.825
of Bloomsday and see everything
that happened in "Ulysses,"

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:20.080
even though none of that happened.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.337
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street

00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:23.809
to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.936
even though 221B is just a number that was painted

00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:29.082
on a building that never 
actually had that address.

00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:30.807
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:33.427
but we have real feelings about them,

00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:34.471
and we're able to do that.

00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:36.364
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:36.364 --> 00:05:39.682
and yet we also know that they are.

00:05:39.682 --> 00:05:43.338
Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,

00:05:43.338 --> 00:05:44.891
and that's why I love writing for kids.

00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.871
I think kids are the best audience

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:51.260
for serious literary fiction.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.084
When I was a kid,

00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:56.710
I was obsessed with secret door novels,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.871
things like "Narnia,"

00:05:57.871 --> 00:06:01.574
where you would open a wardrobe
and go through to a magical land.

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:04.304
And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist

00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:06.332
and I would look for them and try to go through them.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:10.076
I wanted to live and cross over into 
that fictional world, which is —

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:15.771
I would always just open people's closet doors. 
(Laughter)

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.548
I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,

00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:20.798
and there was not a secret magical land there.

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:23.386
There was some other weird stuff that
I think my mom should know about.

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:25.107
(Laughter)

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:29.272
And I was happy to tell her all about it.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:35.683
After college, my first job was working

00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:38.231
behind one of these secret doors.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.188
This is a place called 826 Valencia.

00:06:40.188 --> 00:06:42.280
It's at 826 Valencia Street

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.766
in the Mission in San Francisco,

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:46.792
and when I worked there, there
was a publishing company

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:49.431
headquartered there called McSweeney's,

00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.585
a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:54.790
but then the front of it

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.360
was a strange shop.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.787
You see, this place was zoned retail,

00:06:57.787 --> 00:07:00.903
and in San Francisco, they were
not going to give us a variance,

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:03.790
and so the writer who founded
it, a writer named Dave Eggers,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.129
to come into compliance 
with code, he said, "Fine,

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.505
I'm just going to build a pirate supply store."

00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:13.583
And that's what he did. (Laughter)

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:15.534
And it's beautiful. It's all wood.

00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:17.464
There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus

00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:20.483
so you don't get scurvy.

00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:22.631
They have eyepatches in lots of colors,

00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:25.331
because when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.

00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:29.674
You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:31.670
Or eyes, also in lots of colors,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.475
just glass eyes, depending on how you want

00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:37.187
to deal with that situation.

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:40.312
And the store, strangely,

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:44.324
people came to them and bought things,

00:07:44.324 --> 00:07:46.151
and they ended up paying the rent

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:48.215
for our tutoring center, which was behind it,

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:51.267
but to me, more important was the fact

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:53.918
that I think the quality of work you do,

00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:56.404
kids would come and get instruction in writing,

00:07:56.404 --> 00:08:00.670
and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,
fictional space like this to go do your writing,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.420
it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.607
It's a secret door that you can walk through.

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:09.358
So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,

00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:12.840
and it was my job to build the store down there.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.400
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.240
That's our motto: "Whenever
you are, we're already then."

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.100
(Laughter)

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.857
And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:29.967
Our friendly staff is ready to help you.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.110
They're from all eras,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.719
including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:37.916
he's from the very recent past.

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:39.618
There's our Employees of the Month,

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:42.604
including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.

00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:45.596
Some great people have come up through our ranks.

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:47.947
This is our kind of pharmacy section.

00:08:47.947 --> 00:08:49.286
We have some patent medicines,

00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:51.637
Canopic jars for your organs,

00:08:51.637 --> 00:08:53.271
communist soap that says,

00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.722
"This is your soap for the year."
(Laughter)

00:08:57.722 --> 00:08:59.938
Our slushy machine broke

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:02.571
on the opening night and 
we didn't know what to do.

00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:04.810
Our architect was covered in red syrup.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.284
It looked like he had just murdered somebody,

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:08.971
which it was not out of the question

00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.021
for this particular architect,

00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:12.607
and we didn't know what to do.

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:13.639
It was going to be the highlight of our store.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.984
So we just put that sign on it that said,

00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:19.489
"Out of order. Come back yesterday."
(Laughter)

00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:21.525
And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:25.621
so we just left it there forever.

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.934
Mammoth Chunks. These things
weigh, like, seven pounds each.

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:32.134
Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad

00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:36.712
and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.

00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:38.670
Dead languages.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.370
(Laughter)

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.450
Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.590
And Viking Odorant, which
comes in lots of great scents:

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.595
toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.703
Because we believe that Axe Body Spray

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:55.366
is something that you should
only find on the battlefield,

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:59.560
not under your arms.
(Laughter)

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.544
And these are robot emotion chips,

00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:03.771
so robots can feel love or fear.

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:05.481
Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,

00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:06.782
which we did not expect.

00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:07.793
(Laughter)

00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:10.240
We did not think that was going to happen.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.501
But there's a nonprofit behind it,

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:14.481
and kids go through a door
that says "Employees Only"

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.696
and they end up in this space

00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:17.870
where they do homework and write stories

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.330
and make films and this is a book release party

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.814
where kids will read.

00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:23.716
There's a quarterly that's published

00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:25.145
with just writing that's done by the kids

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:26.202
who come every day after school,

00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:27.730
and we have release parties

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.677
and they eat cake and read for their parents

00:10:30.677 --> 00:10:33.529
and drink milk out of champagne glasses.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:36.777
And it's a very special space,

00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:39.996
because it's this weird space in the front.

00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:43.295
The joke isn't a joke.

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:45.695
You can't find the seams on the fiction,

00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:48.603
and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction

00:10:48.603 --> 00:10:51.865
that's colonized the real world.

00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:55.922
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:58.162
There's a term called metafiction,

00:10:58.162 --> 00:11:02.245
and that's just stories about stories,

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.820
and meta's having a moment now.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.845
Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s

00:11:05.845 --> 00:11:08.522
with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,

00:11:08.522 --> 00:11:09.770
but it's been around.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.311
It's almost as old as storytelling itself.

00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:15.851
And one metafictive technique

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:17.645
is breaking the fourth wall. Right?

00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:20.895
It's when an actor will turn to the audience

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:21.961
and say, "I am an actor,

00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:24.552
these are just rafters."

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.577
And even that supposedly honest moment,

00:11:26.577 --> 00:11:28.803
I would argue, is in service of the lie,

00:11:28.803 --> 00:11:31.559
but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.246
of the fiction.

00:11:33.246 --> 00:11:35.395
For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.529
If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.872
I want fiction to escape

00:11:39.872 --> 00:11:41.955
and come into the real world.

00:11:41.955 --> 00:11:46.554
I want a book to be a secret door that opens

00:11:46.554 --> 00:11:49.446
and lets the stories out into reality.

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:52.427
And so I try to do this in my books.

00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:53.970
And here's just one example.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.892
This is the first book that I ever made.

00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.513
It's called "Billy Twitters
and his Blue Whale Problem."

00:11:58.513 --> 00:12:00.643
And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet

00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:02.229
but it's a punishment

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:04.704
and it ruins his life.

00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:07.516
So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:10.106
(Laughter)

00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:12.100
And he has to take it to school with him.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.454
He lives in San Francisco —

00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:15.985
very tough city to own a blue whale in.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:20.419
A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:22.927
This market's crazy, everybody.

00:12:22.927 --> 00:12:26.718
But underneath the jacket is this case,

00:12:26.718 --> 00:12:30.904
and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,

00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.284
and there's an ad

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:35.527
that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial

00:12:35.527 --> 00:12:37.426
for a blue whale.

00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:40.420
And you can just send in a
self-addressed stamped envelope

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.270
and we'll send you a whale.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.610
And kids do write in.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.018
So here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,

00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:55.199
I bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:57.676
Eliot Gannon (age 6)."

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:01.350
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:04.960
So what Eliot and the other kids

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.451
who send these in get back

00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:10.376
is a letter in very small print
from a Norwegian law firm —

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:14.337
(Laughter) —

00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:17.698
that says that due to a change in customs laws,

00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:19.905
their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:21.129
which is a very lovely fjord,

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:22.593
and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.073
and Norwegian food for 
a little while. It digresses.

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:26.855
(Laughter)

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.680
But it finishes off by saying that

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.414
your whale would love to hear from you.

00:13:33.414 --> 00:13:35.000
He's got a phone number,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.714
and you can call and leave him a message.

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:42.290
And when you call and leave him a message,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.281
you just, on the outgoing message,

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:49.399
it's just whale sounds and then a beep,

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:52.954
which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.

00:13:52.954 --> 00:13:54.934
And they get a picture of their whale too.

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:57.465
So this is Randolph,

00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:00.806
and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:05.088
who was one of the first kids to ever call in,

00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:07.398
and I'll play you some of Nico's message.

00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:11.530
This is the first message I ever got from Nico.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.769
(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:17.803
I am your owner, Randolph. Hello.

00:14:17.803 --> 00:14:21.279
So this is the first time I can ever talk to you,

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:27.523
and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.

00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:30.110
Mac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.360
(Laughter)

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.297
And here's another one of Nico's messages.

00:14:36.297 --> 00:14:39.840
(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.993
I haven't talked to you for a long time,

00:14:44.993 --> 00:14:49.688
but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.938
yeah, Saturday or Sunday,

00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:54.953
so now I'm calling you again

00:14:54.953 --> 00:14:59.869
to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,

00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:02.805
and I'm going to probably call you again

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:04.988
tomorrow or today,

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:09.184
so I'll talk to you later. Bye.

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:13.492
MB: So he did, he called back that day again.

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:17.373
He's left over 25 messages for Randolph

00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:20.125
over four years.

00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:22.216
You find out all about him

00:15:22.216 --> 00:15:23.852
and the grandma that he loves

00:15:23.852 --> 00:15:26.207
and the grandma that 
he likes a little bit less —

00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:28.400
(Laughter) —

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.827
and the crossword puzzles that he does,

00:15:30.827 --> 00:15:34.607
and this is — I'll play you one 
more message from Nico.

00:15:34.607 --> 00:15:37.910
This is the Christmas message from Nico.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.273
[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.528
sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.

00:15:43.528 --> 00:15:46.194
It's just that I've been so busy

00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:48.893
because school started,

00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:51.926
as you might not know, probably,

00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:55.807
since you're a whale, you don't know,

00:15:55.807 --> 00:16:00.487
and I'm calling you to just say,

00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:04.177
to wish you a merry Christmas.

00:16:04.177 --> 00:16:08.778
So have a nice Christmas,

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:15.651
and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.

00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:17.175
MB: I actually got Nico,

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:20.306
I hadn't heard from in 18 months,

00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:24.424
and he just left a message two days ago.

00:16:24.424 --> 00:16:26.850
His voice is completely different,

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.350
but he put his babysitter on the phone,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.211
and she was very nice to Randolph as well.

00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:38.561
But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.

00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:42.287
I would want anyone I was writing for

00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:44.428
to be in that place emotionally

00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:46.664
with the things that I create.

00:16:46.664 --> 00:16:50.365
I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,

00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:53.960
and they deserve the best stories we can give them.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.162
Thank you very much.

00:16:56.162 --> 00:16:58.817
(Applause)
