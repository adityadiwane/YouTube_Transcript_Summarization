00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I wanted to visualize the story of life.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But there were also revelations.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the way it was three billion years ago,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
back before the sky turned blue.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There's stromatolites down there --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the first living things to capture photosynthesis --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and it's the only place they still occur today.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Going down there was like entering a time capsule,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is what we all breathe today.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's a story about you and me, nature and science.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
a short, brief journey of life through time.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
solidifying into surface, molded by fire.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The moon was closer; things were different.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It arises around cracks in the Earth.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Growing living structures under an alien sky ...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And they changed the atmosphere.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
A breath that's fossilized now as iron.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Life needs a membrane to contain itself

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
so it can replicate and mutate.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
with skeletons of silicon ...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
circuit boards of the future.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
into more complex forms.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It grew as light and oxygen increased.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Life hardened and became defensive.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
among the first to leave the sea.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
True land plants arose, leafless at first.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The fundamental forms of ferns followed,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Life flourished in swamps.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It took time for life to break away from water,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and it still beckons all the time.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And the dragons that arose are still among us today.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the center of Brazil,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And others fly today like echoes of the past.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
In birds, life gained new mobility.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Water lilies were among the first.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
When the skies cleared, a new world was born.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
tenrecs, accustomed to the dark.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
New forms became bats. Civets.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Grasslands created opportunities.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Herd safety came with sharpened senses.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Some mammals turned back to water.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
becoming lemurs not much later.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
We're molded by the same life force.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The blood veins in our hands

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And our brains -- our celebrated brains --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Mars is still not very far.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and vice versa.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Applause)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Thank you. Thank you.
