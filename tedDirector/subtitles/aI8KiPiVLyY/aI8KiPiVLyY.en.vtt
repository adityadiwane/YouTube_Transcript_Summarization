00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.429
How many people here have heard of PMS?

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.915
Everybody, right?

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.399
Everyone knows that women
go a little crazy

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.270
right before they get their period,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.458
that the menstrual cycle throws them
onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.151
of irrationality and irritability.

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.939
There's a general assumption

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:37.858
that fluctuations in reproductive hormones
cause extreme emotions

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:41.391
and that the great majority of women
are affected by this.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:44.150
Well, I am here to tell you
that scientific evidence says

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.569
neither of those assumptions is true.

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.792
I'm here to give you 
the good news about PMS.

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:54.242
But first, let's take a look
at how firmly the idea of PMS

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.634
is entrenched in American culture.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:01:00.210
If you examine newspaper
or magazine articles,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.552
you'll see how widely assumed it is
that everyone gets PMS.

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:09.940
In an article in the magazine Redbook
titled "You: PMS Free,"

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.520
readers were informed that between 80 
to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.251
L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers

00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.525
that 40 to 50 percent of women
suffer from PMS,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:26.169
and that it plays a major role
in women's mental and physical health,

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:29.160
and a couple of years ago,
even the Wall Street Journal

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.345
ran an article on calcium
as a treatment for PMS,

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:34.400
asking its female readers,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.489
"Do you turn into a witch every month?"

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.866
From all these articles, you would think
there must be a mountain of research

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.790
verifying the widespread nature of PMS.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.948
However, after five decades of research,

00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:52.019
there's no strong consensus
on the definition, the cause,

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.160
the treatment, or even 
the existence of PMS.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.313
As most commonly defined by psychologists,

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:04.282
PMS involves negative behavioral,
cognitive and physical symptoms

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:07.208
from the time of ovulation
to menstruation.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.420
But here's where it gets tricky.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.661
Over 150 different symptoms
have been used to diagnose PMS,

00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.751
and here are just a few of those.

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:18.632
Now, I want to be clear here.

00:02:18.632 --> 00:02:21.998
I'm not saying women don't get
some of these symptoms.

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:24.622
What I'm saying is that
getting some of these symptoms

00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:27.501
doesn't amount to a mental disorder,

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.822
and when psychologists
come up with a disorder

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.108
that's so vaguely defined,

00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:36.591
the label eventually becomes meaningless.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.563
With a list of symptoms
this long and wide,

00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:42.326
I could have PMS, you could have PMS,

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:44.880
the guy in the third row here
could have PMS,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.573
my dog could have PMS.
(Laughter)

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.861
Some researchers said
you had to have five symptoms.

00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:52.426
Some said three.

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:55.282
Other researchers said that symptoms
were only meaningful

00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:57.116
if they were highly disturbing to you,

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.669
but others said minor symptoms
were just as important.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.571
For many years, because
there was no standardization

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:05.660
in the definition of PMS,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.725
when psychologists tried
to report prevalence rates,

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:11.512
their estimates ranged
from five percent of women

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:13.810
to 97 percent of women,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.638
so at the same time almost no one
and almost everyone had PMS.

00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:26.330
Overall, the weaknesses in the methods
of research on PMS have been considerable.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.967
First, many studies asked women
to report their symptoms retrospectively,

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:34.684
looking to the past and relying on memory,

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:37.865
which is known to inflate reporting of PMS

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:41.230
compared to what's called
prospective reporting,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.426
which involves keeping
a daily log of symptoms

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:45.864
for at least two months in a row.

00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:50.833
Many studies also exclusively focused
on white, middle-class women,

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:55.479
which makes it problematic
to apply study findings to all women.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.517
We know there's a strong
cultural component to the belief in PMS

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:03.139
because it's nearly unheard of
outside of Western nations.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.400
Third, many studies failed
to use control groups.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.210
If we want to understand
the specific characteristics

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.730
of women who have PMS,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.932
we need to be able to compare them
to women who don't have PMS.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:19.160
And finally, many different types
of questionnaires were used

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.170
to diagnose PMS, focusing
on different symptoms,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.823
symptom duration and severity.

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:28.934
To do reliable research on any condition,

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.883
scientists must agree
on the specific characteristics

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:33.636
that make up that condition

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.749
so they're all talking
about the same thing,

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.185
and with PMS, this has not been the case.

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:41.461
However, in 1994,

00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:45.129
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders,

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.428
known as the DSM, thankfully --

00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:51.306
it's also the manual
for mental health professionals --

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:55.230
they redefined PMS as PMDD,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.248
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.

00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:04.192
And dysphoria refers to
a feeling of agitation or unease.

00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:07.652
And according to these new DSM guidelines,

00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:10.879
in most menstrual cycles in the last year,

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.130
at least five of 11 possible symptoms

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.822
must appear in the week
before menstruation starts;

00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:21.189
the symptoms must improve
once menstruation has begun;

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.931
and the symptoms must be absent
the week after menstruation has ended.

00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.429
One of these symptoms must come
from this list of four:

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.677
marked mood swings, irritability,
anxiety, or depression.

00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:38.509
The other symptoms could come
from the first slide

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.646
or from those on the second slide,

00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:43.269
including symptoms like
feeling out of control

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:46.938
and changes in sleep or appetite.

00:05:46.938 --> 00:05:50.815
The DSM also required now
that the symptoms

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:54.995
should be associated with
clinically significant distress --

00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:57.828
there should be some kind
of disturbance in work

00:05:57.828 --> 00:06:00.753
or school or social relationships --

00:06:00.753 --> 00:06:04.259
and that symptoms and symptom severity
should now be documented

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.276
by keeping a daily log
for at least two cycles in a row.

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:12.131
And finally, the DSM required that
the emotional disturbance

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:17.889
should be more than simply an exacerbation
of an already existing disorder.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.675
So scientifically speaking,
this is an improvement.

00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:23.322
We now have a limited number of symptoms,

00:06:23.322 --> 00:06:26.898
and a high impact on functioning
that's required,

00:06:26.898 --> 00:06:32.354
and the reporting and timing of symptoms
have both become very specific.

00:06:32.354 --> 00:06:35.164
Well, using this criteria

00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:37.310
and looking at most recent studies,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.925
we see that on average,

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:44.890
three to eight percent of women
suffer from PMDD.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.470
Not all women, not most women,

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.240
not the majority of women,
not even a lot of women:

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.926
three to eight percent.

00:06:52.926 --> 00:06:57.883
For everyone else, variables
like stressful events or happy occasions

00:06:57.883 --> 00:06:59.927
or even day of the week

00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:04.012
are more powerful predictors of mood
than time of the month,

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:07.452
and this is the information
the scientific community has had

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:08.982
since the 1990s.

00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:11.722
In 2002, my colleagues and I
published an article

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:14.856
describing the PMS and PMDD research,

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:19.129
and several similar articles have appeared
in psychology journals.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.540
The questions is, why hasn't this
information trickled down to the public?

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.116
Why do these myths persist?

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:30.413
Well, certainly the onslaught
of messages that women receive

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:35.557
from books, TV, movies, the Internet,
that everyone gets PMS

00:07:35.557 --> 00:07:39.190
go a long way in convincing them
it must be true.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.360
Research tells us that the more
a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.268
the more likely she is
to erroneously report that she has it.

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.544
Let me tell you what I mean
by "erroneously."

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:53.270
You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.613
and she says yes,

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:57.031
but then, when you have her 
keep a daily log

00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.430
of psychological symptoms for two months,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.704
no correlation is found
between her symptoms

00:08:02.704 --> 00:08:04.496
and time of the month.

00:08:05.016 --> 00:08:09.385
Another reason for
the persistence of the PMS myth

00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:12.846
has to do with the narrow boundaries
of the feminine role.

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:15.494
Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:19.486
have suggested that
taking on the label of PMS

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:24.919
allows women to express emotions that
would otherwise be considered unladylike.

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:28.310
The near universal definition
of a good woman

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.838
is one who is happy, loving,
caring for others,

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:34.694
and taking great satisfaction
from that role.

00:08:34.694 --> 00:08:39.846
Well, PMS has become a permission slip
to be angry, complain, be irritated,

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:43.214
without losing the title of good woman.

00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:47.254
We know that the variables
in a woman's environment

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:50.714
are much more likely to cause her
to be angry than her hormones,

00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:53.570
but when she attributes anger to hormones,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.337
she's absolved
of responsibility or criticism.

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:59.790
"Oh, that's not who she is.
It's out of her control."

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:06.406
And while this can be a useful tool,
it serves to invalidate women's emotions.

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:09.127
When people respond to a woman's anger

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:12.122
with the thought, "Oh,
it's just that time of the month,"

00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:17.480
her ability to be taken seriously
or effect change is severely limited.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.467
So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:23.511
Well, I can tell you that treating PMS

00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:27.992
has become a profitable, 
thriving industry.

00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:34.772
Amazon.com currently offers
over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.

00:09:34.772 --> 00:09:37.233
A quick Google search
will bring up a cornucopia

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:40.971
of clinics, workshops and seminars.

00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:43.874
Reputable Internet sources
of medical information

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:48.634
like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic
list PMS as a known disorder.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:51.141
It's not a known disorder,
but they list it.

00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:55.112
And they also list the medications that
physicians have prescribed to treat it,

00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:58.048
like anti-depressants or hormones.

00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:03.772
Interestingly, though, both websites
say that the success of medication

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:07.859
in treating PMS symptoms
vary from woman to woman.

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:09.590
Well, that doesn't make sense.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.224
If you've got a distinct disorder
with a distinct cause,

00:10:12.224 --> 00:10:14.174
which PMS is supposed to be,

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:17.982
then the treatment should bring
improvement for a great number of women.

00:10:17.982 --> 00:10:20.536
This has not been the case
with these treatments,

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:24.646
and FDA regulations say that
for a drug to be deemed effective,

00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:26.713
a large portion of the target population

00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.871
should see clinically
significant improvement.

00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:33.887
So we have not had that at all
with these so-called treatments.

00:10:33.887 --> 00:10:38.200
However, the financial gain
of perpetuating the myth

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.201
that PMS is a common mental disorder

00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:45.270
and is treatable is quite substantial.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.724
When women are prescribed
drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,

00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:53.833
medical protocol requires that they have
physician follow-up every three months.

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.806
That's a lot of doctor visits.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:58.314
Pharmaceutical companies
reap untold profits

00:10:58.314 --> 00:11:02.238
when women are convinced
they should take a prescribed medication

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:05.140
for all of their child-bearing lives.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.764
Over-the-counter drugs like Midol

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:12.176
even claim to treat PMS symptoms
like tension and irritability,

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:16.169
even though they only contain
a diuretic, a pain reliever

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:18.143
and caffeine.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:21.579
Now, far be it from me to argue
with the magical powers of caffeine,

00:11:21.579 --> 00:11:25.944
but I don't think reducing tension
is one of them.

00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:32.510
Since 2002, Midol has marketed
a Teen Midol to adolescents.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.340
They are aiming at young girls early,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.585
to convince them that everyone gets PMS
and that it will make you a monster,

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.864
but wait, there's something
you can do about it:

00:11:41.864 --> 00:11:44.926
Take Midol and you will be
a human being again.

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:51.450
In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars
in sales revenue.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.100
So while perpetuating the myth of PMS
has been lucrative for some,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.320
it comes with some serious
adverse consequences for women.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.874
First, it contributes
to the medicalization

00:12:02.874 --> 00:12:05.544
of women's reproductive health.

00:12:05.544 --> 00:12:08.748
The medical field has a long history
of conceptualizing

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:14.158
women's reproductive processes
as illnesses that require treatment,

00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:18.268
and this has come at many costs,
including excessive Cesarean deliveries,

00:12:18.268 --> 00:12:20.978
hysterectomies and prescribed
hormone treatments

00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:25.005
that have harmed rather than enhanced
women's health.

00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:30.505
Second, the PMS myth also contributes
to the stereotype of women

00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:33.871
as irrational and overemotional.

00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:37.610
When the menstrual cycle is described
as a hormonal roller coaster

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.430
that turns women into angry beasts,

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.775
it becomes easy to question 
the competence of all women.

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:47.594
Women have made tremendous strides
in the workforce,

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:51.657
but still there's a minuscule number
of women at the highest echelons

00:12:51.657 --> 00:12:54.397
of fields like government or business,

00:12:54.397 --> 00:12:59.343
and when we think about
who makes for a good CEO or senator,

00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:04.462
someone who has qualities like 
rationality, steadiness, competence

00:13:04.462 --> 00:13:05.971
come to mind,

00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:09.512
and in our culture, that sounds more
like a man than a woman,

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:13.170
and the PMS myth contributes to that.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.339
Psychologists know that
the moods of men and women

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:19.172
are more similar than different.

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:23.235
One study followed men and women
for four to six months

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:26.300
and found that the number
of mood swings they experienced

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.154
and the severity of those mood swings
were no different.

00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:34.357
And finally, the PMS myth
keeps women from dealing

00:13:34.357 --> 00:13:38.374
with the actual issues
causing them emotional upset.

00:13:38.374 --> 00:13:42.799
Individual issues like
quality of relationship or work conditions

00:13:42.809 --> 00:13:47.313
or societal issues like racism or sexism
or the daily grind of poverty

00:13:47.313 --> 00:13:50.657
are all strongly related to daily mood.

00:13:50.657 --> 00:13:54.420
Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.272
keeps women from understanding
the source of their negative emotions,

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:03.640
but it also takes away the opportunity
to take any action to change them.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.469
So the good news about PMS

00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:11.205
is that while some women get some symptoms
because of the menstrual cycle,

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:14.758
the great majority don't
get a mental disorder.

00:14:14.758 --> 00:14:17.985
They go to work or school,
take care of their families,

00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:20.284
and function at a normal level.

00:14:20.284 --> 00:14:23.511
We know the emotions and moods
of men and women

00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:25.462
are more similar than different,

00:14:25.462 --> 00:14:31.082
so let's walk away from
the tired old PMS myth of women as witches

00:14:31.097 --> 00:14:35.945
and embrace the reality of high emotional
and professional functioning

00:14:35.945 --> 00:14:39.149
the great majority of women
live every day.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.425
Thank you.

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:43.537
(Applause)
