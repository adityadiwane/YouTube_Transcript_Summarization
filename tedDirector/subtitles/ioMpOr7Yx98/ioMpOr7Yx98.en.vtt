00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
PM: Oh.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
is trying to figure out what is going to happen.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And none of this pin stuff would have happened

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I'll tell you what happened.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
and it was after the Gulf War,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and I was an instructed ambassador.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And the cease-fire had been translated

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
into a series of sanctions resolutions,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and my instructions

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
comparing me to many things,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
but among them an "unparalleled serpent."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And so I happened to have a snake pin.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
(Laughter)

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
And when I went out to meet the press,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And then I thought, well this is fun.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
that would, in fact, reflect

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
what I thought we were going to do on any given day.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So that's how it all started.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
PM: So how large is the collection?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
MA: Pretty big.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
It's now traveling.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
At the moment it's in Indianapolis,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but it was at the Smithsonian.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
(Laughter)

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
PM: So is this a good idea.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I remember when you were the first woman

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
as Secretary of State,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and there was a lot of conversation always

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
about what you were wearing,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
how you looked --

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
the thing that happens to a lot of women,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
especially if they're the first in a position.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So how do you feel about that -- the whole --

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
What was interesting was that,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Go out and look like a diplomat."

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
But still, there were all kinds of questions

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
And one of the things --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and she got criticized over that.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
finding our ways of defining our roles,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and shape the future.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
How did you handle that balance

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
between being the tough diplomatic

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and strong voice of this country

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to the rest of the world

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
and also how you felt about yourself

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
and so how did you handle that?

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
a few minutes after I'd been named.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
So it evolved.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
(Laughter)

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
But basically I love being a woman.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And so what happened --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and I think there will probably be some people in the audience

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that will identify with this --

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and that's when this all started,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
because that is a very male organization.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
so 14 men sat there staring at me,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and I thought -- well you know how we all are.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
You want to get the feeling of the room,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and "do people like me?"

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
and "will I really say something intelligent?"

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and if I don't speak today

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
then the voice of the United States will not be heard,"

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and it was the first time that I had that feeling

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
that I had to step out of myself

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
in my normal, reluctant female mode

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
And so that happened more at various times,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.260
but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to being a woman.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
I think we are a lot better

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
at personal relationships,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
and then have the capability obviously

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
of telling it like it is when it's necessary.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
when she turned seven last year,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
said to her mother, my daughter,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Only girls are Secretary of State."

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
(Laughter)

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:59.260
(Applause)

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
PM: What a change that is.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
As you travel now all over the world,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
which you do frequently,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
how do you assess

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
this global narrative around the story of women and girls?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Where are we?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
MA: I think we're slowly changing,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
but obviously there are whole pockets

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
in countries where nothing is different.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And therefore it means that we have to remember

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
that, while many of us have had huge opportunities --

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is that there are a lot of women

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that are not capable

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
of worrying and taking care of themselves

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and understanding that women have to help other women.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And so what I have felt --

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
and I have looked at this

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
from a national security issue --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
when I was Secretary of State, I decided

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
not just because I'm a feminist,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.260
but because I believe that societies are better off

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
when women are politically and economically empowered,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that values are passed down,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
the health situation is better,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
education is better,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
there is greater economic prosperity.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So I think that it behooves us --

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
those of us that live in various countries

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
where we do have economic and political voice --

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
that we need to help other women.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And I really dedicated myself to that,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
PM: And did you get pushback

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
MA: From some people.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
The bottom line that I decided

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
was actually women's issues are the hardest issues,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
because they are the ones that have to do with life and death

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
in so many aspects,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and because, as I said,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
it is really central to the way that we think about things.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
Now for instance,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
some of the wars that took place

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
when I was in office,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
For instance, when I started,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
there were wars in the Balkans.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
The women in Bosnia were being raped.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
was, I had just arrived at the U.N.,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Now there are 192.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
So I said to my assistant,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
"Invite the other women permanent representatives."

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
that there'd be a lot of women there.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So the countries that had women representatives

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Lichtenstein and me.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
(Laughter)

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And so we set it up,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
and we called ourselves the G7.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
(Laughter)

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And we lobbied

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
on behalf of women's issues.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
So we managed to get two women judges

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
on this war crimes tribunal.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And then what happened

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
that it was against humanity.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.260
(Applause)

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
PM: So when you look around the world

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and you see that, in many cases --

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
certainly in the Western world --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
women are evolving into more leadership positions,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
and even other places

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.260
some barriers are being brought down,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
but there's still so much violence,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
still so many problems,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and yet we hear there are more women

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
at the negotiating tables.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Now you were at those negotiating tables

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
when they weren't, when there was maybe you --

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
one voice, maybe one or two others.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
Do you believe, and can you tell us why,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
there is going to be a significant shift

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
in things like violence

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
and peace and conflict and resolution

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
on a sustainable basis?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.260
that the tone of the conversation changes,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
and also the goals of the conversation change.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
But it doesn't mean that the whole world

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
would be a lot better

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
if it were totally run by women.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
If you think that, you've forgotten high school.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
(Laughter)

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
But the bottom line

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
is that there is a way,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
when there are more women at the table,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
that there's an attempt

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
to develop some understanding.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
to talk about some of the problems

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
that had taken place in Rwanda.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
And so I think the capability of women

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
to put themselves --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and having more empathy.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
I think it helps in terms of the support

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
if there are other women in the room.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
When I was Secretary of State,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And so it was nice when one of them would show up.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
For instance, she is now the president of Finland,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
And it was really terrific.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Because one of the things I think you'll understand.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
We went to a meeting,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and the men in my delegation,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and she said, "Well I feel we should do this."

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
But I think it really does help

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
to have a critical mass of women

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
in a series of foreign policy positions.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The other thing that I think is really important:

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
A lot of national security policy

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
isn't just about foreign policy,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
but it's about budgets, military budgets,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
and how the debts of countries work out.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
So if you have women

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
in a variety of foreign policy posts,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
they can support each other

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
PM: So how do we get

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
More women's voices at the table?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
More men who believe

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
that the balance is best?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
MA: Well I think one of the things --

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
I'm chairman of the board of an organization

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
called the National Democratic Institute

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
that works to support women candidates.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I think that we need

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
to help in other countries

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
to train women

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
to be in political office,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
to figure out how they can in fact

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
develop political voices.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
I think we also need to be supportive

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260
when businesses are being created

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
and just make sure that women help each other.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Now I have a saying

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
that I feel very strongly about,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
because I am of a certain age

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
where, when I started in my career,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
or "Aren't your children suffering

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
because you're not there all the time?"

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.260
In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And so I think what needs to happen

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
is we need to help each other.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
for women who don't help each other.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:42.260
(Applause)

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Thank you for joining us today.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
(Applause)
