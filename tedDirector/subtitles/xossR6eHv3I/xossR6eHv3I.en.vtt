00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm here to spread the word about the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
magnificence of spiders

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and how much we can learn from them.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Spiders are truly global citizens.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
You can find spiders in nearly

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
every terrestrial habitat.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
This red dot marks

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
the Great Basin of North America,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
project there with some collaborators.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Here's one of our field sites,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and just to give you a sense of perspective,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
this little blue smudge here,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
that's one of my collaborators.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
This is a rugged and barren landscape,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
yet there are quite a few spiders here.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
grappling with a beetle.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Spiders are not just everywhere,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
but they're extremely diverse.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
There are over 40,000 described species

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.260
of spiders.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
To put that number into perspective,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
here's a graph comparing the 40,000

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
species of spiders

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to the 400 species of primates.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
There are two orders of magnitude more

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
spiders than primates.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Spiders are also extremely old.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
On the bottom here,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
this is the geologic timescale,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and the numbers on it indicate millions

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
of years from the present, so the zero here,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that would be today.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
So what this figure shows is that spiders

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
date back to almost 380 million years.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
To put that into perspective, this red

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
vertical bar here marks the divergence time

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
of humans from chimpanzees,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
a mere seven million years ago.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
All spiders make silk

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
at some point in their life.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and silk is essential to their survival

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and reproduction.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Even fossil spiders can make silk,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
as we can see from this impression of

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
a spinneret on this fossil spider.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So this means that both spiders

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and spider silk have been around

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
for 380 million years.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
It doesn't take long from working with spiders

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
to start noticing how essential silk is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to just about every aspect of their life.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the trailing safety dragline,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
wrapping eggs for reproduction,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
protective retreats

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and catching prey.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
There are many kinds of spider silk.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
For example, this garden spider can make

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
seven different kinds of silks.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
When you look at this orb web, you're actually

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
seeing many types of silk fibers.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
The frame and radii of this web

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
is made up of one type of silk,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
while the capture spiral is a composite

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
of two different silks:

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
the filament and the sticky droplet.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
How does an individual spider

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
make so many kinds of silk?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
To answer that, you have to look a lot closer

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at the spinneret region of a spider.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
those of us spider silk biologists, this is what

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
we call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter)

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
We spend long days ...

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
(Laughter)

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We spend long days and nights

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
staring at this part of the spider.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
And this is what we see.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
You can see multiple fibers

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
coming out of the spinnerets, because

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
each spinneret has many spigots on it.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
and if you were to trace the fiber back

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
into the spider, what you would find is that

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
each spigot connects to its own individual

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
an orb-web-weaving spider,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and I hope you do,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
what you would find is a bounty

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
of beautiful, translucent silk glands.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Inside each spider, there are hundreds

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
of silk glands, sometimes thousands.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
These can be grouped into seven categories.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
They differ by size, shape,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and sometimes even color.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
In an orb-web-weaving spider,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
you can find seven types of silk glands,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
and what I have depicted here in this picture,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
let's start at the one o'clock position,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
to make the outer silk of an egg sac.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
glands which combine to make the sticky

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
capture spiral of an orb web.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
silk lines to a substrate.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
There's also aciniform silk,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
which is used to wrap prey.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And the most studied silk line

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
of them all: major ampullate silk.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
This is the silk that's used to make the frame

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and radii of an orb web, and also

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
the safety trailing dragline.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
But what, exactly, is spider silk?

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Nearly all of these proteins can be explained

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
by a single gene family,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
so this means that the diversity of silk types

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.260
we see today is encoded by one gene family,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
so presumably the original spider ancestor

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
made one kind of silk,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
and over the last 380 million years,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
that one silk gene has duplicated

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
and then diverged, specialized,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
over and over and over again, to get

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
the large variety of flavors of spider silks

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that we have today.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
There are several features that all these silks

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
have in common. They all have a common

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
design, such as they're all very long --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
they're sort of outlandishly long

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
compared to other proteins.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
in the amino acids glycine and alanine.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
To give you an idea of what

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
a spider silk protein looks like,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
this is a dragline silk protein,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
it's just a portion of it,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
from the black widow spider.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
This is the kind of sequence that I love

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
looking at day and night. (Laughter)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
So what you're seeing here is the one letter

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
in the glycines with green,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and the alanines in red, and so

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
You can also see that there's a lot of short

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
sequence motifs that repeat over and over

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and over again, so for example there's a lot of

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
You can think of these short motifs

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
that repeat over and over again as words,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and these words occur in sentences.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
So for example this would be one sentence,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and you would get this sort of green region

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and the red polyalanine, that repeats

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
over and over and over again,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and you can have that hundreds and

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
hundreds and hundreds of times within

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
an individual silk molecule.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Silks made by the same spider can have

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
dramatically different repeat sequences.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
At the top of the screen, you're seeing

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
the repeat unit from the dragline silk

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
of a garden argiope spider.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
It's short. And on the bottom,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
this is the repeat sequence for the

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
egg case, or tubuliform silk protein,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
for the exact same spider. And you can see

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
how dramatically different

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
these silk proteins are -- so this is

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
sort of the beauty of the diversification

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
of the spider silk gene family.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
You can see that the repeat units differ

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
in length. They also differ in sequence.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So I've colored in the glycines again

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
in green, alanine in red, and the serines,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
the letter S, in purple. And you can see

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that the top repeat unit can be explained

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
almost entirely by green and red,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and the bottom repeat unit has

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
a substantial amount of purple.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
What silk biologists do is we try to relate

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
these sequences, these amino acid

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
sequences, to the mechanical properties

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of the silk fibers.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
completely outside their body.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
This makes testing spider silk really, really

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
easy to do in the laboratory, because

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
we're actually, you know, testing it in air

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that's exactly the environment that

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
spiders are using their silk proteins.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
So this makes quantifying silk properties by

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
methods such as tensile testing, which is

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
basically, you know, tugging on one end

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.260
of the fiber, very amenable.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Here are stress-strain curves

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
generated by tensile testing

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
five fibers made by the same spider.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So what you can see here is that

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
the five fibers have different behaviors.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
that's stress. If you look at the maximum

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
stress value for each of these fibers,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
you can see that there's a lot of variation,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
is the strongest of these fibers.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
We think that's because the dragline silk,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
which is used to make the frame and radii

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
for a web, needs to be very strong.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
On the other hand, if you were to look at

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
strain -- this is how much a fiber can be

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
extended -- if you look at the maximum value

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
here, again, there's a lot of variation

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
and the clear winner is flagelliform,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
or the capture spiral filament.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
actually stretch over twice its original length.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So silk fibers vary in their strength

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
and also their extensibility.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
In the case of the capture spiral,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
it needs to be so stretchy to absorb

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
the impact of flying prey.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
basically when an insect hit the web,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
it would just trampoline right off of it.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
So if the web was made entirely out of

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
bounce right off. But by having really, really

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
able to absorb the impact

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
of that intercepted prey.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
There's quite a bit of variation within

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
the fibers that an individual spider can make.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
We call that the tool kit of a spider.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
That's what the spider has

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
to interact with their environment.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
But how about variation among spider

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
species, so looking at one type of silk

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and looking at different species of spiders?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
This is an area that's largely unexplored

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.260
but here's a little bit of data I can show you.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
This is the comparison of the toughness

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
of the dragline spilk spun

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
by 21 species of spiders.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
It's been hypothesized that

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
should have the toughest dragline silks

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
because they must intercept flying prey.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
What you see here on this toughness graph

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
is the higher the black dot is on the graph,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
the higher the toughness.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
The 21 species are indicated here by this

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
their genetic relationships, and I've colored

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
If you look right here at the two red arrows,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
they point to the toughness values

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
for the draglines of nephila clavipes and

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
araneus diadematus.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
These are the two species of spiders

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
for which the vast majority of time and money

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
on synthetic spider silk research has been

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
to replicate their dragline silk proteins.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
is this one right here in this white region,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
a non orb-web-weaving spider.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
This is the dragline spun by scytodes,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
the spitting spider.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
to catch prey. Instead, scytodes

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
sort of lurks around and waits for prey

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.260
by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Think of hunting with silly string.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
That's how scytodes forages.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
We don't really know why scytodes

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
needs such a tough dragline,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
but it's unexpected results like this that make

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
It frees us from the constraints

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
of our imagination.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
Now I'm going to mark on

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
the toughness values for nylon fiber,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk --

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
And what you can see is that nearly

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
all the spider draglines surpass them.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It's the combination of strength, extensibility

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and toughness that makes spider silk so

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
special, and that has attracted the attention

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
of biomimeticists, so people that turn

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
to nature to try to find new solutions.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
And the strength, extensibility and toughness

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
of spider silks combined with the fact that

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
silks do not elicit an immune response,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
have attracted a lot of interest in the use

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
of spider silks in biomedical applications,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
for example, as a component of

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
artificial tendons, for serving as

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.260
guides to regrow nerves, and for

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
scaffolds for tissue growth.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
Spider silks also have a lot of potential

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
for their anti-ballistic capabilities.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Silks could be incorporated into body

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
and equipment armor that would be more

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
lightweight and flexible

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
than any armor available today.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
In addition to these biomimetic

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
applications of spider silks,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.260
personally, I find studying spider silks

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
just fascinating in and of itself.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
I love when I'm in the laboratory,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
a new spider silk sequence comes in.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
That's just the best. (Laughter)

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
It's like the spiders are sharing

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
an ancient secret with me, and that's why

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
studying spider silk.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
The next time you see a spider web,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
please, pause and look a little closer.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
You'll be seeing one of the most

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
high-performance materials known to man.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
To borrow from the writings

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
of a spider named Charlotte,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
silk is terrific.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.260
(Applause)
