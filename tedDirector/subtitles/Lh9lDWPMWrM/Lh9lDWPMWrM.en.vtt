00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.047
So, before I became a dermatologist,

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:20.599
I started in general medicine,

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.815
as most dermatologists do in Britain.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.863
At the end of that time, I went off to Australia,

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:26.759
about 20 years ago.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.880
What you learn when you go to Australia

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.606
is the Australians are very competitive.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:33.663
And they are not magnanimous in victory.

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:35.727
And that happened a lot:

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:38.159
"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.277
I could accept that.

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:42.607
But moving into work --

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:45.145
and we have each week what's called a journal club,

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.603
when you'd sit down with the other doctors

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:49.723
and you'd study a scientific paper

00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:51.564
in relation to medicine.

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:54.313
And after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.993
a dry subject -- how many people die of heart disease,

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:59.377
what the rates are.

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:01.353
And they were competitive about this:

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:04.449
"You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.345
And of course, they were right.

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:10.326
Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do --

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:14.117
less deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes --

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.177
they're generally a healthier bunch.

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:17.868
And of course they said this was because of

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.932
their fine moral standing, their exercise,

00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:24.000
because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.031
But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.

00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.559
Within Britain, there is a gradient of health --

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.495
and this is what's called standardized mortality,

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:36.583
basically your chances of dying.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.927
This is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:41.402
but it's true today.

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:44.492
Comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north --

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.759
that's the South, that's London and places --

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.111
by latitude, and 55 degrees --

00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.495
the bad news is that's here, Glasgow.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.343
I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:59.467
(Laughter)

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.773
So what accounts for this horrible space here

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:04.977
between us up here in southern Scotland

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:05.987
and the South?

00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:07.405
Now, we know about smoking,

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.107
deep-fried Mars bars, chips -- the Glasgow diet.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:11.435
All of these things.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:14.227
But this graph is after taking into account

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:16.291
all of these known risk factors.

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.060
This is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.803
all those other known risk factors.

00:02:21.803 --> 00:02:24.027
We are left with this missing space

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:27.887
of increased deaths the further north you go.

00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:30.524
Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this.

00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:32.844
And vitamin D has had a great deal of press,

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:34.846
and a lot of people get concerned about it.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:38.838
And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:41.070
My grandmother grew up in Glasgow,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.656
back in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.854
and cod liver oil was brought in.

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:50.798
And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:54.718
And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.

00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:57.742
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.

00:02:57.742 --> 00:03:02.524
But an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,

00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:05.851
the less heart disease they have, the less cancer.

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:09.693
There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.

00:03:09.693 --> 00:03:11.987
And it is, to prevent rickets and so on.

00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:14.707
But if you give people vitamin D supplements,

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:18.139
you don't change that high rate of heart disease.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.867
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:26.724
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.

00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:30.035
It's not the only reason preventing heart disease.

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:34.404
High vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:37.619
and sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.058
is good for heart disease.

00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:42.019
Anyway, I came back from Australia,

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.515
and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:48.067
(Laughter)

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:51.218
Now, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.

00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.163
But I also became interested in research,

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:56.338
and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:57.714
Now these three guys up here,

00:03:57.714 --> 00:03:59.284
Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad,

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:02.546
won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:04.689
And they were the first people to describe

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.034
this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.

00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.059
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.930
so it lowers your blood pressure.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.097
It also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.

00:04:17.097 --> 00:04:18.483
And what was remarkable about it

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:22.554
was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.724
we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.194
or nerve transmission.

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:30.489
Very complex processes with very complex chemicals

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:32.777
that fit into very complex receptors.

00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:35.138
And here's this incredibly simple molecule,

00:04:35.138 --> 00:04:38.476
a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:43.106
and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.712
for neurotransmission, for many, many things,

00:04:45.712 --> 00:04:49.114
but particularly cardiovascular health.

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:52.416
And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:55.026
that the skin produces nitric oxide.

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:57.923
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.

00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.790
It arises in the skin.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.656
Well, having found that and published that,

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:03.712
I thought, well, what's it doing?

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:05.192
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.283
It's not the heart. What do you do?

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:11.354
So I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,

00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:15.091
and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:17.704
And I was interested in these really complex systems.

00:05:17.704 --> 00:05:21.745
We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,

00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:24.225
and how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.

00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:27.592
And I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:29.712
and then I was using knockout mouse models --

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.449
mice that couldn't make the gene.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.859
We worked out a mechanism, which -- NO was helping cells survive.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:39.680
And I then moved back to Edinburgh.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.462
And in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:44.520
It's a species close to human,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.422
with several advantages over mice:

00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:49.878
They're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:51.998
and nobody pickets your office saying,

00:05:51.998 --> 00:05:54.398
"Save the lab medical student."

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:57.661
So they're really an ideal model.

00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:59.622
But what we found

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:04.239
was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.479
It seemed we couldn't turn off the production

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.559
of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:13.351
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:17.735
we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.

00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:20.999
And the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.047
was that in the skin we have huge stores

00:06:25.047 --> 00:06:28.135
not of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:31.287
and it's released -- (Poof!) -- and in a few seconds it's away,

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:34.511
but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide --

00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:38.143
nitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.

00:06:38.143 --> 00:06:39.559
And these are more stable,

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:43.719
and your skin has got really large stores of NO.

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.544
And we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:49.855
I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores

00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:51.599
and release them from the skin,

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:54.991
where the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.

00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:57.831
Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation,

00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:03.071
and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?

00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:05.599
Well, I'm an experimental dermatologist,

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:06.904
so what we did was we thought

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:10.431
we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.

00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:14.511
And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers

00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.209
and we exposed them to ultraviolet light.

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.938
So these are kind of sunlamps.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.634
Now, what we were careful to do was,

00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:24.594
vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:28.570
and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.417
So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.698
When we put people under a lamp

00:07:34.698 --> 00:07:39.774
for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,

00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:42.314
what we produced was, we produced a rise

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:44.306
in circulating nitric oxide.

00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:47.154
So we put patients with these subjects under the UV,

00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:49.570
and their NO levels do go up,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.706
and their blood pressure goes down.

00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:54.083
Not by much, as an individual level,

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.450
but enough at a population level

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.170
to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.594
And when we shone UV at them,

00:08:02.594 --> 00:08:06.256
or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:09.518
but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.

00:08:09.518 --> 00:08:13.382
So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.

00:08:13.382 --> 00:08:15.206
Now, we're still collecting data.

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:16.654
A few good things here:

00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.801
This appeared to be more marked in older people.

00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:21.414
I'm not sure exactly how much.

00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:23.187
One of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:26.139
and clearly I do not know her age.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.571
But certainly in people older than my wife,

00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:32.704
this appears to be a more marked effect.

00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:33.955
And the other thing I should mention

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:36.011
was there was no change in vitamin D.

00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:38.131
This is separate from vitamin D.

00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:39.667
So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets,

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:41.907
it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.

00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:44.939
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:47.515
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure

00:08:47.515 --> 00:08:49.067
is your body does everything it can

00:08:49.067 --> 00:08:50.650
to keep your blood pressure at the same place.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.299
If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.204
your body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,

00:08:55.204 --> 00:08:57.428
do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.

00:08:57.428 --> 00:09:00.404
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.

00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:02.211
So what we've next done

00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:05.867
is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.

00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:07.364
So we've measured -- this is again,

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:12.692
notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.

00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:15.310
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.542
by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:22.017
And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation --

00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:23.486
this is the thick line here --

00:09:23.486 --> 00:09:25.886
this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up

00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:28.710
but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.622
There is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.

00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:34.471
But the active irradiation,

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.823
during the UV and for an hour after it,

00:09:37.823 --> 00:09:39.920
there is dilation of the blood vessels.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.520
This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.896
by which you dilate the coronary arteries also,

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:46.607
to let the blood be supplied with the heart.

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:51.000
So here, further data that ultraviolet -- that's sunlight --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.879
has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:58.222
So we thought we'd just kind of model --

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:04.471
Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,

00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:08.495
so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide --

00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:10.751
the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin --

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:13.623
cleave to release NO.

00:10:13.623 --> 00:10:17.448
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.

00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:19.527
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.

00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:23.512
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,

00:10:23.512 --> 00:10:25.328
it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.

00:10:25.328 --> 00:10:27.767
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:30.280
If you live up here, in summer

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.936
the sun is coming fairly directly down,

00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:36.243
but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,

00:10:36.243 --> 00:10:39.464
and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:41.816
and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:44.144
are different from summer to winter.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.086
So what you can do is you can multiply those data

00:10:46.086 --> 00:10:48.079
by the NO that's released

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.263
and you can calculate how much nitric oxide

00:10:51.263 --> 00:10:54.432
would be released from the skin into the circulation.

00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:56.432
Now, if you're on the equator here --

00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:59.859
that's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line --

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:04.256
the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.287
it's the area in this space here.

00:11:06.287 --> 00:11:08.984
So if you're on the equator, December or June,

00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:12.240
you've got masses of NO being released from the skin.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.704
So Ventura is in southern California.

00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:16.920
In summer, you might as well be at the equator.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.976
It's great. Lots of NO is released.

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:22.919
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.

00:11:22.919 --> 00:11:26.880
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.095
but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released

00:11:31.095 --> 00:11:34.953
is next to nothing, tiny amounts.

00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:36.758
So what do we think?

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:38.350
We're still working at this story,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.262
we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:41.910
We think it's very important.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.503
We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:47.134
It's of relevance to us.

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:48.822
We think that the skin --

00:11:48.822 --> 00:11:51.710
well, we know that the skin has got very large stores

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.934
of nitric oxide as these various other forms.

00:11:53.934 --> 00:11:55.807
We suspect a lot of these come from diet,

00:11:55.807 --> 00:11:58.078
green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce

00:11:58.078 --> 00:12:01.398
has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.

00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:03.542
We think they're then stored in the skin,

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:05.942
and we think the sunlight releases this

00:12:05.942 --> 00:12:08.575
where it has generally beneficial effects.

00:12:08.575 --> 00:12:11.054
And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists --

00:12:11.054 --> 00:12:12.774
I mean, I'm a dermatologist.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.302
My day job is saying to people, "You've got skin cancer,

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:17.182
it's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."

00:12:17.182 --> 00:12:19.918
I actually think a far more important message

00:12:19.918 --> 00:12:23.342
is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:29.095
Yes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,

00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:31.966
but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:33.918
than deaths from skin cancer.

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:36.567
And I think that we need to be more aware of,

00:12:36.567 --> 00:12:38.646
and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.

00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:40.118
How much sunlight is safe,

00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:44.318
and how can we finesse this best for our general health?

00:12:44.318 --> 00:12:46.498
So, thank you very much indeed.

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:53.395
