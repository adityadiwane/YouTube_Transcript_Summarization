00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:16.085
Guatemala is recovering from
a 36-year armed conflict.

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:18.616
A conflict that was fought
during the Cold War.

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:22.669
It was really just 
a small leftist insurgency

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.836
and a devastating response by the state.

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:28.678
What we have as a result
is 200,000 civilian victims,

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.332
160,000 of those
killed in the communities:

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:36.428
small children, men, women, 
the elderly even.

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:39.858
And then we have 
about 40,000 others, the missing,

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:42.178
the ones we're still looking for today.

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:44.738
We call them the Desaparecidos.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:47.603
Now, 83 percent of the victims 
are Mayan victims,

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:50.008
victims that are the descendants

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.744
of the original inhabitants of 
Central America.

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:56.251
And only about 17 percent are of 
European descent.

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.308
But the most important thing here is that

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:04.329
the very people who are supposed to 
defend us, the police, the military,

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.995
are the ones that committed
most of the crimes.

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:11.327
Now the families,
they want information.

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:12.902
They want to know what happened.

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:15.092
They want the bodies of their loved ones.

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:18.339
But most of all,
what they want is they want you,

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:22.395
they want everyone to know
that their loved ones did nothing wrong.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:28.824
Now, my case was that my father
received death threats in 1980.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.583
And we left.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.337
We left Guatemala and we came here.

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:33.543
So I grew up in New York,

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:37.323
I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact,
and I went to New Utrecht High School

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:39.141
and I graduated from Brooklyn College.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.707
The only thing was that

00:01:40.707 --> 00:01:44.578
I really didn't know what 
was happening in Guatemala.

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:47.447
I didn't care for it; it was too painful.

00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:51.754
But it wasn't till 1995 that I decided
to do something about it.

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:52.908
So I went back.

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:56.488
I went back to Guatemala, 
to look for the bodies,

00:01:56.488 --> 00:02:00.961
to understand what happened
and to look for part of myself as well.

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.414
The way we work is that
we give people information.

00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:08.384
We talk to the family members
and we let them choose.

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:11.614
We let them decide to tell
us the stories,

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:13.466
to tell us what they saw,

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.594
to tell us about their loved ones.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:16.880
And even more important,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.878
we let them choose to
give us a piece of themselves.

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.354
A piece, an essence, of who they are.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.611
And that DNA is what we're 
going to compare

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.331
to the DNA that comes
from the skeletons.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.386
While we're doing that, though,
we're looking for the bodies.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.374
And these are skeletons by now,

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:36.280
most of these crimes 
happened 32 years ago.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.526
When we find the grave,

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:41.656
we take out the dirt and eventually clean 
the body, document it, and exhume it.

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:45.095
We literally bring the 
skeleton out of the ground.

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:49.237
Once we have those bodies, though,
we take them back to the city, to our lab,

00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:52.321
and we begin a process of trying
to understand mainly two things:

00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.614
One is how people died.

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:57.718
So here you see a gunshot
wound to the back of the head

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.367
or a machete wound, for example.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.693
The other thing we want to understand
is who they are.

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:07.152
Whether it's a baby,

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.809
or an adult.

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.949
Whether it's a woman or a man.

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.732
But when we're done
with that analysis

00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:15.458
what we'll do is we'll take a small 
fragment of the bone

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:18.272
and we'll extract DNA from it.

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:19.367
We'll take that DNA

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:24.127
and then we'll compare it with the
DNA of the families, of course.

00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:27.771
The best way to explain this to you
is by showing you two cases.

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:30.318
The first is the case 
of the military diary.

00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:34.993
Now this is a document that was smuggled
out of somewhere in 1999.

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:39.673
And what you see there
is the state following individuals,

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:43.604
people that, like you, 
wanted to change their country,

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:46.484
and they jotted everything down.

00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:50.734
And one of the things that they wrote 
down is when they executed them.

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:53.715
Inside that yellow rectangle, 
you see a code,

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.026
it's a secret code: 300.

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:57.523
And then you see a date.

00:03:57.523 --> 00:04:01.196
The 300 means "executed" and the date 
means when they were executed.

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:04.584
Now that's going to come
into play in a second.

00:04:05.064 --> 00:04:08.689
What we did is we conducted
an exhumation in 2003,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.530
where we exhumed 220 bodies
from 53 graves in a military base.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.635
Grave 9, though, matched the family
of Sergio Saul Linares.

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:21.361
Now Sergio was a professor
at the university.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.752
He graduted from Iowa State University

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:26.129
and went back to Guatemala
to change his country.

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:30.003
And he was captured on 
February 23, 1984.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:34.092
And if you can see there, he was 
executed on March 29, 1984,

00:04:34.092 --> 00:04:35.658
which was incredible.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:38.680
We had the body, we had the family's 
information and their DNA,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.026
and now we have documents
that told us exactly what happened.

00:04:42.026 --> 00:04:45.129
But most important is about
two weeks later,

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.816
we go another hit, another match

00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:52.617
from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.

00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:55.363
The DNA of that body
also matched the DNA of that family.

00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:58.732
And then we noticed
that he was also in the diary.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:03.903
But it was amazing to see that he was 
also executed on March 29, 1984.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.749
So that led us to think, hmm, 
how many bodies were in the grave?

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:09.413
Six.

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:16.090
So then we said, how many people
were executed on March 29, 1984?

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.034
That's right, six as well.

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:26.726
So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo,
Moises and Zoilo.

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:30.574
All of them executed on the same date, 
all captured at different locations

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:32.328
and at different moments.

00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:33.492
All put in that grave.

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.636
The only thing we needed now
was the DNA of those four families

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:39.881
So we went and we looked for them
and we found them.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.844
And we identified those six bodies
and gave them back to the families.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.783
The other case I want to tell you about

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:50.871
is that of a military base 
called CREOMPAZ.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:55.482
It actually means, "to believe in peace,"
but the acronym really means

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.501
Regional Command Center
for Peacekeeping Operations.

00:05:58.501 --> 00:06:03.491
And this is where the Guatemalan military
trains peacekeepers from other countries,

00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:06.332
the ones that serve with the U.N.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:09.095
and go to countries
like Haiti and the Congo.

00:06:09.095 --> 00:06:12.608
Well, we have testimony that said that
within this military base,

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:14.713
there were bodies, there were graves.

00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:18.568
So we went in there with a search warrant
and about two hours after we went in,

00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:24.192
we found the first of 84 graves, 
a total of 533 bodies.

00:06:24.192 --> 00:06:26.829
Now, if you think about that,

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:30.166
peacekeepers being trained
on top of bodies.

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.965
It's very ironic.

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:38.802
But the bodies -- face down, most of them,
hands tied behind their backs,

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:41.426
blindfolded, all types of trauma --

00:06:41.426 --> 00:06:44.505
these were people who were defenseless
who were being executed.

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:48.530
People that 533 families are looking for.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.142
So we're going to focus on Grave 15.

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:54.838
Grave 15, what we noticed,
was a grave full of women and children,

00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:57.041
63 of them.

00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:00.269
And that immediately made us think,

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:02.544
my goodness, where is there
a case like this?

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:05.237
When I got to Guatemala in 1995,

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:09.888
I heard of a case of a massacre
that happened on May 14, 1982,

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:13.021
where the army came in, killed the men,

00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:17.256
and took the women and children 
in helicopters to an unknown location.

00:07:18.026 --> 00:07:18.968
Well, guess what?

00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:23.161
The clothing from this grave matched the 
clothing from the region

00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:24.891
where these people were taken from,

00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.274
where these women and children 
were taken from.

00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:29.746
So we conducted some DNA analysis,
and guess what?

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:33.034
We identified Martina Rojas 
and Manuel Chen.

00:07:33.034 --> 00:07:36.109
Both of them disappeared in that case,
and now we could prove it.

00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:39.119
We have physical evidence that
proves that this happened

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:41.860
and that those people 
were taken to this base.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.118
Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.

00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:49.985
His mother went to the river to wash 
clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:51.689
That's when the army came

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.029
and that's when he was taken away in 
a helicopter and never seen again

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.008
until we found him in Grave 15.

00:07:57.008 --> 00:08:02.726
So now with science, with archaeology, 
with anthropology, with genetics,

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:05.960
what we're doing is, we're
giving a voice to the voiceless.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.645
But we're doing more than that.

00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:09.810
We're actually providing 
evidence for trials,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.331
like the genocide trial that happened 
last year in Guatemala

00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:18.142
where General Ríos Montt was found guilty
of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.

00:08:18.142 --> 00:08:21.786
So I came here to tell you today
that this is happening everywhere --

00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:24.511
it's happening in Mexico
right in front of us today --

00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:26.451
and we can't let it go on anymore.

00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:29.352
We have to now come together and decide

00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:31.573
that we're not going to have 
any more missing.

00:08:31.573 --> 00:08:32.765
So no more missing, guys.

00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:35.476
Okay? No more missing.

00:08:35.476 --> 00:08:36.719
Thank you.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.935
(Applause)
