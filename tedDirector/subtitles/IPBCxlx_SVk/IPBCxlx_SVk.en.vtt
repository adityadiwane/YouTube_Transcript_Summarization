00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
As a child,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
three old women

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
who took care of me while my parents worked.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The year is 1963.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
We're at the ocean.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
It's twilight.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
We're watching the rising of the stars

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
and the shifting of the tides.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
It's a stretch of beach we know so well.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
The smooth stones on the sand

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
are familiar to us.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
If you saw these women on the street

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in their faded clothes,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
you might dismiss them

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
as poor and simple.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
That would be a mistake.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
These women are descendants

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
of Polynesian navigators,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
trained in the old ways

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
by their elders,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
and now they're passing it on to me.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.260
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
There's a new moon on the horizon.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
They begin to chant.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:02:02.260
[Hawaiian chant]

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
When they finish,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
they sit in a circle

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and ask me to come to join them.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
They want to teach me about my destiny.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I thought every seven-year-old went through this.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
(Laughter)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
"Baby girl,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
someday the world will be in trouble.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
People will forget their wisdom.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
It will take elders' voices

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
from the far corners of the world

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
to call the world into balance.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
You will go far away.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
It will sometimes be a lonely road.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
We will not be there.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
But you will look into the eyes

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
of seeming strangers,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and you will recognize your ohana,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
your family.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And it will take all of you.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
It will take all of you."

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
These words, I hold onto

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
all my life.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Because the idea of doing it alone

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
terrifies me.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
The year is 2007.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Satawal is one half-mile long

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
by one mile wide.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
It's the home of my mentor.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
His name is Pius Mau Piailug.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Mau is a palu,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
a navigator priest.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
He's also considered

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
the greatest wave finder in the world.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
There are fewer than a handful

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
of palu left on this island.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
Their tradition is so extraordinary

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
that these mariners sailed

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
three million square miles across the Pacific

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
without the use of instruments.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
They could synthesize patterns in nature

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
using the rising and setting of stars,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
the sequence and direction of waves,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
the flight patterns of certain birds.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Even the slightest hint of color

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
on the underbelly of a cloud

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
would inform them

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
and watch him go into the hull,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
it appeared that an old man

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
was going to rest.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
In fact, the hull of the canoe

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
is the womb of the vessel.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
It is the most accurate place

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
to feel the rhythm and sequence

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and direction of waves.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Mau was, in fact,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
gathering explicit data

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
using his entire body.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It's what he had been trained to do

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
since he was five years old.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Now science may dismiss this methodology,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.260
but Polynesian navigators use it today

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
because it provides them

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
an accurate determination

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
of the angle and direction

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
of their vessel.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
The palu also had

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
an uncanny ability

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
to forecast weather conditions

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
days in advance.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and he would look out,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and then he would say,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
"Okay, we go."

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
He saw that first glint of light --

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
are extraordinary,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and they are so relevant

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
for these times that we are in

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.260
when we are riding out storms.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
We are in such a critical moment

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
of our collective history.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
They have been compared

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to astronauts --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
these elder navigators

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
who sail vast open oceans

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
in double-hulled canoes

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
thousands of miles

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
from a small island.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
Their canoes, our rockets;

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
their sea, our space.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
The wisdom of these elders

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
is not a mere collection

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
of stories about old people

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
in some remote spot.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
This is part of our collective narrative.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
It's humanity's DNA.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
We cannot afford to lose it.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
The year is 2010.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Just as the women in Hawaii

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
that raised me predicted,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
the world is in trouble.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
We live in a society

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
bloated with data,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
yet starved for wisdom.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
We're connected 24/7,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
yet anxiety,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
fear, depression and loneliness

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is at an all-time high.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We must course-correct.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
An African shaman said,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
"Your society worships the jester

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
while the king stands

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
in plain clothes."

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
The link between the past and the future

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
is fragile.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
This I know intimately,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
because even as I travel

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
throughout the world

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.260
to listen to these stories and record them,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I struggle.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
I am haunted

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.260
by the fact that I no longer remember

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.260
the names of the winds and the rains.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
Mau passed away

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
five months ago,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
but his legacy and lessons live on.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And I am reminded

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
that throughout the world

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
there are cultures

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.260
with vast sums of knowledge in them,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
as potent as the Micronesian navigators,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
that are going dismissed,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
that this is a testament

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
to brilliant, brilliant

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
technology and science and wisdom

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
that is vanishing rapidly.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
Because when an elder dies a library is burned,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.260
and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
I am grateful for the fact

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
that I had a mentor like Mau

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
who taught me how to navigate.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
And I realize

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
through a lesson that he shared

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
that we continue to find our way.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
And this is what he said:

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
"The island is the canoe;

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
the canoe, the island."

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And what he meant was,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
if you are voyaging

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and far from home,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
your very survival depends

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
on everyone aboard.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
You cannot make the voyage alone,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
you were never meant to.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
This whole notion of every man for himself

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
is completely unsustainable.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
It always was.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So in closing I would offer you this:

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.260
The planet is our canoe,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and we are the voyagers.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
True navigation

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
begins in the human heart.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
It's the most important map of all.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Together, may we journey well.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
(Applause)
