00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.057
I grew up

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:19.860
diagnosed as phobically shy,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.514
and, like at least 20 other people

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:24.938
in a room of this size,

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:26.558
I was a stutterer.

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:29.218
Do you dare raise your hand?

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:33.274
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:38.126
because when we are treated that way,

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:41.190
we feel invisible sometimes,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.823
or talked around and at.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:46.648
And as I started to look at people,

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:49.394
which is mostly all I did,

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:51.632
I noticed that some people

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:56.986
really wanted attention and recognition.

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:59.170
Remember, I was young then.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.207
So what did they do?

00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:02.847
What we still do perhaps too often.

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:05.580
We talk about ourselves.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.957
And yet there are other people I observed

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:11.546
who had what I called a mutuality mindset.

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:15.142
In each situation, they found a way to talk about us

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.532
and create that "us" idea.

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.627
So my idea to reimagine the world

00:01:19.627 --> 00:01:22.493
is to see it one where we all become

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:27.078
greater opportunity-makers with and for others.

00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:29.658
There's no greater opportunity

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:32.974
or call for action for us now

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.340
than to become opportunity-makers

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.990
who use best talents together more often

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.212
for the greater good

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:42.291
and accomplish things we
couldn't have done on our own.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.765
And I want to talk to you about that,

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.165
because even more than giving,

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:50.930
even more than giving,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.902
is the capacity for us to do something smarter

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:58.406
together for the greater good

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:00.277
that lifts us both up

00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:02.147
and that can scale.

00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:03.925
That's why I'm sitting here.

00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:07.717
But I also want to point something else out:

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:10.226
Each one of you

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:14.740
is better than anybody else at something.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.724
That disproves that popular notion

00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:20.660
that if you're the smartest person in the room,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.684
you're in the wrong room.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.901
(Laughter)

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.111
So let me tell you about

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.749
a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.110
and I met this up-and-coming actress,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.800
and we were soon talking about something

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.641
that we both felt passionately about: public art.

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:39.032
And she had the fervent belief

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:42.618
that every new building in Los Angeles

00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:43.950
should have public art in it.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.698
She wanted a regulation for it,

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.253
and she fervently started —

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:49.155
who is here from Chicago? —

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:51.479
she fervently started talking about

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.464
these bean-shaped reflective sculptures

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:56.127
in Millennium Park,

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.360
and people would walk up to it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.651
and they'd smile in the reflection of it,

00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:02.260
and they'd pose and they'd vamp

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.702
and they'd take selfies together,

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:08.080
and they'd laugh.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.764
And as she was talking, a 
thought came to my mind.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.783
I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:16.298
He's getting out of San Quentin 
in a couple of weeks" —

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:18.278
(Laughter) —

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:20.740
"and he shares your fervent desire

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.936
that art should engage and
enable people to connect."

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:28.070
He spent five years in solitary,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.080
and I met him because I gave
a speech at San Quentin,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.610
and he's articulate

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.898
and he's rather easy on 
the eyes because he's buff.

00:03:36.898 --> 00:03:39.482
He had workout regime he did every day.

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:41.519
(Laughter)

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.396
I think she was following me at that point.

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.939
I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.784
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect

00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:52.260
and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.463
and place-making is when you have

00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:57.057
those mini-plazas and those urban walkways

00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:59.257
and where they're dotted with art,

00:03:59.257 --> 00:04:03.150
where people draw and 
come up and talk sometimes.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.545
I think they'd make good allies.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.696
And indeed they were.

00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:10.866
They met together. They prepared.

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:14.510
They spoke in front of the 
Los Angeles City Council.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.225
And the council members not
only passed the regulation,

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:21.308
half of them came down and asked
to pose with them afterwards.

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:26.764
They were startling, 
compelling and credible.

00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:30.206
You can't buy that.

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:32.276
What I'm asking you to consider

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:34.973
is what kind of opportunity-
makers we might become,

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:37.820
because more than wealth

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.869
or fancy titles

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:45.909
or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.249
around each other's 
better side and bring it out.

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.551
And I'm not saying this is easy,

00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.106
and I'm sure many of you have
made the wrong moves too

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.980
about who you wanted to connect with,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.574
but what I want to suggest is,

00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:01.920
this is an opportunity.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.144
I started thinking about it

00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:06.686
way back when I was a 
Wall Street Journal reporter

00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:09.104
and I was in Europe and I was
supposed to cover trends

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:11.647
and trends that transcended business

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:13.941
or politics or lifestyle.

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.315
So I had to have contacts

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.283
in different worlds very different than mine,

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:20.657
because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.

00:05:20.657 --> 00:05:23.627
And third, I had to write the story

00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:25.664
in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:29.754
so they could see how these 
trends could affect their lives.

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:33.274
That's what opportunity-makers do.

00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:36.703
And here's a strange thing:

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.919
Unlike an increasing number of Americans

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.365
who are working and living 
and playing with people

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.634
who think exactly like them

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:48.306
because we then become more rigid and extreme,

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:52.006
opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations

00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:54.263
with people unlike them,

00:05:54.263 --> 00:05:56.106
and they're building relationships,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.334
and because they do that,

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:00.212
they have trusted relationships

00:06:00.212 --> 00:06:02.363
where they can bring the right team in

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:06.180
and recruit them to solve a 
problem better and faster

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.755
and seize more opportunities.

00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:15.374
They're not affronted by differences,

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.607
they're fascinated by them,

00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:20.513
and that is a huge shift in mindset,

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.415
and once you feel it, you 
want it to happen a lot more.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:28.469
This world is calling out for us 
to have a collective mindset,

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.851
and I believe in doing that.

00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:33.156
It's especially important now.

00:06:33.156 --> 00:06:35.968
Why is it important now?

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:40.515
Because things can be devised like drones

00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:44.529
and drugs and data collection,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.644
and they can be devised by more people

00:06:46.644 --> 00:06:50.637
and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes

00:06:50.637 --> 00:06:52.977
and then, as we know from the news every day,

00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:55.124
they can be used for dangerous ones.

00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:58.468
It calls on us, each of us,

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:01.204
to a higher calling.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.960
But here's the icing on the cake:

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.216
It's not just the first opportunity

00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:08.367
that you do with somebody else

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:10.123
that's probably your greatest,

00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:12.767
as an institution or an individual.

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:14.959
It's after you've had that experience

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.904
and you trust each other.

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.715
It's the unexpected things

00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:20.539
that you devise later on

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.733
you never could have predicted.

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:28.343
For example, Marty is the husband 
of that actress I mentioned,

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:30.673
and he watched them 
when they were practicing,

00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:32.192
and he was soon talking to Wally,

00:07:32.192 --> 00:07:33.586
my friend the ex-con,

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.048
about that exercise regime.

00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:37.356
And he thought,

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.536
I have a set of racquetball courts.

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:40.860
That guy could teach it.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.313
A lot of people who work there
are members at my courts.

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:45.982
They're frequent travelers.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:47.834
They could practice in their hotel room,

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.950
no equipment provided.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.547
That's how Wally got hired.

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:53.936
Not only that, years later

00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:56.165
he was also teaching racquetball.

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:57.576
Years after that,

00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:00.657
he was teaching the racquetball teachers.

00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:05.612
What I'm suggesting is, when 
you connect with people

00:08:05.612 --> 00:08:09.719
around a shared interest and action,

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.059
you're accustomed to serendipitous

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:14.433
things happening into the future,

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:16.717
and I think that's what we're looking at.

00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:19.361
We open ourselves up to those opportunities,

00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:23.208
and in this room 
are key players in technology,

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:26.296
key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,

00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:30.079
to scale systems and projects together.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.572
So here's what I'm calling for you to do.

00:08:32.572 --> 00:08:35.928
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:40.817
Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength

00:08:40.817 --> 00:08:44.541
and they become pattern seekers.

00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:48.883
They get involved in different 
worlds than their worlds

00:08:48.883 --> 00:08:51.485
so they're trusted and they 
can see those patterns,

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.394
and they communicate to connect

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:56.540
around sweet spots of shared interest.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.356
So what I'm asking you is,

00:08:59.356 --> 00:09:01.178
the world is hungry.

00:09:01.178 --> 00:09:03.945
I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:06.656
the world is hungry for us

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:09.312
to unite together as opportunity-makers

00:09:09.312 --> 00:09:11.316
and to emulate those behaviors

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:12.922
as so many of you already do —

00:09:12.922 --> 00:09:15.948
I know that firsthand —

00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:17.770
and to reimagine a world

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.964
where we use our best talents together

00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:23.278
more often to accomplish greater things together

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:26.994
than we could on our own.

00:09:26.994 --> 00:09:29.304
Just remember,

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:32.000
as Dave Liniger once said,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.429
"You can't succeed

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:37.568
coming to the potluck with only a fork."

00:09:37.568 --> 00:09:39.525
(Laughter)

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.096
Thank you very much.

00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:45.231
Thank you. (Applause)
