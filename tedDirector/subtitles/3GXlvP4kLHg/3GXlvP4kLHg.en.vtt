00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and then nod to the person on your left.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
(Laughter)

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Now, chances are that over the last winter,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
you just nodded at would have died.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.160
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160
of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And most of those losses are because of things we know.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And below, you can see all these out yards,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
and then they're shipped out to the almonds.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
after I was here, described this not as beehives

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.160
but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
to say that we have been trying to figure out

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
what the cause of this is.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
this flu was caused by a new virus to us,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160
and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160
of course, there's the implication.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.160
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
and the question that keeps us up at night,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.160
and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
And we don't have the answer to that yet,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
very strange things that we can't begin to understand.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
beekeepers can replace them very quickly.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.160
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
the National Guard would be out.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.160
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
they can split that colony in two.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
and you can introduce that queen.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And in fact, America was the first country

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.160
it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.160
in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
you know, your three-pound packages of bees.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.160
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.160
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.160
and so they've been able to cover those losses.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.160
the same number of colonies have existed in the country,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
at about 2.4 million colonies.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
backyard pig farmer.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
(Laughter)

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And you get all of these people in the same room,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
and they're all engaged and they're getting along,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and they're all there because of the passion for bees.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Now, there's another part of that community

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
which are the commercial beekeepers,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160
intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160
I mean, there may be 100 explanations

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160
he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.160
from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.160
right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
He's the one who first identified this condition

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
and raised the alarm bells.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
And he has a history of these trucks,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.160
so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.160
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.160
is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
And you can do that one year in a row,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
you may be able to do it two years in a row.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.160
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.160
you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160
about losing this segment of our industry.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And that's important for many fronts,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.160
and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160
You know, they pick up their hives;

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.160
they move their families once or twice in a year.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160
into the almond groves.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160
They all have their breakfast

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.160
and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.160
because that's quite essential American experience.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.160
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.160
father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
And they're not people who like to ask for help,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
although they are the most helpful people ever.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.160
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
to help him replace those lost colonies.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.160
historic and exciting community to be involved with.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160
that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.160
I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and had we taken out all those ingredients,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160
-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
if we had taken out all those ingredients

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
we wouldn't have much on our plate.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.160
but clearly our diet would be diminished.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160
It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.160
And that's a really great expression, because really,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
they get paid for their services.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
They get paid by pollen and nectar,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160
to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.160
the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
of one variety, and then you have another apple tree

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
that's a different type of pollen.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
And bees are very faithful.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.160
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
However, honeybees are a minority.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.160
with the colonialists.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
And there are actually more species of bees

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
than there are mammals and birds combined.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.160
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
and very intensely in the last three years.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
We have bumblebees on the top.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
because only the queen is, over winter.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.160
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:05.160
which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160
Audience: Bee?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
(Laughter)

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.160
What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.160
they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160
and they lay an egg on it.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160
Well, these bees hang out at that hole,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.160
and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.160
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
you know that your environment is healthy,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160
are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.160
to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160
some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
but we don't understand these native pollinators

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
or all those other parts of our community.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and bats are in trouble too.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.160
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.160
because there's no money to research the bat problems.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.160
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.160
becoming the population of half of this county in three years.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.160
of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160
Nature Deficit Disorder.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160
we forgot our connection with nature.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And I think if we reconnect to nature,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
we'll be able to have the resources and that interest

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.160
to solve these problems.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
And I think we have lost our connection,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.160
and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.160
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.160
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:59.160
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.160
And so we need to rethink this idea.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
In fact, you know, the White House

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
used to have sheep in front in order to help fund

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160
it wouldn't be a bad idea.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.160
or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.160
and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
this companion you can have as it matures

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160
and as it has these different fragrances.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.160
And this is a companion,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
and this is a relationship that never dries up.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
And I encourage you to look at that.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
Now, not all of us have meadows,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
grow a meadow in a pot.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.160
but a pot in a meadow.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
But you can also have this great community of city

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
And everyone should open a beehive,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
I think this is a great way of doing it.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160
Get a beehive and grow a meadow,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
and watch that life come back into your life.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.160
And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160
we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.160
includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.160
or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
And I hope that you experience it

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.160
and I hope you tell me about it one day.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
So thank you very much for being here. 
Thank you very much.
