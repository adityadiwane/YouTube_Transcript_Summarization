00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.720
So infectious diseases, right?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.870
Infectious diseases 
are still the main cause

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.197
of human suffering and death 
around the world.

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:23.367
Every year, millions of people die
of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.713
around the world 
and even in the United States.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.319
Every year, thousands of Americans
die of seasonal flu.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.474
Now of course, humans,
we are creative. Right?

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.799
We have come up with ways to protect
ourselves against these diseases.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.104
We have drugs and vaccines.

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:39.489
And we're conscious --
we learn from our experiences

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.416
and come up with creative solutions.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.481
We used to think we're alone in this,
but now we know we're not.

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.300
We're not the only medical doctors.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.706
Now we know that there's a lot of animals
out there that can do it too.

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:51.330
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.831
Not so much different from us,

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.696
they can use plants
to treat their intestinal parasites.

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:59.143
But the last few decades have shown us
that other animals can do it too:

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:02.522
elephants, porcupines,
sheep, goats, you name it.

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:06.161
And even more interesting than that
is that recent discoveries are telling us

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:11.603
that insects and other little animals with
smaller brains can use medication too.

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.132
The problem with infectious diseases,
as we all know,

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:16.081
is that pathogens continue to evolve,

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.317
and a lot of the drugs
that we have developed

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:19.976
are losing their efficacy.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:24.209
And therefore, there is this great need
to find new ways to discover drugs

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.113
that we can use against our diseases.

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.667
Now, I think that we
should look at these animals,

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.801
and we can learn from them
how to treat our own diseases.

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:36.631
As a biologist, I have been studying
monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.999
Now, monarchs are extremely famous
for their spectacular migrations

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.109
from the U.S. and Canada
down to Mexico every year,

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.129
where millions of them come together,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.660
but it's not why I started studying them.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.051
I study monarchs because they get sick.

00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:52.513
They get sick like you.
They get sick like me.

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:55.200
And I think what they do
can tell us a lot about drugs

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.412
that we can develop for humans.

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.847
Now, the parasites
that monarchs get infected with

00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:03.726
are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha --
a mouthful.

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:05.492
What they do is they produce spores,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.884
millions of spores
on the outside of the butterfly

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:11.261
that are shown as little specks
in between the scales of the butterfly.

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.619
And this is really detrimental
to the monarch.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.267
It shortens their lifespan,

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.372
it reduces their ability to fly,

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:19.879
it can even kill them
before they're even adults.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.760
Very detrimental parasite.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.916
As part of my job, I spend a lot of time
in the greenhouse growing plants,

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:29.469
and the reason for this is that monarchs
are extremely picky eaters.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.464
They only eat milkweed as larvae.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:34.549
Luckily, there are several
species of milkweed that they can use,

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.905
and all these milkweeds
have cardenolides in them.

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.699
These are chemicals that are toxic.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.094
They're toxic to most animals,
but not to monarchs.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.316
In fact, monarchs
can take up the chemicals,

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.724
put it in their own bodies,
and it makes them toxic

00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:48.003
against their predators, such as birds.

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.377
And what they do, then,
is advertise this toxicity

00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:52.398
through their beautiful
warning colorations

00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:54.476
with this orange, black and white.

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:58.348
So what I did during my job
is grow plants in the greenhouse,

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:00.094
different ones, different milkweeds.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:02.848
Some were toxic, including
the tropical milkweed,

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:06.137
with very high concentrations
of these cardenolides.

00:03:06.137 --> 00:03:07.315
And some were not toxic.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.635
And then I fed them to monarchs.

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:12.258
Some of the monarchs were healthy.
They had no disease.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.033
But some of the monarchs were sick,

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.056
and what I found is that
some of these milkweeds are medicinal,

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:20.293
meaning they reduce the disease symptoms
in the monarch butterflies,

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:23.410
meaning these monarchs can live longer
when they are infected

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.324
when feeding on these medicinal plants.

00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:28.035
And when I found this, I had this idea,

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.343
and a lot of people said
it was a crazy idea,

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.817
but I thought, 
what if monarchs can use this?

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.876
What if they can use these plants
as their own form of medicine?

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:38.478
What if they can act as medical doctors?

00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:40.854
So my team and I
started doing experiments.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:42.655
In the first types of experiments,

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.825
we had caterpillars,
and gave them a choice:

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.566
medicinal milkweed versus
non-medicinal milkweed.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:51.186
And then we measured how much they ate
of each species over their lifetime.

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:54.200
And the result, as so often 
in science, was boring:

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.451
Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.
Fifty percent was not.

00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.721
These caterpillars didn't do
anything for their own welfare.

00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:04.686
So then we moved on to adult butterflies,

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:06.577
and we started asking the question

00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:09.735
whether it's the mothers
that can medicate their offspring.

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:12.509
Can the mothers lay their eggs
on medicinal milkweed

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.708
that will make their
future offspring less sick?

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.236
We have done these experiments now
over several years,

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:20.024
and always get the same results.

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:22.186
What we do is we put
a monarch in a big cage,

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:25.669
a medicinal plant on one side,
a non-medicinal plant on the other side,

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.245
and then we measure the number of eggs
that the monarchs lay on each plant.

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:33.354
And what we find when we do that
is always the same.

00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:36.947
What we find is that the monarchs
strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:39.048
In other words,
what these females are doing

00:04:39.048 --> 00:04:42.392
is they're laying 68 percent
of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:46.612
Intriguingly, what they do
is they actually transmit the parasites

00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:48.077
when they're laying the eggs.

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:49.512
They cannot prevent this.

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:51.443
They can also not medicate themselves.

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:53.680
But what these experiments tell us

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.509
is that these monarchs, these mothers,
can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.148
that will make their
future offspring less sick.

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:05.581
Now, this is a really
important discovery, I think,

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:08.415
not just because it tells us
something cool about nature,

00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:12.101
but also because it may tell us something
more about how we should find drugs.

00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.101
Now, these are animals that are very small

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:16.200
and we tend to think of them
as very simple.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.757
They have tiny little brains,

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:20.181
yet they can do this
very sophisticated medication.

00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:23.389
Now, we know that even today,
most of our drugs

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.148
derive from natural products,
including plants,

00:05:26.148 --> 00:05:27.760
and in indigenous cultures,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.595
traditional healers often look
at animals to find new drugs.

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:34.002
In this way, elephants have told us
how to treat stomach upset,

00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:37.291
and porcupines have told people
how to treat bloody diarrhea.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.946
What I think is important, 
though, is to move beyond

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:43.754
these large-brained mammals
and give these guys more credit,

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:46.656
these simple animals, these insects
that we tend to think of

00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:49.905
as very, very simple
with tiny little brains.

00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:53.876
The discovery that these animals
can also use medication

00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:56.355
opens up completely new avenues,

00:05:56.355 --> 00:06:01.069
and I think that maybe one day,
we will be treating human diseases

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.178
with drugs that were first
discovered by butterflies,

00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:08.153
and I think that is an amazing opportunity
worth pursuing.

00:06:08.153 --> 00:06:10.316
Thank you so much.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:14.821
(Applause)
