00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:15.072
For more than 100 years,

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.122
the telephone companies have provided
wiretapping assistance to governments.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:22.684
For much of this time,
this assistance was manual.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:26.826
Surveillance took place manually
and wires were connected by hand.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.600
Calls were recorded to tape.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.478
But as in so many other industries,

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:33.268
computing has changed everything.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.748
The telephone companies
built surveillance features

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:38.817
into the very core of their networks.

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:41.474
I want that to sink in for a second:

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:45.758
Our telephones and the networks
that carry our calls

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:48.155
were wired for surveillance first.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.582
First and foremost.

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:54.589
So what that means is that
when you're talking to your spouse,

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:58.935
your children, a colleague
or your doctor on the telephone,

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.445
someone could be listening.

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.466
Now, that someone might
be your own government;

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.653
it could also be another government,
a foreign intelligence service,

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:10.504
or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:14.098
or any other party that breaks into
the surveillance system,

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:18.611
that hacks into the surveillance system
of the telephone companies.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:24.356
But while the telephone companies
have built surveillance as a priority,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.196
Silicon Valley companies have not.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.042
And increasingly,
over the last couple years,

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.728
Silicon Valley companies have built
strong encryption technology

00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:34.690
into their communications products

00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:36.980
that makes surveillance
extremely difficult.

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.590
For example, many of you
might have an iPhone,

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:42.304
and if you use an iPhone
to send a text message

00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:44.505
to other people who have an iPhone,

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:47.539
those text messages
cannot easily be wiretapped.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:49.391
And in fact, according to Apple,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:52.306
they're not able to even see
the text messages themselves.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:56.528
Likewise, if you use FaceTime
to make an audio call

00:01:56.552 --> 00:01:59.163
or a video call with one of your
friends or loved ones,

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:01.316
that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.885
And it's not just Apple.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.667
WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.549
and used by hundreds of millions
of people around the world,

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.080
also has built strong
encryption technology into its product,

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:15.611
which means that people
in the Global South can easily communicate

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.445
without their governments,
often authoritarian,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.203
wiretapping their text messages.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.544
So, after 100 years of being able
to listen to any telephone call --

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.122
anytime, anywhere --

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:32.277
you might imagine that government
officials are not very happy.

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.087
And in fact, that's what's happening.

00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.330
Government officials are extremely mad.

00:02:36.354 --> 00:02:40.229
And they're not mad because
these encryption tools are now available.

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.071
What upsets them the most

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:46.262
is that the tech companies have built
encryption features into their products

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:48.159
and turned them on by default.

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:50.517
It's the default piece that matters.

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.316
In short, the tech companies
have democratized encryption.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.962
And so, government officials
like British Prime Minister David Cameron,

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:03.833
they believe that all communications --
emails, texts, voice calls --

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:06.445
all of these should be
available to governments,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.571
and encryption is making that difficult.

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:12.862
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic
to their point of view.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:15.418
We live in a dangerous time
in a dangerous world,

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.442
and there really are bad people out there.

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:20.581
There are terrorists and other
serious national security threats

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:24.582
that I suspect we all want
the FBI and the NSA to monitor.

00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:28.048
But those surveillance
features come at a cost.

00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:30.512
The reason for that is

00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:33.022
that there is no such thing
as a terrorist laptop,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.553
or a drug dealer's cell phone.

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:37.865
We all use the same
communications devices.

00:03:38.577 --> 00:03:42.252
What that means is that
if the drug dealers' telephone calls

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:44.821
or the terrorists' telephone calls
can be intercepted,

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:46.841
then so can the rest of ours, too.

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:48.492
And I think we really need to ask:

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:51.643
Should a billion people
around the world be using devices

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.086
that are wiretap friendly?

00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:59.155
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance
systems that I've described --

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.290
this is not imaginary.

00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:02.774
In 2009,

00:04:02.798 --> 00:04:06.845
the surveillance systems that Google
and Microsoft built into their networks --

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.360
the systems that they use to respond
to lawful surveillance requests

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:11.550
from the police --

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:14.242
those systems were compromised
by the Chinese government,

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:16.663
because the Chinese government
wanted to figure out

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:19.579
which of their own agents
the US government was monitoring.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.540
By the same token,

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:24.983
in 2004, the surveillance system
built into the network

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:28.181
of Vodafone Greece --
Greece's largest telephone company --

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.784
was compromised by an unknown entity,

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:32.848
and that feature,
the surveillance feature,

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.150
was used to wiretap
the Greek Prime Minister

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.893
and members of the Greek cabinet.

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:40.377
The foreign government or hackers
who did that were never caught.

00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:45.652
And really, this gets to the very problem
with these surveillance features,

00:04:45.676 --> 00:04:46.936
or backdoors.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.162
When you build a backdoor
into a communications network

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:51.487
or piece of technology,

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:54.559
you have no way of controlling
who's going to go through it.

00:04:55.243 --> 00:04:56.688
You have no way of controlling

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:59.482
whether it'll be used by your side
or the other side,

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:01.417
by good guys, or by bad guys.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.499
And so for that reason,
I think that it's better

00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:07.175
to build networks
to be as secure as possible.

00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:10.680
Yes, this means that in the future,

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:13.270
encryption is going to make
wiretapping more difficult.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.949
It means that the police
are going to have a tougher time

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.285
catching bad guys.

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.865
But the alternative would mean
to live in a world

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.520
where anyone's calls or anyone's
text messages could be surveilled

00:05:23.544 --> 00:05:27.270
by criminals, by stalkers
and by foreign intelligence agencies.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:29.606
And I don't want to live
in that kind of world.

00:05:30.102 --> 00:05:32.817
And so right now,
you probably have the tools

00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:35.159
to thwart many kinds
of government surveillance

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:38.166
already on your phones
and already in your pockets,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.969
you just might not realize how strong
and how secure those tools are,

00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:45.522
or how weak the other ways
you've used to communicate really are.

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:48.864
And so, my message to you is this:

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.763
We need to use these tools.

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:54.543
We need to secure our telephone calls.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:56.416
We need to secure our text messages.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.602
I want you to use these tools.

00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:01.982
I want you to tell your loved ones,
I want you to tell your colleagues:

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:04.430
Use these encrypted communications tools.

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:07.130
Don't just use them
because they're cheap and easy,

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:09.158
but use them because they're secure.

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:10.437
Thank you.

00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.047
(Applause)
