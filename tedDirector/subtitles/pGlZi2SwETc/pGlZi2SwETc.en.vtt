00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.120
Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.130
and you start talking, and after a while,
the question comes up,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.000
"So, what do you do for work?"

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:26.950
And since you think
your job is interesting,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.230
you say, "I'm a mathematician."
(Laughter)

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.080
And inevitably, during that conversation

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.750
one of these two phrases come up:

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.195
A) "I was terrible at math,
but it wasn't my fault.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.613
It's because the teacher
was awful." (Laughter)

00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:47.582
Or B) "But what is math really for?"

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:48.610
(Laughter)

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.955
I'll now address Case B.

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.510
(Laughter)

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.354
When someone asks you what math is for,
they're not asking you

00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:00.203
about applications
of mathematical science.

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:01.554
They're asking you,

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:05.485
why did I have to study that bullshit
I never used in my life again? (Laughter)

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:07.924
That's what they're actually asking.

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:12.124
So when mathematicians are asked
what math is for,

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:14.404
they tend to fall into two groups:

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:19.739
54.51 percent of mathematicians
will assume an attacking position,

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.559
and 44.77 percent of mathematicians
will take a defensive position.

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:29.068
There's a strange 0.8 percent,
among which I include myself.

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.155
Who are the ones that attack?

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.902
The attacking ones are mathematicians
who would tell you

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.849
this question makes no sense,

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.597
because mathematics
have a meaning all their own --

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.144
a beautiful edifice with its own logic --

00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.011
and that there's no point

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.558
in constantly searching
for all possible applications.

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:47.847
What's the use of poetry?
What's the use of love?

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:50.908
What's the use of life itself? 
What kind of question is that?

00:01:50.908 --> 00:01:52.529
(Laughter)

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.296
Hardy, for instance, was a model
of this type of attack.

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.242
And those who stand in defense tell you,

00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:03.082
"Even if you don't realize it, friend,
math is behind everything."

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:04.340
(Laughter)

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.218
Those guys,

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:10.246
they always bring up
bridges and computers.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.841
"If you don't know math,
your bridge will collapse."

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.286
(Laughter)

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:17.523
It's true, computers are all about math.

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:20.008
And now these guys
have also started saying

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:25.050
that behind information security
and credit cards are prime numbers.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.379
These are the answers your math teacher
would give you if you asked him.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.544
He's one of the defensive ones.

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.384
Okay, but who's right then?

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:35.990
Those who say that math
doesn't need to have a purpose,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.849
or those who say that math
is behind everything we do?

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.520
Actually, both are right.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.183
But remember I told you

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:45.726
I belong to that strange 0.8 percent
claiming something else?

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.929
So, go ahead, ask me what math is for.

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.858
Audience: What is math for?

00:02:51.858 --> 00:02:56.673
Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,
76.34 percent of you asked the question,

00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:59.600
23.41 percent didn't say anything,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.827
and the 0.8 percent --

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:03.675
I'm not sure what those guys are doing.

00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:07.175
Well, to my dear 76.31 percent --

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:11.815
it's true that math doesn't need
to serve a purpose,

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.685
it's true that it's
a beautiful structure, a logical one,

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.537
probably one
of the greatest collective efforts

00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:19.633
ever achieved in human history.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.732
But it's also true that there,

00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:26.331
where scientists and technicians
are looking for mathematical theories

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.641
that allow them to advance,

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:32.438
they're within the structure of math,
which permeates everything.

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:35.585
It's true that we have to go
somewhat deeper,

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.308
to see what's behind science.

00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:40.858
Science operates on intuition, creativity.

00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:44.772
Math controls intuition
and tames creativity.

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:47.937
Almost everyone
who hasn't heard this before

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:50.647
is surprised when they hear
that if you take

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:55.187
a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,
the size we normally use,

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:58.505
and, if it were big enough,
fold it 50 times,

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:04.205
its thickness would extend almost
the distance from the Earth to the sun.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.201
Your intuition tells you it's impossible.

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:09.622
Do the math and you'll see it's right.

00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:12.135
That's what math is for.

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:15.917
It's true that science, all types
of science, only makes sense

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:19.288
because it makes us better understand
this beautiful world we live in.

00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:20.669
And in doing that,

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.179
it helps us avoid the pitfalls
of this painful world we live in.

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:27.657
There are sciences that help us
in this way quite directly.

00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:29.413
Oncological science, for example.

00:04:29.413 --> 00:04:32.904
And there are others we look at from afar,
with envy sometimes,

00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:35.464
but knowing that we are
what supports them.

00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:38.213
All the basic sciences
support them,

00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:40.649
including math.

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:44.366
All that makes science, science
is the rigor of math.

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:49.242
And that rigor factors in
because its results are eternal.

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:51.757
You probably said or were told
at some point

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.708
that diamonds are forever, right?

00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:58.392
That depends on
your definition of forever!

00:04:58.392 --> 00:05:00.883
A theorem -- that really is forever.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:02.134
(Laughter)

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:05.486
The Pythagorean theorem is still true

00:05:05.486 --> 00:05:08.601
even though Pythagoras is dead,
I assure you it's true. (Laughter)

00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:09.946
Even if the world collapsed

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.391
the Pythagorean theorem
would still be true.

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.452
Wherever any two triangle sides
and a good hypotenuse get together

00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:17.673
(Laughter)

00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:20.534
the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.
It works like crazy.

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:23.355
(Applause)

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:31.407
Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves
to come up with theorems.

00:05:31.407 --> 00:05:33.143
Eternal truths.

00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:35.909
But it isn't always easy to know
the difference between

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.815
an eternal truth, or theorem,
and a mere conjecture.

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:41.829
You need proof.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.596
For example,

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:48.423
let's say I have a big,
enormous, infinite field.

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:52.132
I want to cover it with equal pieces,
without leaving any gaps.

00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:54.256
I could use squares, right?

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:58.222
I could use triangles.
Not circles, those leave little gaps.

00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:01.134
Which is the best shape to use?

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:05.687
One that covers the same surface,
but has a smaller border.

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:10.396
In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria
said the best is to use hexagons,

00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:12.243
just like bees do.

00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:13.990
But he didn't prove it.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.688
The guy said, "Hexagons, great!
Let's go with hexagons!"

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:19.656
He didn't prove it,
it remained a conjecture.

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:21.334
"Hexagons!"

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:24.964
And the world, as you know,
split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,

00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:30.253
until 1700 years later

00:06:30.253 --> 00:06:35.707
when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved

00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:40.641
that Pappus and the bees were right --
the best shape to use was the hexagon.

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:43.123
And that became a theorem,
the honeycomb theorem,

00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:45.183
that will be true forever and ever,

00:06:45.183 --> 00:06:48.224
for longer than any diamond
you may have. (Laughter)

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.033
But what happens if we go
to three dimensions?

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:54.944
If I want to fill the space
with equal pieces,

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:56.805
without leaving any gaps,

00:06:56.805 --> 00:06:58.638
I can use cubes, right?

00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:01.994
Not spheres, those leave little gaps.
(Laughter)

00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:04.957
What is the best shape to use?

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:09.017
Lord Kelvin, of the famous
Kelvin degrees and all,

00:07:09.607 --> 00:07:15.121
said that the best was to use
a truncated octahedron

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:19.507
which, as you all know --

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:21.035
(Laughter) --

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:22.814
is this thing here!

00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:25.753
(Applause)

00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:29.225
Come on.

00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:32.862
Who doesn't have a truncated
octahedron at home? (Laughter)

00:07:32.862 --> 00:07:34.089
Even a plastic one.

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:36.846
"Honey, get the truncated octahedron,
we're having guests."

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.240
Everybody has one!
(Laughter)

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.614
But Kelvin didn't prove it.

00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:44.655
It remained a conjecture --
Kelvin's conjecture.

00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:50.177
The world, as you know, then split into
Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists

00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:51.599
(Laughter)

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:55.496
until a hundred or so years later,

00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:02.072
someone found a better structure.

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:08.026
Weaire and Phelan
found this little thing over here --

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:09.665
(Laughter) --

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:13.209
this structure to which they gave
the very clever name

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:15.375
"the Weaire-€“Phelan structure."

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.911
(Laughter)

00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.568
It looks like a strange object,
but it isn't so strange,

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.239
it also exists in nature.

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:24.844
It's very interesting that this structure,

00:08:24.844 --> 00:08:27.037
because of its geometric properties,

00:08:27.037 --> 00:08:32.229
was used to build the Aquatics Center
for the Beijing Olympic Games.

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:35.714
There, Michael Phelps
won eight gold medals,

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:38.875
and became the best swimmer of all time.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:42.616
Well, until someone better
comes along, right?

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:45.015
As may happen
with the Weaire-€“Phelan structure.

00:08:45.015 --> 00:08:47.633
It's the best
until something better shows up.

00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:52.225
But be careful, because this one
really stands a chance

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:57.205
that in a hundred or so years,
or even if it's in 1700 years,

00:08:57.205 --> 00:09:02.603
that someone proves
it's the best possible shape for the job.

00:09:02.978 --> 00:09:07.348
It will then become a theorem,
a truth, forever and ever.

00:09:07.348 --> 00:09:10.302
For longer than any diamond.

00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:14.567
So, if you want to tell someone

00:09:15.777 --> 00:09:18.823
that you will love them forever

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:20.890
you can give them a diamond.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.421
But if you want to tell them
that you'll love them forever and ever,

00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.172
give them a theorem!

00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:27.263
(Laughter)

00:09:27.263 --> 00:09:29.853
But hang on a minute!

00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:32.183
You'll have to prove it,

00:09:32.183 --> 00:09:34.466
so your love doesn't remain

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.299
a conjecture.

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.543
(Applause)
