00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
How do you feed a city?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
It's one of the great questions of our time.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.160
or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.160
there is going to be food there waiting for us,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
having magically come from somewhere.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
enough food has to be produced,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
transported, bought and sold,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
cooked, eaten, disposed of,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
and that something similar has to happen every day

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
for every city on earth,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
We live in places like this as if

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
they're the most natural things in the world,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
forgetting that because we're animals

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
and that we need to eat,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
we're actually as dependent on the natural world

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
as our ancient ancestors were.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
And as more of us move into cities,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
more of that natural world is being

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
in order to feed us.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
These are extraordinary landscapes,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
but few of us ever get to see them.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
And increasingly these landscapes

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
are not just feeding us either.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
As more of us move into cities,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
more of us are eating meat,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
so that a third of the annual grain crop globally

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
now gets fed to animals

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
rather than to us human animals.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160
And given that it takes three times as much grain --

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160
actually ten times as much grain --

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.160
that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
And it's an escalating problem too.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
of us are going to be living in cities.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
meat and dairy consumed.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
by 2050.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160
to create new arable land.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
of existing arables to salinization and erosion.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
of food that we consume in the West.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
we don't actually value it.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.160
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.160
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
None of it makes very much sense.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160
is controlled by just five multinational corporations,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
it's a grim picture.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
And if we look to the future,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
it's an unsustainable diet.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160
So how did we get here?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.160
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
about 10,000 years ago, I would say,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
is the beginning of this process

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
in the ancient Near East,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160
known as the Fertile Crescent.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
And it was also fertile.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
that two extraordinary inventions,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
agriculture and urbanism, happened

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
roughly in the same place and at the same time.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
This is no accident,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Because it was discovery of grain

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
by our ancient ancestors for the first time

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
that produced a food source that was large enough

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.160
and stable enough to support permanent settlements.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
And if we look at what those settlements were like,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
we see they were compact.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160
They were surrounded by productive farm land

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
and dominated by large temple complexes

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
like this one at Ur,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
that were, in fact, effectively,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
spiritualized, central food distribution centers.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
So, if you like,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
was dominated by the grain and the harvest

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160
that sustained them.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
But of course not all of them were that small.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
by the first century A.D.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.160
So how did a city like this feed itself?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
Basically, Rome had access to the sea,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
which were rough.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And the food obviously went off very quickly.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
So Rome effectively waged war

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
on places like Carthage and Egypt

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
just to get its paws on their grain reserves.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.160
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
was really sort of one long, drawn out

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160
militarized shopping spree, really.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160
(Laughter)

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160
at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
So Rome shaped its hinterland

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
through its appetite.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
happened in the pre-industrial world.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
along the bottom of this map.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
And the roads leading up from them

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160
to Cheapside, which was the main market,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
were also grain markets.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And if you look at the name of one of those streets,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
Bread Street, you can tell

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
what was going on there 300 years ago.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
And the same of course was true for fish.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160
operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Everybody else was wandering around

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
with mobile phones that looked like bricks

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.160
This is another thing about food in cities:

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160
Once its roots into the city are established,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.160
they very rarely move.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Meat is a very different story

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
because, of course, animals could walk into the city.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
So much of London's meat

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
was coming from the northwest,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160
from Scotland and Wales.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
which is why Smithfield,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
London's very famous meat market, was located up there.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
and so the birds were coming in

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.160
with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
And then when they hit the eastern end

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
which is why it's called Poultry.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.160
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
built before the industrial age,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.160
you can trace food coming in to it.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
Friday Street, in a previous life,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
But also you have to imagine it full of food.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
Because the streets and the public spaces

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
were the only places where food was bought and sold.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
and be unaware of where your food came from.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
about three days earlier.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
So this was obviously an organic city,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
part of an organic cycle.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
And then 10 years later everything changed.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
were pigs and sheep.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.160
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
somewhere in the countryside.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160
And they're coming into the city by rail.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
And this changes everything.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
To start off with, it makes it possible

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
for the first time to grow cities,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
really any size and shape, in any place.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Cities used to be constrained by geography;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160
they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
And as you can see from these maps of London,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
in the 90 years after the trains came,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160
it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
by animals coming in on foot, and so on,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
to a large splurge,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.160
either animals or people.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.160
and really this marks the end of this process.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
It's the final emancipation of the city

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
from any apparent relationship with nature at all.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.160
devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.160
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
came back with a week's worth of shopping,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160
and wondered what on earth to do with it.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.160
And this really is the moment when our relationship,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
both with food and cities, changes completely.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.160
Here we have food -- that used to be the center,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160
the social core of the city -- at the periphery.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
Now it's anonymous.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
We used to cook; now we just add water,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
We just read the back of a label on a packet.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.160
One of the great ironies of modern food systems

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.160
is that they've made the very thing they promised

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.160
to make easier much harder.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.160
they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
which is that of us and nature.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.160
So what are we going to do about that?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160
It's not a new question.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.160
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
if that sounds remotely familiar,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160
and grew vegetables in their back gardens,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
and ate communal meals together, and so on.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
And I think you could argue that

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
even though More never framed it that way.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.160
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
joined to one another by railway.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160
And again, food could be said to be

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.160
the ordering principle of his vision.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160
It even got built, but nothing to do with

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
this vision that Howard had.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
that they are Utopian.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
It can either mean a good place, or no place.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.160
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
And I think, as a conceptual tool

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
that makes it not much use.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
So I've come up with an alternative,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160
"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
I believe we already live in Sitopia.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.160
We live in a world shaped by food,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.160
and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.160
Well I think it looks a bit like this.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
But anyway, this is -- (Laughter)

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
it's food at the center of life,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160
at the center of family life, being celebrated,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.160
being enjoyed, people taking time for it.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
This is where food should be in our society.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.160
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
By the way, these can be men as well.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
It's people who think about food,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
who think ahead, who plan,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160
who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160
and actually recognize them.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
We need these people. We're part of a network.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.160
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
It's common. It's fresh.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
It's part of the social life of the city.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and is not just a zero-sum commodity

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
off in some unseen hell-hole.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
Cows with a view.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
Steaming piles of humus.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
And this is a community project

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.160
I visited recently in Toronto.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.160
all about food and growing their own food.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160
plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
But anyway, these kinds of projects

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160
that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.160
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
already exists in little pockets everywhere.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
The trick is to join them up,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
to use food as a way of seeing.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
We're going to see them more like this,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160
as part of the productive, organic framework

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
of which they are inevitably a part,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
symbiotically connected.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
But of course, that's not a great image either,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.160
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160
We need to be thinking more about permaculture,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
which is why I think this image just

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
It's a re-conceptualization

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
of the way food shapes our lives.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.160
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
And I think the message of this is very clear.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
If the city looks after the country,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
the country will look after the city.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
And I want us to ask now,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
if he painted this image today?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.160
What would an allegory of good government look like today?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
Because I think it's an urgent question.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
It's one we have to ask,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
and we have to start answering.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
We know we are what we eat.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
But if we take that idea, we can use food

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.160
as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
Thank you very much.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
(Applause)
