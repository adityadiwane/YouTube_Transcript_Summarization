00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
So I work in marketing, which I love,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
but my first passion was physics,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
when I had a little less gray hair.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
So he taught me

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that physics is cool

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
that physics can teach us something about marketing.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
So quick show of hands --

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
who studied some marketing in university?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Who studied some physics in university?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Pretty good. And at school?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Okay, lots of you.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
So, physics and marketing.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
"The force equals mass times acceleration."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
should have studied a bit more carefully

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
before they ran this campaign.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
(Laughter)

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
But if we rearrange this formula quickly,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
which means

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
it requires more force to change its direction.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
It's the same with brands:

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
the more force is needed to change its positioning.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
And that's one of the reasons why

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
rather than try to persuade the world

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
that Andersen's could stand for something

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
other than accountancy.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
It explains why Hoover

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
found it very difficult to persuade the world

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that it was more than vacuum cleaners,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
keep brands separate,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
like Ariel and Pringles and Dove

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
rather than having one giant parent brand.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
the more force is needed

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
to change its direction.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
The marketing is, the bigger a brand,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
the more difficult it is to reposition it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
So think about a portfolio of brands

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
or maybe new brands for new ventures.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Getting a little more technical now.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
So this says that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
it's impossible, by definition,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and the momentum of a particle,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and you shine a light on it,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
then the photon of light has momentum,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
which knocks the particle,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
By measuring it,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
the act of measurement changes it.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
The act of observation changes it.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
It's the same in marketing.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Think about the group of moms

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
who stuff their trolleys

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
but don't shop like that any other day.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And if you think about the number of people

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
who claim in surveys

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
to regularly look for porn on the Web,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
it's very few.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
So luckily, the science --

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
more digital media consumption,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
you can measure more what consumers actually do,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
rather than what they say they do.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So the physics is

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
you can never accurately and exactly

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
measure a particle,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
because the observation changes it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
that try to measure what consumers actually do,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
rather than what they say they'll do

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
or anticipate they'll do.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So next, the scientific method --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
an axiom of physics, of all science --

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
you can only disprove it.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
What this means is you can gather more and more data

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
around a hypothesis or a positioning,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And only one contrary data point

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
can blow your theory out of the water.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So if we take an example --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that the planets would rotate around the Earth.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
to blow that idea out of the water.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
And there are parallels for marketing --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
you can invest for a long time in a brand,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
but a single contrary observation of that positioning

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
will destroy consumers' belief.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Take BP --

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
they spent millions of pounds over many years

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
but then one little accident.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
Think about Toyota.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
It was, for a long time, revered

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
as the most reliable of cars,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and then they had the big recall incident.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And Tiger Woods, for a long time,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
the perfect brand ambassador.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
Well, you know the story.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.260
(Laughter)

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
So the physics is

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
that you cannot prove a hypothesis,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
but it's easy to disprove it --

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
any hypothesis is shaky.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And the marketing is

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
one bad week can undermine decades of good work.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
that can undermine your brand.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
the second law of thermodynamics.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
This says that entropy,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
which is a measure of the disorder of a system,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
will always increase.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
The same is true of marketing.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
If we go back 20 years,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
could pretty much define a brand.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But where we are today, things have changed.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
You can get a strong brand image

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
or a message

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
and put it out there like the Conservative Party did

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
earlier this year with their election poster.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
But then you lose control of it.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.260
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
that are available now to every consumer,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
it's impossible to control where it goes.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
Your brand starts being dispersed,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
(Laughter)

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
it gets more chaotic.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
(Laughter)

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
It's out of your control.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.260
(Laughter)

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
But while this may be unsettling for marketers,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
it's actually a good thing.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
This distribution of brand energy

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
gets your brand closer to the people,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
more in with the people.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
which is ultimately good for your brand.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So, the lesson from physics is

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
You can't fight it, so embrace it

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and find a way to work with it.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
So to close,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
that physics is cool,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and hopefully, I've convinced you

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Thank you.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
(Applause)
