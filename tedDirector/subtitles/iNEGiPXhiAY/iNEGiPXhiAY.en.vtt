00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
But what we're going to talk about today

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
is really design. Really good designers are like sponges:

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
they really are curious

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
and absorb every kind of information that comes their way,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
And so that gives me an opportunity,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
because every design show that I curate

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160
kind of looks at a different world. And it's great,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
because it seems like every time I change jobs.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160
"Design and the Elastic Mind."

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
The world that I decided to focus on this particular time

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
is the world of science and the world of technology.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Technology always comes into play when design is involved,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
but science does a little less.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
and transforming them so that we can use them.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
And this is what this exhibition looks at.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
If you think about your life today,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
you go every day through many different scales,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
many different changes of rhythm and pace.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160
others are a little slower,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
Other people are not as elastic.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
And that's because there's some little bit of fear,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
these kinds of discomforts that we have,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.160
and try to make life easier for us.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
we really need, we really cherish and we really work on.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And this exhibition is about the work of designers

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160
that help us be more elastic,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.160
and also of designers that really work on this elasticity

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
as an opportunity. And one last thing is that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160
and into the preview, I would like to point out

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
this beautiful detail about scientists and design.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
You can say that the relationship between science and design

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
goes back centuries. You can of course talk about

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
and there's a gigantic history behind it.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.160
But according to a really great science historian you might know,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.160
what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
have brought to designers is this renewed interest,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
this real passion for design.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
just like designers are seeking scientists.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
that's now a multimedia company, you might know it --

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160
we founded about a year ago a monthly salon

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
you know, scientists would tell designers,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160
you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
they really started talking each others' language,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160
in London at the Serpentine.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And it's really interesting to see how this happens.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
The exhibition will talk about the work

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
of both designers and scientists,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160
I'm showing to you

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
different sections of the show right now,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160
just to give you a taste of it.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
have really opened the designer's mind.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160
not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
is the work of some scientists from UCLA.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
from the Royal College of Arts in London

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
New sensing elements on the body --

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
you can grow hairs on your nails,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
They seem very, very obsessed

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
with finding out more about the ideal mate.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.160
So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell --

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Very interesting. This is a typeface designer

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
from Israel who has designed -- he calls them "typosperma."

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept --

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160
of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi --

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160
in order to make them become -- to almost have a song

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.160
or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160
So, tissue design.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160
One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.160
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
And so, the assignment to the students was,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
how should the steak of tomorrow be?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160
what should it be like?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
So this particular student, James King,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
went around the beautiful English countryside,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
picked the best, best cow that he could see,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
and then put her in the MRI machine.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
but you know, in the future it could be made better --

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.160
which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.160
Instead, this element here is much more banal.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Something that you know can be done already

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.160
is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.160
So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.160
This is SymbioticA, and they've been working --

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.160
they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
to be wearing everything leather in the future.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
as anything in our life today,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160
and at different levels.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
One of the most interesting and most important concepts

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
is the idea of scale. We change scale very often:

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
we change resolution of screens, and

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
So you go, even in the exhibition,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160
from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
to the manipulation of really great amounts of data --

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.160
the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.160
In this particular case a section will be devoted

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160
to information design.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" --

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160
with all the go-to, go-back-to,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
also made into a beautiful choreography.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
And then also graphs by scientists,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.160
the fact that many scientists

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
So they pick the worst background

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.160
from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
It's only recently that this kind of marriage

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.160
between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" --

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.160
if we can say so -- scientific presentations.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
Another aspect of contemporary design

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
that I think is mind-opening, promising

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160
and will really be the future of design,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
is the idea of collective design.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.160
is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
So, the more the merrier.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
The more computers, the stronger the signal,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.160
and children work on the interface so that it's all based

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
on doing things together, tasks together.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
So the idea of collective design

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
is something that will become even bigger in the future,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.160
and this is chosen as an example.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.160
Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.160
between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
is the idea of existence maximum.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
That's a term that I coined a few years ago

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
while I was thinking of how pressed we are together,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
and at the same time how these small objects,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160
like the Walkman first and then the iPod,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
create bubbles of space around us that enable us

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.160
to have a metaphysical space

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
that is much bigger than our physical space.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.160
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
and have your own room in your iPod.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
And this is the work of several designers

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
by means of various techniques.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.160
This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
to have a private conversation anywhere

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
with this perfect temperature, and you can have

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
this isolation tank phone conversation

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
It's actually already used by the military a little bit,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.160
but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.160
with your senses while you're removed from it physically.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.160
And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.160
so if you're too shy to be really at the date,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160
you can stay at a distance with your flowers

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
and somebody else reenacts the date for you.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160
Rapid manufacturing is another big area

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.160
in which technology and design are, I think,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.160
bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
Rapid manufacturing is a computer file

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.160
sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.160
It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
it was machines carving out of a foam block

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
a model that was very, very fragile,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.160
and could not have any real use.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
Techniques became better -- not only carving

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.160
but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160
whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
to the point that now we can have actual chairs

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
made by rapid manufacturing.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160
but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.160
And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
customize your chair. You know, companies and designers

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
will be designing the matrix or the margins

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160
that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160
and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
not only regarding the participation of the final buyer

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
in the design process, but also no tracking,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
no warehousing, no wasted materials.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
will have to retool their own business plans

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.160
and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine --

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.160
you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much --

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160
that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.160
and print your own basketball.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.160
But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
which is very interesting.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160
It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
Mapping and tagging.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160
As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160
we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
in order to then retrace our path.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.160
Also, we do it in order to share with other people.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
Again, this communal sense of experience

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
that seems to be so important today.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
So, various ways to map and tag

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.160
are also the work of many designers nowadays.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.160
our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
And also animal senses in a way.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.160
This particular object that many people love so much

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment --

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160
and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.160
bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And so this student at the RCA

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
designed this beautiful blown-glass object

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
where the bees move from one chamber to the other

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
if they detect that particular smell

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.160
Another shape is made for cancer.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
that designers have really shaped for themselves.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
Some designers don't design objects, products,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
things that we're going to actually use,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.160
but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
They're still very useful.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
They help companies and other designers think better about the future.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
And usually they are accompanied by videos.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
We always think that robots will take care of us,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160
and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160
You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.160
for about five minutes before it does something.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
So it's really a way to make us think more

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.160
about what robots mean to us.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160
Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.160
the idea is that when you lose your loved one

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.160
or you go through a bad breakup,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.160
what you miss the most are those annoying things

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
that you used to hate when you were with the other person.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
So he designed all these series of accessories.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160
This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
There's another one that throws plates and breaks them.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
Elio Caccavale: he took the idea

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
of those dolls that explain leukemia.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.160
He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.160
and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
that explain to children where babies come from today.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160
Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160
in-vitro -- there's the whole idea

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160
of how babies can be made today that has changed.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.160
So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
One of the most beautiful things

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
is that designers really work on life,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
even though they take technology into account.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
And many designers have been working recently

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160
on the idea of death and mourning,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
and what we can do about it today with new technologies.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
Or how we should behave about it with new technologies.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
These three objects over there are hard drives

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.160
that contain the whole desktop and computer memory

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
of somebody who passed away.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
So instead of having only the pictures,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160
you will be able to put this object next to the computer

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
and all of a sudden have, you know,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
Gertrude's whole life and all of her files

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160
and her address book come alive.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.160
It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160
So to give them something tangible that shows that

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160
there is something after death, they take the gastric juices

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
of people who passed away and concentrate them,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and put them into a battery that can actually be used

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160
can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going --

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
of where the world is going.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160
Thank you very much.
