00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.276
I thought I would start
with a very brief history of cities.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.876
Settlements typically began
with people clustered around a well,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.234
and the size of that settlement
was roughly the distance you could walk

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.196
with a pot of water on your head.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.716
In fact, if you fly
over Germany, for example,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
and you look down and you see
these hundreds of little villages,

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:39.500
they're all about a mile apart.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.316
You needed easy access to the fields.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.716
And for hundreds, even thousands of years,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.316
the home was really the center of life.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.916
Life was very small for most people.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.036
It was a center of entertainment,
of energy production, of work,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.276
a center of health care.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.596
That's where babies were born
and people died.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.476
Then, with industrialization,
everything started to become centralized.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.516
You had dirty factories that were moved
to the outskirts of cities.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.876
Production was centralized
in assembly plants.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.476
You had centralized energy production.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.195
Learning took place in schools.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.180
Health care took place in hospitals.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.276
And then you had networks that developed.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.916
You had water, sewer networks

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.796
that allowed for this
kind of unchecked expansion.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.436
You had separated functions, increasingly.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.196
You had rail networks

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.036
that connected residential,
industrial, commercial areas.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.676
You had auto networks.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.956
In fact, the model was really,
give everybody a car,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.316
build roads to everything,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.796
and give people a place to park
when they get there.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.516
It was not a very functional model.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.916
And we still live in that world,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.076
and this is what we end up with.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.156
So you have the sprawl of LA,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.356
the sprawl of Mexico City.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.476
You have these unbelievable
new cities in China,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.836
which you might call tower sprawl.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.196
They're all building cities

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.156
on the model that we invented
in the '50s and '60s,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.196
which is really obsolete, I would argue,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.506
and there are hundreds
and hundreds of new cities

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.586
that are being planned all over the world.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.636
In China alone, 300 million people,
some say 400 million people,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.996
will move to the city
over the next 15 years.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.516
That means building the equivalent

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.356
of the entire built infrastructure
of the US in 15 years.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.596
Imagine that.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.276
And we should all care about this
whether you live in cities or not.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.876
Cities will account for 90 percent
of the population growth,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.676
80 percent of the global CO2,
75 percent of energy use,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.196
but at the same time
it's where people want to be,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.796
increasingly.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.636
More than half the people
now in the world live in cities,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.356
and that will just continue to escalate.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.996
Cities are places of celebration,
personal expression.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.316
You have the flash mobs
of pillow fights that --

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.436
I've been to a couple. They're quite fun.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.676
You have --

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.956
(Laughter)

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.796
Cities are where most
of the wealth is created,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.516
and particularly in the developing world,
it's where women find opportunities.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.956
That's a lot of the reason
why cities are growing very quickly.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.596
Now there's some trends
that will impact cities.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.516
First of all, work is becoming
distributed and mobile.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.156
The office building is basically obsolete
for doing private work.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.556
The home, once again,
because of distributed computation --

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.596
Communication is becoming
a center of life,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.796
so it's a center of production
and learning and shopping and health care

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.596
and all of these things
that we used to think of

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.436
as taking place outside of the home.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.436
And increasingly,
everything that people buy,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.796
every consumer product,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.756
in one way or another,
can be personalized.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.196
And that's a very important
trend to think about.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.836
So this is my image
of the city of the future.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.676
(Laughter)

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.956
In that it's a place for people, you know.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.676
Maybe not the way people dress, but --

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.129
You know, the question now is,

00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:04.596
how can we have all the good things
that we identify with cities

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.436
without all the bad things?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.676
This is Bangalore.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.756
It took me a couple of hours
to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.316
So with cities, you also have
congestion and pollution

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.996
and disease and all these negative things.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.236
How can we have the good stuff
without the bad?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.832
So we went back and started looking
at the great cities

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:23.956
that evolved before the cars.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.316
Paris was a series of these
little villages that came together,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.236
and you still see that structure today.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.213
The 20 arrondissements of Paris
are these little neighborhoods.

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:37.956
Most of what people need in life
can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.196
And if you look at the data,
when you have that kind of a structure,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.916
you get a very even distribution

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.316
of the shops and the physicians
and the pharmacies

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.236
and the cafes in Paris.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.196
And then you look at cities
that evolved after the automobile,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.956
and it's not that kind of a pattern.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.996
There's very little
that's within a five-minute walk

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.316
of most areas of places like Pittsburgh.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.596
Not to pick on Pittsburgh,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.156
but most American cities
really have evolved this way.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.356
So we said, well,
let's look at new cities,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.596
and we're involved in a couple
of new city projects in China.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.076
So we said, let's start
with that neighborhood cell.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.996
We think of it as a compact urban cell.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.596
So provide most of what most people want
within that 20-minute walk.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.156
This can also be
a resilient electrical microgrid,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.756
community heating, power,
communication networks, etc.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.556
can be concentrated there.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.436
Stewart Brand would put
a micronuclear reactor

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.436
right in the center, probably.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.916
And he might be right.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.476
And then we can form,
in effect, a mesh network.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.116
It's something of an Internet
typology pattern,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.636
so you can have a series
of these neighborhoods.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.116
You can dial up the density --

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.636
about 20,000 people per cell,
if it's Cambridge.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.196
Go up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.316
You connect everything with mass transit

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.596
and you provide most of what most people
need within that neighborhood.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.836
You can begin to develop
a whole typology of streetscapes

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.916
and the vehicles that can go on them.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.356
I won't go through all of them.
I'll just show one.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.276
This is Boulder. It's a great example
of kind of a mobility parkway,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.036
a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.584
where you can go from one end
of the city to the other

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.356
without crossing the street,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.156
and they also have bike-sharing,
which I'll get into in a minute.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.356
This is even a more interesting solution

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.596
in Seoul, Korea.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.036
They took the elevated highway,
they got rid of it,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.676
they reclaimed the street,
the river down below,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.076
below the street,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.436
and you can go from one end
of Seoul to the other

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.116
without crossing a pathway for cars.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.460
The High Line in Manhattan
is very similar.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.796
You have these rapidly emerging
bike lanes all over the world.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.476
I lived in Manhattan for 15 years.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.756
I went back a couple of weekends ago,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.356
took this photograph of these fabulous
new bike lanes that they have installed.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.196
They're still not to where Copenhagen is,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.636
where something like 42 percent
of the trips within the city

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.876
are by bicycle.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.676
It's mostly just because they have
fantastic infrastructure there.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.396
We actually did exactly
the wrong thing in Boston.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.476
The Big Dig --

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.996
(Laughter)

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.036
So we got rid of the highway
but we created a traffic island,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.756
and it's certainly not a mobility pathway
for anything other than cars.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.516
Mobility on demand is something
we've been thinking about,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.836
so we think we need an ecosystem
of these shared-use vehicles

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.956
connected to mass transit.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.036
These are some of the vehicles
that we've been working on.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.716
But shared use is really key.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.636
If you share a vehicle, you can have
at least four people use one vehicle,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.516
as opposed to one.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.460
We have Hubway here in Boston,
the Vélib' system in Paris.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.276
We've been developing,
at the Media Lab, this little city car

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.476
that is optimized
for shared use in cities.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.876
We got rid of all the useless things
like engines and transmissions.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.876
We moved everything to the wheels,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.276
so you have the drive motor,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.796
the steering motor, the breaking --
all in the wheel.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.996
That left the chassis unencumbered,
so you can do things like fold,

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.676
so you can fold this little vehicle up
to occupy a tiny little footprint.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.156
This was a video that was
on European television last week

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.796
showing the Spanish Minister of Industry
driving this little vehicle,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.636
and when it's folded, it can spin.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.916
You don't need reverse.
You don't need parallel parking.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.556
You just spin and go directly in.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.156
(Laughter)

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.956
So we've been working
with a company to commercialize this.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.076
My PhD student Ryan Chin
presented these early ideas

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.756
two years ago at a TEDx conference.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.276
So what's interesting is,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.116
then if you begin to add
new things to it, like autonomy,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.915
you get out of the car,
you park at your destination,

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:51.756
you pat it on the butt, it goes
and it parks itself, it charges itself,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.356
and you can get something
like seven times as many vehicles

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.716
in a given area as conventional cars,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.316
and we think this is the future.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.036
Actually, we could do this today.
It's not really a problem.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.596
We can combine shared use
and folding and autonomy

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.916
and we get something
like 28 times the land utilization

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.596
with that kind of strategy.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.478
One of our graduate students then says,

00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:19.636
well, how does a driverless car
communicate with pedestrians?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.836
You have nobody to make eye contact with.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.996
You don't know
if it's going to run you over.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.596
So he's developing strategies

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.196
so the vehicle can communicate
with pedestrians, so --

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.636
(Laughter)

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.596
So the headlights are eyeballs,
the pupils can dilate,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.796
we have directional audio,
we can throw sound directly at people.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.276
What I love about this project

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.916
is he solved a problem
that doesn't exist yet, so --

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.876
(Laughter)

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.756
We also think that we can
democratize access to bike lanes.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.676
You know, bike lanes are mostly used
by young guys in stretchy pants. So --

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.076
(Laughter)

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.916
We think we can develop a vehicle
that operates on bike lanes,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.916
accessible to elderly and disabled,
women in skirts, businesspeople,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.516
and address the issues
of energy congestion, mobility,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.796
aging and obesity simultaneously.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.036
That's our challenge.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.916
This is an early design
for this little three-wheel.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.436
It's an electronic bike.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.196
You have to pedal
to operate it in a bike lane,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.836
but if you're an older person,
that's a switch.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.636
If you're a healthy person, you might
have to work really hard to go fast.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.956
You can dial in 40 calories
going into work

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.636
and 500 going home,
when you can take a shower.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.916
We hope to have that built this fall.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.316
Housing is another area
where we can really improve.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.516
Mayor Menino in Boston says

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.476
lack of affordable housing
for young people

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.236
is one of the biggest
problems the city faces.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.996
Developers say, OK,
we'll build little teeny apartments.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.276
People say, we don't really want to live
in a little teeny conventional apartment.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.356
So we're saying, let's build
a standardized chassis,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.716
much like our car.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.836
Let's bring advanced technology
into the apartment,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.396
technology-enabled infill,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.396
give people the tools
within this open-loft chassis

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.236
to go through a process of defining

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.196
what their needs
and values and activities are,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.796
and then a matching algorithm
will match a unique assembly

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.796
of integrated infill components,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.916
furniture, and cabinetry,
that are personalized to that individual,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.316
and they give them the tools

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.356
to go through the process
and to refine it,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.756
and it's something like working
with an architect,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.036
where the dialogue starts

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.740
when you give an alternative
to a person to react to.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.756
Now, the most interesting
implementation of that for us

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.836
is when you can begin
to have robotic walls,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.676
so your space can convert
from exercise to a workplace,

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.436
if you run a virtual company.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.610
You have guests over,

00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:55.316
you have two guest rooms
that are developed.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.196
You have a conventional
one-bedroom arrangement

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.424
when you need it.

00:12:00.448 --> 00:12:01.976
Maybe that's most of the time.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.156
You have a dinner party.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.236
The table folds out to fit 16 people
in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.876
or maybe you want a dance studio.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.316
I mean, architects have been thinking
about these ideas for a long time.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.556
What we need to do now,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.076
develop things that can scale
to those 300 million Chinese people

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.236
that would like to live in the city,
and very comfortably.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.556
We think we can make
a very small apartment

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.916
that functions as if it's twice as big
by utilizing these strategies.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.476
I don't believe in smart homes.
That's sort of a bogus concept.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.716
I think you have to build dumb homes
and put smart stuff in it.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.996
(Laughter)

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.436
And so we've been working
on a chassis of the wall itself.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.996
You know, standardized platform

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.796
with the motors and the battery
when it operates,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.356
little solenoids that will lock it
in place and get low-voltage power.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.196
We think this can all be standardized,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.156
and then people can personalize the stuff
that goes into that wall,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.876
and like the car, we can integrate
all kinds of sensing

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.276
to be aware of human activity,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.596
so if there's a baby
or a puppy in the way,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.836
you won't have a problem.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.876
(Laughter)

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.636
So the developers say,
well, this is great.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.716
OK, so if we have a conventional building,
we have a fixed envelope,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.796
maybe we can put in 14 units.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.916
If they function
as if they're twice as big,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.476
we can get 28 units in.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.525
That means twice as much parking, though.

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:27.856
Parking's really expensive.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.516
It's about 70,000 dollars per space

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.316
to build a conventional parking spot
inside a building.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.916
So if you can have folding and autonomy,

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.356
you can do that
in one-seventh of the space.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.556
That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.156
just for the cost of the parking.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.116
You add shared use,
and you can even go further.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.196
We can also integrate
all kinds of advanced technology

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.436
through this process.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.596
There's a path to market
for innovative companies

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.276
to bring technology into the home.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.876
In this case, a project
we're doing with Siemens.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.476
We have sensors on all
the furniture, all the infill,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.196
that understands where people are
and what they're doing.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.916
Blue light is very efficient,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.076
so we have these tunable
24-bit LED lighting fixtures.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.236
It recognizes where the person is,
what they're doing,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.476
fills out the light when necessary
to full spectrum white light,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:25.716
and saves maybe 30, 40 percent
in energy consumption, we think,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:31.196
over even conventional
state-of-the-art lighting systems.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.636
This just shows you the data
that comes from the sensors

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.356
that are embedded in the furniture.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.196
We don't really believe in cameras
to do things in homes.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.196
We think these little wireless sensors
are more effective.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.476
We think we can also personalize sunlight.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.167
That's sort of the ultimate
personalization in some ways.

00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:51.156
So we've looked at articulating
mirrors of the facade

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.076
that can throw shafts of sunlight
anywhere into the space,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.476
therefore allowing you
to shade most of the glass

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.716
on a hot day like today.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.596
In this case, she picks up her phone,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.196
she can map food preparation
at the kitchen island

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.636
to a particular location of sunlight.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.836
An algorithm will keep it in that location
as long as she's engaged in that activity.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.777
This can be combined
with LED lighting as well.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.116
We think workplaces should be shared.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.950
I mean, this is really
the workplace of the future, I think.

00:15:22.974 --> 00:15:24.470
This is Starbucks, you know.

00:15:24.494 --> 00:15:25.676
Maybe a third --

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.956
And you see everybody
has their back to the wall

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.980
and they have food and coffee down the way

00:15:30.004 --> 00:15:32.436
and they're in their own
little personal bubble.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.156
We need shared spaces
for interaction and collaboration.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.396
We're not doing a very good job with that.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.476
At the Cambridge Innovation Center,
you can have shared desks.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.196
I've spent a lot of time in Finland
at the design factory of Aalto University,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.916
where the they have a shared shop
and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.076
electronics spaces, recreation places.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.556
We think ultimately,
all of this stuff can come together,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.276
a new model for mobility,
a new model for housing,

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.596
a new model for how we live and work,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.436
a path to market
for advanced technologies.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.365
But in the end, the main thing
we need to focus on are people.

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:11.956
Cities are all about people.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.996
They're places for people.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.476
There's no reason
why we can't dramatically improve

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.796
the livability and creativity of cities

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.716
like they've done in Melbourne
with the laneways

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.316
while at the same time
dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.676
It's a global imperative.
We have to get this right.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.916
Thank you.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.460
(Applause)
