00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.917
So here's the most important economic fact of our time.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.947
We are living in an age of surging income inequality,

00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:24.872
particularly between those at the very top

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:26.708
and everyone else.

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.730
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.928
but it's a global phenomenon.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:35.251
It's happening in communist China,

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.974
in formerly communist Russia,

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:40.268
it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:43.235
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.860
like Sweden, Finland and Germany.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.771
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.

00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:53.480
In the 1970s, the One Percent

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.757
accounted for about 10 percent of the national income

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.521
in the United States.

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.830
Today, their share has more than doubled

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.269
to above 20 percent.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.369
But what's even more striking

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.055
is what's happening at the very tippy top

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.297
of the income distribution.

00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:15.301
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.

00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.530
today account for more than eight percent

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.420
of the national income.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.913
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:27.681
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.199
and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:32.658
by Robert Reich,

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.397
the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:40.701
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.421
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:46.370
and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.123
of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:53.965
120 million people.

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.329
Now, as it happens,

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.133
Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.860
he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.162
and he has his own favorite number.

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:10.105
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,

00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:12.267
the combined wealth of the people

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:14.596
on the Forbes 400 list --

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:17.993
and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:20.765
was 300 billion dollars.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.966
Just think about it.

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.993
You didn't even need to be a billionaire

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.966
to get on that list in 1992.

00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:30.979
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.865
to 1.7 trillion,

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:36.043
and I probably don't need to tell you

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:38.504
that we haven't seen anything similar happen

00:02:38.504 --> 00:02:39.889
to the middle class,

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.590
whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.650
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.691
but we've been slow to notice it.

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.374
One of the reasons, I think,

00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:55.352
is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:57.915
Changes which are slow and gradual

00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:59.455
can be hard to notice

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:02.359
even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.591
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.406
But I think there's something else going on.

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:10.516
Talking about income inequality,

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:13.047
even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.188
can make us feel uncomfortable.

00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:18.633
It feels less positive, less optimistic,

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.162
to talk about how the pie is sliced

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:24.214
than to think about how to make the pie bigger.

00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:26.942
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.740
talking about income distribution,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.427
and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:35.967
can be downright threatening.

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:40.243
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,

00:03:40.243 --> 00:03:42.356
especially at the top.

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:45.944
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?

00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:49.610
One set of causes is political:

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.205
lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:04:00.335
privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:02.775
all of these have contributed

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.892
to more and more income going to the very, very top.

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.315
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.644
under the category of "crony capitalism,"

00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:15.821
political changes that benefit a group

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.983
of well-connected insiders

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:21.521
but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.

00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.910
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.951
is incredibly difficult.

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.444
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:33.838
have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,

00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:36.867
or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:40.024
even after the most profound financial crisis

00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:41.646
since the Great Depression,

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:46.242
or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:50.253
including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"

00:04:50.253 --> 00:04:53.027
to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:55.135
paid by the middle class.

00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:58.171
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice

00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:00.167
is really, really hard,

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.635
at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:09.284
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.

00:05:09.284 --> 00:05:11.931
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues

00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:15.166
that unites the left and the right.

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.986
A critique of crony capitalism is as central

00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:22.283
to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:26.621
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,

00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:28.656
the easy part of the problem,

00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:31.931
things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.684
of surging income inequality.

00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:38.423
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.

00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:41.470
Globalization and the technology revolution,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.010
the twin economic transformations

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.708
which are changing our lives

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:47.805
and transforming the global economy,

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:51.272
are also powering the rise of the super-rich.

00:05:51.272 --> 00:05:52.852
Just think about it.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.840
For the first time in history,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.579
if you are an energetic entrepreneur

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.278
with a brilliant new idea

00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:01.693
or a fantastic new product,

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:05.372
you have almost instant, almost frictionless access

00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:09.352
to a global market of more than a billion people.

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:13.186
As a result, if you are very, very smart

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:14.981
and very, very lucky,

00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:17.832
you can get very, very rich

00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:20.362
very, very quickly.

00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:23.204
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:25.184
is David Karp.

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:28.039
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.821
recently sold his company to Yahoo

00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:33.854
for 1.1 billion dollars.

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:35.392
Think about that for a minute:

00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:39.806
1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:43.253
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution

00:06:43.253 --> 00:06:46.874
and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:48.817
in highly visible fields,

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:51.120
like sports and entertainment.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.495
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:58.839
or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.507
across the global economy as never before.

00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:04.587
But today, that superstar effect

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.569
is happening across the entire economy.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.746
We have superstar technologists.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:11.467
We have superstar bankers.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:14.803
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.232
There are superstar cooks

00:07:16.232 --> 00:07:17.744
and superstar farmers.

00:07:17.744 --> 00:07:20.527
There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,

00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:22.518
superstar dentists,

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:24.622
the most dazzling exemplar of whom

00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:27.984
is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:30.303
to the smiles of fellow superstars

00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:32.984
like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich

00:07:32.984 --> 00:07:35.845
or European-born American fashion designer

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:37.890
Diane von Furstenberg.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.973
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization

00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:42.885
and the technology revolution

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:45.356
are creating this global plutocracy,

00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:49.523
what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.

00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:51.049
And that's because,

00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:53.426
in contrast with crony capitalism,

00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:57.336
so much of what globalization and the technology revolution

00:07:57.336 --> 00:07:59.699
have done is highly positive.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.434
Let's start with technology.

00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:05.044
I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.

00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:06.878
I love the fact that they mean that

00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:10.564
whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:12.611
far beyond this auditorium.

00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:15.720
I'm even more of a fan of globalization.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.707
This is the transformation

00:08:17.707 --> 00:08:20.131
which has lifted hundreds of millions

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:23.180
of the world's poorest people out of poverty

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.622
and into the middle class,

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:27.664
and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,

00:08:27.664 --> 00:08:31.171
it's made many new products affordable --

00:08:31.171 --> 00:08:33.697
who do you think built your iPhone? —

00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:37.519
and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.143
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.

00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:42.679
So what's not to like?

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.571
Well, a few things.

00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:46.675
One of the things that worries me

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:50.838
is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy

00:08:50.838 --> 00:08:53.534
can become crony plutocracy.

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.193
Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur

00:08:56.193 --> 00:08:59.570
who has successfully sold that idea or that product

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.949
to the global billions

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:03.515
and become a billionaire in the process.

00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:05.884
It gets tempting at that point

00:09:05.884 --> 00:09:08.859
to use your economic nous

00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:13.131
to manipulate the rules of the global political economy

00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:15.217
in your own favor.

00:09:15.217 --> 00:09:17.966
And that's no mere hypothetical example.

00:09:17.966 --> 00:09:22.395
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.499
These are among the world's most admired,

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:27.045
most beloved, most innovative companies.

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:29.969
They also happen to be particularly adept

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:32.207
at working the international tax system

00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:36.765
so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.

00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:41.080
And why stop at just playing the global political

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.168
and economic system as it exists

00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:45.313
to your own maximum advantage?

00:09:45.313 --> 00:09:49.630
Once you have the tremendous economic power

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.703
that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution

00:09:52.703 --> 00:09:55.953
and the political power that inevitably entails,

00:09:55.953 --> 00:09:58.466
it becomes tempting as well

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:02.054
to start trying to change the rules of the game

00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:04.156
in your own favor.

00:10:04.156 --> 00:10:06.890
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.825
It's what the Russian oligarchs did

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:12.087
in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:14.057
of Russia's natural resources.

00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:15.831
It's one way of describing what happened

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:17.866
with deregulation of the financial services

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:20.101
in the U.S. and the U.K.

00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:22.027
A second thing that worries me

00:10:22.027 --> 00:10:24.758
is how easily meritocratic plutocracy

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:27.504
can become aristocracy.

00:10:27.504 --> 00:10:29.579
One way of describing the plutocrats

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:31.386
is as alpha geeks,

00:10:31.386 --> 00:10:33.900
and they are people who are acutely aware

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.308
of how important highly sophisticated

00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:40.490
analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.909
That's why they are spending

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.686
unprecedented time and resources

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.583
educating their own children.

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:50.850
The middle class is spending more on schooling too,

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.211
but in the global educational arms race

00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:54.995
that starts at nursery school

00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:58.733
and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:02.211
the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:03.750
by the One Percent.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.456
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:10.161
and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.

00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:12.964
As income inequality increases,

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.737
social mobility decreases.

00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:18.495
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,

00:11:18.495 --> 00:11:20.711
but increasingly you have to be born

00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:25.595
on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.

00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:28.619
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:32.970
is the extent to which those same largely positive forces

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.160
which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.592
also happen to be hollowing out the middle class

00:11:39.592 --> 00:11:42.546
in Western industrialized economies.

00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:44.633
Let's start with technology.

00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:47.706
Those same forces that are creating billionaires

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:51.729
are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.

00:11:51.729 --> 00:11:54.668
When's the last time you used a travel agent?

00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:57.749
And in contrast with the industrial revolution,

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.905
the titans of our new economy

00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:02.707
aren't creating that many new jobs.

00:12:02.707 --> 00:12:06.526
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:09.549
Facebook fewer than 10,000.

00:12:09.549 --> 00:12:12.219
The same is true of globalization.

00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:15.462
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people

00:12:15.462 --> 00:12:17.802
out of poverty in the emerging markets,

00:12:17.802 --> 00:12:20.668
it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs

00:12:20.668 --> 00:12:22.969
from the developed Western economies.

00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:25.736
The terrifying reality is

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:27.993
that there is no economic rule

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:30.930
which automatically translates

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.633
increased economic growth

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:34.943
into widely shared prosperity.

00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:37.617
That's shown in what I consider to be

00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:41.300
the most scary economic statistic of our time.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.358
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity

00:12:45.358 --> 00:12:48.020
have been decoupled from increases

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:49.970
in wages and employment.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.914
That means that our countries are getting richer,

00:12:52.914 --> 00:12:55.538
our companies are getting more efficient,

00:12:55.538 --> 00:12:57.479
but we're not creating more jobs

00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:01.350
and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.559
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:09.270
is to worry about structural unemployment.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.057
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:15.649
After all, in a totally free labor market,

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:18.851
we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.

00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:20.879
The dystopia that worries me

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:24.525
is a universe in which a few geniuses

00:13:24.525 --> 00:13:26.605
invent Google and its ilk

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:31.800
and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.433
So when I get really depressed about all of this,

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:38.262
I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.

00:13:38.262 --> 00:13:42.157
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,

00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:44.657
it worked out pretty well, didn't it?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:51.680
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.706
well, there are a few exceptions —

00:13:53.706 --> 00:13:58.697
and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.

00:13:58.697 --> 00:14:01.281
But it's important to remember

00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:04.103
that before we learned how to share the fruits

00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:05.782
of the Industrial Revolution

00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:08.345
with the broad swathes of society,

00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:11.740
we had to go through two depressions,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.599
the Great Depression of the 1930s,

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:16.453
the Long Depression of the 1870s,

00:14:16.453 --> 00:14:19.620
two world wars, communist revolutions

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.699
in Russia and in China,

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.024
and an era of tremendous social

00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:26.780
and political upheaval in the West.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.500
We also, not coincidentally,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.038
went through an era of tremendous

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.617
social and political inventions.

00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:36.961
We created the modern welfare state.

00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:38.703
We created public education.

00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:40.407
We created public health care.

00:14:40.407 --> 00:14:42.182
We created public pensions.

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:44.207
We created unions.

00:14:44.207 --> 00:14:46.723
Today, we are living through an era

00:14:46.723 --> 00:14:48.684
of economic transformation

00:14:48.684 --> 00:14:51.990
comparable in its scale and its scope

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.258
to the Industrial Revolution.

00:14:54.258 --> 00:14:57.449
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:59.567
and not just the plutocrats,

00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:01.231
we need to embark on an era

00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:05.150
of comparably ambitious social and political change.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.808
We need a new New Deal.

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.808
(Applause)
