00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.611
Last year, I went on my first book tour.

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.589
In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:21.922
and gave some hundred talks.

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:24.975
Every talk in every country

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.975
began with an introduction,

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.824
and every introduction began,
alas, with a lie:

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.888
"Taiye Selasi comes
from Ghana and Nigeria,"

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:39.991
or "Taiye Selasi comes
from England and the States."

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:42.975
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.564
no matter the country that concluded it --

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.975
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.571
I thought, "But that's not true."

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:55.126
Yes, I was born in England
and grew up in the United States.

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:58.783
My mum, born in England,
and raised in Nigeria,

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:00.791
currently lives in Ghana.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:05.040
My father was born in Gold Coast,
a British colony,

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.649
raised in Ghana,

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:10.780
and has lived for over 30 years
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:15.967
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."

00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:20.466
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.481
"I'm a human being."

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:26.284
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,

00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:29.784
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark

00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:33.136
where I shared the stage
with the writer Colum McCann.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.470
We were discussing the role
of locality in writing,

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:38.673
when suddenly it hit me.

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:41.142
I'm not multinational.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.162
I'm not a national at all.

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.558
How could I come from a nation?

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.340
How can a human being come from a concept?

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:55.038
It's a question that had been bothering me
for going on two decades.

00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:58.576
From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.862
I had learned to speak of countries

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:05.649
as if they were eternal, singular,
naturally occurring things,

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:07.530
but I wondered:

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:09.326
to say that I came from a country

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.365
suggested that the country
was an absolute,

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.071
some fixed point in place in time,

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.443
a constant thing, but was it?

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:22.817
In my lifetime, countries
had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:27.200
appeared -- Timor-Leste;
failed -- Somalia.

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:31.498
My parents came from countries
that didn't exist when they were born.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:37.832
To me, a country -- this thing that could
be born, die, expand, contract --

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:41.277
hardly seemed the basis
for understanding a human being.

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:46.756
And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.170
What we call countries are actually

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:51.843
various expressions
of sovereign statehood,

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.731
an idea that came into fashion
only 400 years ago.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:03:01.181
When I learned this, beginning my
masters degree in international relations,

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:03.574
I felt a sort of surge of relief.

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:05.844
It was as I had suspected.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.023
History was real, cultures were real,

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.561
but countries were invented.

00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:17.483
For the next 10 years, I sought
to re- or un-define myself,

00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:19.975
my world, my work, my experience,

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.174
beyond the logic of the state.

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:26.737
In 2005, I wrote an essay,
"What is an Afropolitan,"

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:32.029
sketching out an identity
that privileged culture over country.

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:36.572
It was thrilling how many people
could relate to my experience,

00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:41.573
and instructional how many others
didn't buy my sense of self.

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:47.224
"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"
one such critic asked,

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:49.516
"when she's never known the indignities

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.253
of traveling abroad
on a Ghanian passport?"

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:54.975
Now, if I'm honest,

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.431
I knew just what she meant.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.448
I've got a friend named Layla
who was born and raised in Ghana.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:05.014
Her parents are third-generation
Ghanians of Lebanese descent.

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:10.506
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
knows Accra like the back of her hand,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.265
but when we first met years ago,
I thought, "She's not from Ghana."

00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:18.235
In my mind, she came from Lebanon,

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.975
despite the patent fact
that all her formative experience

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.844
took place in suburban Accra.

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:26.718
I, like my critics,

00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:32.272
was imagining some Ghana
where all Ghanaians had brown skin

00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:34.807
or none held U.K. passports.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.426
I'd fallen into the limiting trap

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.621
that the language of coming
from countries sets --

00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:44.376
the privileging of a fiction,
the singular country,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.609
over reality: human experience.

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:53.029
Speaking with Colum McCann that day,
the penny finally dropped.

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:56.177
"All experience is local," he said.

00:04:56.788 --> 00:05:00.391
"All identity is experience," I thought.

00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:04.297
"I'm not a national,"
I proclaimed onstage.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.510
"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:12.023
See, "Taiye Selasi comes
from the United States," isn't the truth.

00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:15.229
I have no relationship
with the United States,

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:17.418
all 50 of them, not really.

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.614
My relationship is with Brookline,
the town where I grew up;

00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:24.179
with New York City, where I started work;

00:05:24.203 --> 00:05:26.987
with Lawrenceville,
where I spend Thanksgiving.

00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:33.037
What makes America home for me
is not my passport or accent,

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.697
but these very particular experiences

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:37.679
and the places they occur.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:40.807
Despite my pride in Ewe culture,

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:43.975
the Black Stars,
and my love of Ghanaian food,

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:48.357
I've never had a relationship
with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:52.393
My relationship is with Accra,
where my mother lives,

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.028
where I go each year,

00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:58.448
with the little garden in Dzorwulu
where my father and I talk for hours.

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:02.171
These are the places
that shape my experience.

00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:04.956
My experience is where I'm from.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:09.378
What if we asked, instead
of "Where are you from?" --

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:11.586
"Where are you a local?"

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.023
This would tell us so much more
about who and how similar we are.

00:06:16.047 --> 00:06:20.631
Tell me you're from France,
and I see what, a set of clichés?

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:24.895
Adichie's dangerous single story,
the myth of the nation of France?

00:06:25.355 --> 00:06:28.589
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:32.978
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
a set of experiences.

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:35.975
Our experience is where we're from.

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.046
So, where are you a local?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.141
I propose a three-step test.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:46.262
I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:50.533
First, think of your daily rituals,
whatever they may be:

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.590
making your coffee, driving to work,

00:06:52.614 --> 00:06:55.490
harvesting your crops,
saying your prayers.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:57.736
What kind of rituals are these?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.213
Where do they occur?

00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:03.876
In what city or cities in the world
do shopkeepers know your face?

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:08.975
As a child, I carried out fairly standard
suburban rituals in Boston,

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:13.630
with adjustments made for the rituals
my mother brought from London and Lagos.

00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:15.501
We took off our shoes in the house,

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:18.215
we were unfailingly
polite with our elders,

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:20.476
we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:25.561
In snowy North America,
ours were rituals of the global South.

00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:29.975
The first time I went to Delhi
or to southern parts of Italy,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.335
I was shocked by how at home I felt.

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:34.490
The rituals were familiar.

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:37.078
"R" number one, rituals.

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:41.692
Now, think of your relationships,
of the people who shape your days.

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:44.605
To whom do you speak at least once a week,

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.429
be it face to face or on FaceTime?

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:49.159
Be reasonable in your assessment;

00:07:49.183 --> 00:07:52.040
I'm not talking about
your Facebook friends.

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:56.347
I'm speaking of the people who shape
your weekly emotional experience.

00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.975
My mother in Accra,
my twin sister in Boston,

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.041
my best friends in New York:

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:03.410
these relationships are home for me.

00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:06.109
"R" number two, relationships.

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:10.975
We're local where we carry out
our rituals and relationships,

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.741
but how we experience our locality

00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:17.051
depends in part on our restrictions.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:19.918
By restrictions, I mean,
where are you able to live?

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:21.975
What passport do you hold?

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:27.266
Are you restricted by, say, racism,
from feeling fully at home where you live?

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.553
By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
economic inflation,

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:35.975
from living in the locality
where you had your rituals as a child?

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:38.993
This is the least sexy of the R’s,

00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:41.975
less lyric than rituals and relationships,

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:45.309
but the question takes us past
"Where are you now?"

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:48.357
to "Why aren't you there, and why?"

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:52.011
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.

00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:54.028
Take a piece of paper

00:08:54.052 --> 00:08:57.344
and put those three words
on top of three columns,

00:08:57.368 --> 00:09:00.684
then try to fill those columns
as honestly as you can.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:05.202
A very different picture
of your life in local context,

00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:08.640
of your identity as a set of experiences,

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:09.824
may emerge.

00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:11.064
So let's try it.

00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:12.853
I have a friend named Olu.

00:09:12.877 --> 00:09:14.472
He's 35 years old.

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:18.441
His parents, born in Nigeria,
came to Germany on scholarships.

00:09:18.465 --> 00:09:22.026
Olu was born in Nuremberg
and lived there until age 10.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.843
When his family moved to Lagos,
he studied in London,

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:26.292
then came to Berlin.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.975
He loves going to Nigeria --

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:31.633
the weather, the food, the friends --

00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:34.171
but hates the political corruption there.

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:35.855
Where is Olu from?

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:38.617
I have another friend named Udo.

00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.148
He's also 35 years old.

00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:43.823
Udo was born in Córdoba,
in northwest Argentina,

00:09:43.847 --> 00:09:47.035
where his grandparents migrated
from Germany, what is now Poland,

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:48.487
after the war.

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:52.393
Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
and nine years ago came to Berlin.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:56.618
He loves going to Argentina -- 
the weather, the food, the friends --

00:09:56.642 --> 00:09:59.102
but hates the economic corruption there.

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:01.405
Where is Udo from?

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:05.062
With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
Udo could pass for German,

00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:09.142
but holds an Argentinian passport,
so needs a visa to live in Berlin.

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:13.475
That Udo is from Argentina
has largely to do with history.

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:16.656
That he's a local
of Buenos Aires and Berlin,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.465
that has to do with life.

00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:22.975
Olu, who looks Nigerian,
needs a visa to visit Nigeria.

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:25.390
He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,

00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:27.493
and English with a German one.

00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:30.058
To claim that he's
"not really Nigerian," though,

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:32.410
denies his experience in Lagos,

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.617
the rituals he practiced growing up,

00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:37.070
his relationship with family and friends.

00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.452
Meanwhile, though Lagos
is undoubtedly one of his homes,

00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:43.975
Olu always feels restricted there,

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:46.268
not least by the fact that he's gay.

00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:50.950
Both he and Udo are restricted
by the political conditions

00:10:50.975 --> 00:10:52.628
of their parents' countries,

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.636
from living where some of their
most meaningful rituals

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.610
and relationships occur.

00:10:57.634 --> 00:11:01.735
To say Olu is from Nigeria
and Udo is from Argentina

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:03.872
distracts from their common experience.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:07.511
Their rituals, their relationships,
and their restrictions are the same.

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:10.560
Of course, when we ask,
"Where are you from?"

00:11:10.584 --> 00:11:12.505
we're using a kind of shorthand.

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:16.456
It's quicker to say "Nigeria"
than "Lagos and Berlin,"

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:20.747
and as with Google Maps,
we can always zoom in closer,

00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.231
from country to city to neighborhood.

00:11:23.255 --> 00:11:25.548
But that's not quite the point.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.899
The difference between
"Where are you from?"

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:30.439
and "Where are you a local?"

00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:33.425
isn't the specificity of the answer;

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:35.564
it's the intention of the question.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.181
Replacing the language of nationality
with the language of locality asks us

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:44.897
to shift our focus
to where real life occurs.

00:11:45.349 --> 00:11:49.566
Even that most glorious expression
of countryhood, the World Cup,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:55.286
gives us national teams comprised
mostly of multilocal players.

00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:58.176
As a unit of measurement
for human experience,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.975
the country doesn't quite work.

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:04.852
That's why Olu says, "I'm German,
but my parents come from Nigeria."

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:10.605
The "but" in that sentence
belies the inflexibility of the units,

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:14.767
one fixed and fictional entity
bumping up against another.

00:12:15.164 --> 00:12:19.586
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"
suggests overlapping experiences,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.835
layers that merge together,
that can't be denied or removed.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.408
You can take away my passport,

00:12:26.432 --> 00:12:28.539
but you can't take away my experience.

00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:30.674
That I carry within me.

00:12:30.698 --> 00:12:33.340
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.620
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
that we do away with countries.

00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:39.778
There's much to be said
for national history,

00:12:39.803 --> 00:12:41.764
more for the sovereign state.

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:46.485
Culture exists in community,
and community exists in context.

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:50.475
Geography, tradition, collective memory:
these things are important.

00:12:51.006 --> 00:12:53.514
What I'm questioning is primacy.

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:58.663
All of those introductions on tour
began with reference to nation,

00:12:58.687 --> 00:13:03.010
as if knowing what country I came
from would tell my audience who I was.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.415
What are we really seeking, though,
when we ask where someone comes from?

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:10.380
And what are we really seeing
when we hear an answer?

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.270
Here's one possibility:

00:13:12.294 --> 00:13:15.064
basically, countries represent power.

00:13:15.588 --> 00:13:20.163
"Where are you from?"
Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.

00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:24.165
America. Germany. Japan. More power.

00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:27.076
China. Russia. Ambiguous.

00:13:27.703 --> 00:13:29.363
(Laughter)

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:33.048
It's possible that without realizing it,
we're playing a power game,

00:13:33.072 --> 00:13:36.413
especially in the context
of multi-ethnic countries.

00:13:36.437 --> 00:13:38.706
As any recent immigrant knows,

00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:42.975
the question "Where are you from?"
or "Where are you really from?"

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:45.468
is often code for "Why are you here?"

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:49.436
Then we have the scholar
William Deresiewicz's writing

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.233
of elite American colleges.

00:13:51.257 --> 00:13:54.408
"Students think that
their environment is diverse

00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:57.687
if one comes from Missouri
and another from Pakistan --

00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:01.749
never mind that all of their parents
are doctors or bankers."

00:14:02.114 --> 00:14:03.273
I'm with him.

00:14:03.297 --> 00:14:06.768
To call one student American,
another Pakistani,

00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:10.053
then triumphantly claim
student body diversity

00:14:10.077 --> 00:14:13.720
ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.

00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:17.093
The same holds true on the other end
of the economic spectrum.

00:14:17.593 --> 00:14:22.265
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi

00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:26.112
have more in common
in terms of rituals and restrictions

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:27.922
than nationality implies.

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:31.541
Perhaps my biggest problem
with coming from countries

00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:33.279
is the myth of going back to them.

00:14:33.303 --> 00:14:36.398
I'm often asked if I plan
to "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:40.742
I go to Accra every year,
but I can't "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.567
It's not because I wasn't born there.

00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:44.924
My father can't go back, either.

00:14:44.948 --> 00:14:46.975
The country in which he was born,

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:49.333
that country no longer exists.

00:14:49.357 --> 00:14:53.192
We can never go back to a place
and find it exactly where we left it.

00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:56.064
Something, somewhere
will always have changed,

00:14:56.088 --> 00:14:57.984
most of all, ourselves.

00:14:58.738 --> 00:14:59.960
People.

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:02.532
Finally, what we're talking
about is human experience,

00:15:02.556 --> 00:15:06.419
this notoriously and gloriously
disorderly affair.

00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:10.286
In creative writing,
locality bespeaks humanity.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.587
The more we know
about where a story is set,

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.975
the more local color and texture,

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.476
the more human
the characters start to feel,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.776
the more relatable, not less.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.244
The myth of national identity
and the vocabulary of coming from

00:15:24.268 --> 00:15:29.230
confuses us into placing ourselves
into mutually exclusive categories.

00:15:29.254 --> 00:15:33.559
In fact, all of us are multi --
multi-local, multi-layered.

00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:37.367
To begin our conversations
with an acknowledgement of this complexity

00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:40.972
brings us closer together, I think,
not further apart.

00:15:40.996 --> 00:15:44.298
So the next time that I'm introduced,

00:15:44.322 --> 00:15:46.171
I'd love to hear the truth:

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:50.202
"Taiye Selasi is a human being,
like everybody here.

00:15:50.226 --> 00:15:54.284
She isn't a citizen of the world,
but a citizen of worlds.

00:15:54.308 --> 00:15:57.069
She is a local of New York,
Rome and Accra."

00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:58.572
Thank you.

00:15:58.596 --> 00:16:02.999
(Applause)
