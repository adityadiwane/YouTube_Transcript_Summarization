00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:13.530
So the machine I'm going to talk you about

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.204
is what I call the greatest machine that never was.

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:17.203
It was a machine that was never built,

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:19.583
and yet, it will be built.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.575
It was a machine that was designed

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:23.926
long before anyone thought about computers.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:26.075
If you know anything about the history of computers,

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.595
you will know that in the '30s and the '40s,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.150
simple computers were created

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.943
that started the computer revolution we have today,

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:35.229
and you would be correct,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.711
except for you'd have the wrong century.

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.351
The first computer was really designed

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:43.023
in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.351
It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.487
and the bits of it that were built are here

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:49.480
in South Kensington.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.799
That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.555
Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.164
because his hair is always completely unkempt like this

00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:59.505
in every single picture. (Laughter)

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.352
He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.365
part of the aristocracy of Britain,

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.704
and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.135
were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.631
you would have been invited round to his house

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.590
for a soiree — and he invited everybody:

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.022
kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:18.543
and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:21.583
I really miss that era, you know, where you could

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.931
go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer

00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:25.044
get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)

00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:28.310
But Babbage, Babbage himself was born

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.044
at the end of the 18th century,

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:32.088
and was a fairly famous mathematician.

00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:35.231
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:37.743
and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:40.598
He's less well known than either of them because

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:43.748
he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:46.033
and never made any of them.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.318
The reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.329
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think,

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.777
"That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:55.372
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.

00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:57.732
I'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."

00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:00.612
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,

00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:03.076
basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:05.517
and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:08.669
"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.649
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.088
the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,

00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:15.960
this is a view from above.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.073
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:22.309
and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.300
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.944
this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:28.704
of what this thing would have sounded like.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.481
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:31.960
— that's why it's computer architecture —

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.287
and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.690
So let's talk about the memory. The memory

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.937
is very like the memory of a computer today,

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:43.639
except it was all made out of metal,

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.183
stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.

00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:49.253
Imagine a thing this high of cogs,

00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:51.008
hundreds and hundreds of them,

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:52.898
and they've got numbers on them.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:55.317
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:56.902
And he thought about using binary. The problem

00:02:56.902 --> 00:02:58.620
with using binary is that the machine would have been so

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.937
tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.

00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:03.996
So he's got memory.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.403
The memory is this bit over here.

00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:08.733
You see it all like this.

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:13.268
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:15.518
Of course, it's this big.

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.431
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.572
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.711
which is in the Science Museum.

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:28.343
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic --

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.796
so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division --

00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:33.804
which already is a bit of a feat in metal,

00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:36.433
but it could also do something that a computer does

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.132
and a calculator doesn't:

00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:42.070
this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.936
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers,

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.076
and that fundamentally made it into a computer.

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:51.674
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:54.355
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:56.226
and we think about chips today, we can't

00:03:56.226 --> 00:04:00.041
look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.842
Yet if you did, you would see something

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.664
very, very similar to this.

00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:06.611
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU,

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.303
and this incredible regularity in the memory.

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:10.965
If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:12.934
you'll see this. This all looks the same,

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.500
then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.483
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,

00:04:19.483 --> 00:04:21.576
but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,

00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:24.601
Babbage used the technology of the day

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.247
and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:31.116
which is punch cards. This thing over here

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:33.940
is one of three punch card readers in here,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.620
and this is a program in the Science Museum, just

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.013
not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,

00:04:42.013 --> 00:04:43.881
that is sitting there — you can go see it —

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:46.322
waiting for the machine to be built.

00:04:46.322 --> 00:04:49.742
And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.

00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:52.832
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.

00:04:52.832 --> 00:04:54.805
Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.977
in France, had created the Jacquard loom,

00:04:56.977 --> 00:04:59.655
which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,

00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:02.287
so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,

00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:04.392
and like everything else he did, he's using the technology

00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:09.139
of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.077
mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year

00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:15.249
as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.926
who would completely revolutionize everything

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:20.439
with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.597
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:25.150
so steam and things.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.823
Now, he needed accessories.

00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:28.495
Obviously, you've got a computer now.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.884
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.

00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:32.819
You need accessories you're going to come with.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.447
You're not just going to have that,

00:05:34.447 --> 00:05:37.275
So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.429
so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:41.774
or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.744
there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.280
And there's actually an instruction on the punch card

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.182
which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.382
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:51.463
this thing, "Click, clack click click click,"

00:05:51.463 --> 00:05:54.400
steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.835
You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.

00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:59.843
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for

00:05:59.843 --> 00:06:02.326
another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:04.261
which he never built, but which the Science Museum

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.432
did build in the '80s and '90s.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.707
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.

00:06:08.707 --> 00:06:11.405
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.922
but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:17.694
so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.

00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:19.344
You also need graphics, right?

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:20.900
I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.496
so he said, "Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper

00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:25.604
and an ink pen and I'll make it plot."

00:06:25.604 --> 00:06:27.434
So he designed a plotter as well,

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:31.359
and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:32.890
a pretty good machine.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.580
Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.301
Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.

00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.393
This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:43.815
and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,

00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:46.335
and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:49.192
inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:52.430
thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.379
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.135
(Laughter) Because of course,

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:03.050
there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.451
so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)

00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.789
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.527
and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,

00:07:11.527 --> 00:07:14.317
and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:16.151
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,

00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:17.723
get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,

00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:21.474
and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:22.766
who said, "I understand what this does,

00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:24.973
and I understand the future of this machine."

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:28.060
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.037
a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build

00:07:31.037 --> 00:07:32.640
because of her.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.397
Now, some people call her the first programmer.

00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:38.783
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.

00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:41.694
This is a program written in a particular style.

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:45.263
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.316
and actually, she did something more amazing.

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:48.886
Rather than just being a programmer,

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:51.058
she saw something that Babbage didn't.

00:07:51.058 --> 00:07:54.242
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.

00:07:54.242 --> 00:07:58.191
He was building a machine to do mathematics,

00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:01.450
and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.285
on this machine." And just as you do,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:05.910
everyone in this room already's got a computer on them

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.964
right now, because they've got a phone.

00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:10.192
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone

00:08:10.192 --> 00:08:12.207
or computer or any other computing device

00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:14.288
is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:18.981
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,

00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.961
it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.066
and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:28.388
mathematical functions and symbols

00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:30.635
doesn't mean these things can't represent

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.988
other things in the real world, such as music."

00:08:33.988 --> 00:08:36.722
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:38.944
"We could compute these amazing functions and print out

00:08:38.944 --> 00:08:42.612
tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) —

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:44.508
and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,

00:08:44.508 --> 00:08:46.984
this thing could even compose music if you

00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:50.532
told it a representation of music numerically."

00:08:50.532 --> 00:08:52.101
So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.

00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:55.838
When you say she's a programmer, she did do some,

00:08:55.838 --> 00:08:58.975
but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:01.171
much, much more than this.

00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:03.350
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.803
Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.

00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:11.380
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.911
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.

00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:16.702
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,

00:09:16.702 --> 00:09:19.255
but Turing told us something very important.

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:22.190
He laid down the mathematical foundations

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.303
for computer science, and said,

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:27.490
"It doesn't matter how you make a computer."

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.368
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:33.778
like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.582
or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,

00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:39.728
mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:41.765
We could go back to Babbage's machine

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:44.341
and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.

00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.973
There is in a sense a computing essence.

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:47.978
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.

00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:50.645
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:52.868
this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.

00:09:52.868 --> 00:09:55.693
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today

00:09:55.693 --> 00:10:00.525
with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:02.631
To give you an idea of how slowly,

00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:06.470
it had about 1k of memory.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.388
It used punch cards, which were being fed in,

00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:15.148
and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:16.751
It did have a RAM pack.

00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:19.930
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.256
(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:23.864
So there are plans.

00:10:23.864 --> 00:10:26.797
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,

00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:28.491
there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages

00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:31.960
of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.921
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,

00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:38.075
and that is also the name of a charity that I started

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:40.809
with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing

00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:43.048
at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:44.478
the project to build a difference engine,

00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:47.036
and our plan is to build it.

00:10:47.036 --> 00:10:50.902
Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:52.904
The project has a number of parts to it.

00:10:52.904 --> 00:10:55.424
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.

00:10:55.424 --> 00:10:57.346
That's been done. The second is now the study

00:10:57.346 --> 00:11:00.456
of all of those plans to determine what to build.

00:11:00.456 --> 00:11:04.900
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.823
and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.

00:11:07.823 --> 00:11:10.399
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.233
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,

00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:14.843
you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,

00:11:14.843 --> 00:11:18.178
I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:22.045
I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)

00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:24.644
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.

00:11:24.644 --> 00:11:26.401
Babbage himself wrote, he said,

00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:28.019
as soon as the analytical engine exists,

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:31.723
it will surely guide the future course of science.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:33.568
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.650
with new plans, but when it did get built, of course,

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.160
in the 1940s, everything changed.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.983
Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like

00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:43.616
in motion with a video which shows

00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:48.210
just one part of the CPU mechanism working.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.209
So this is just three sets of cogs,

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:57.031
and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism

00:11:57.031 --> 00:11:59.688
in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.

00:11:59.688 --> 00:12:00.847
So, give me five years.

00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:03.191
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.

00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:06.161
Thank you very much. (Applause)
