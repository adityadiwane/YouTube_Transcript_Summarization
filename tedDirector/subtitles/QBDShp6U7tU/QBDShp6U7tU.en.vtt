00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:14.497
Einstein said that

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:17.954
"I never think about the future â€”
it comes soon enough."

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:19.655
And he was right, of course.

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:22.199
So today, I'm here to ask you to think of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.059
how the future is happening now.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.822
Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:29.752
two major waves of innovation.

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:31.981
First, the Industrial Revolution

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.502
brought us machines and factories, railways,

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:36.832
electricity, air travel,

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:39.152
and our lives have never been the same.

00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:41.578
Then the Internet revolution

00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:44.811
brought us computing power, data networks,

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.146
unprecedented access

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.499
to information and communication,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.774
and our lives have never been the same.

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.387
Now we are experiencing

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.151
another metamorphic change:

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:58.338
the industrial Internet.

00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:01.313
It brings together intelligent machines,

00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:02.853
advanced analytics,

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:05.219
and the creativity of people at work.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.419
It's the marriage of minds and machines.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:10.975
And our lives will never be the same.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.968
In my current role, I see up close

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:16.801
how technology is beginning to transform

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.332
industrial sectors that play a huge role

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:21.725
in our economy and in our lives:

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:26.412
energy, aviation, transportation, health care.

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.703
For an economist, this is highly unusual,

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:30.242
and it's extremely exciting,

00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:32.131
because this is a transformation

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.153
as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,

00:01:36.153 --> 00:01:37.612
and before the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:40.562
there was no economic growth to speak of.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:43.917
So what is this industrial Internet?

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.780
Industrial machines are being equipped

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.040
with a growing number of electronic sensors

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.489
that allow them to see, hear, feel

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.195
a lot more than ever before,

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.266
generating prodigious amounts of data.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.233
Increasingly sophisticated analytics

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.074
then sift through the data,

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:02.830
providing insights that allow us

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.864
to operate the machines in entirely new ways,

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:07.770
a lot more efficiently.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.759
And not just individual machines,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.544
but fleets of locomotives, airplanes,

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:15.716
entire systems like power grids, hospitals.

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:19.942
It is asset optimization and system optimization.

00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:21.952
Of course, electronic sensors

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:23.657
have been around for some time,

00:02:23.657 --> 00:02:25.569
but something has changed:

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.420
a sharp decline in the cost of sensors

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.897
and, thanks to advances in cloud computing,

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:33.913
a rapid decrease in the cost of storing

00:02:33.913 --> 00:02:36.280
and processing data.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.990
So we are moving to a world

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.783
where the machines we work with

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:44.024
are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.

00:02:44.024 --> 00:02:46.782
They are self-aware, they are predictive,

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:50.141
reactive and social.

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:54.099
It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.880
medical devices, communicating seamlessly

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.205
with each other and with us.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:01.209
It's a world where information itself

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.396
becomes intelligent and comes to us

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:05.325
automatically when we need it

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:08.523
without having to look for it.

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.050
We are beginning to deploy

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.505
throughout the industrial system

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:14.550
embedded virtualization,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.752
multi-core processor technology,

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:20.192
advanced cloud-based communications,

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:22.934
a new software-defined machine infrastructure

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.678
which allows machine functionality

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:28.252
to become virtualized in software,

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:31.414
decoupling machine software from hardware,

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:35.021
and allowing us to remotely and automatically

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:40.345
monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.479
Why does any of this matter at all?

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.950
Well first of all, it's already allowing us

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.151
to shift towards preventive,

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.029
condition-based maintenance,

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.991
which means fixing machines

00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.279
just before they break,

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.295
without wasting time

00:03:56.295 --> 00:03:58.623
servicing them on a fixed schedule.

00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:02.260
And this, in turn, is pushing us towards

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.115
zero unplanned downtime,

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:06.980
which means there will be no more power outages,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.020
no more flight delays.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.664
So let me give you a few examples

00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:12.543
of how these brilliant machines work,

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.841
and some of the examples may seem trivial,

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:16.837
some are clearly more profound,

00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:20.962
but all of them are going to
have a very powerful impact.

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.916
Let's start with aviation.

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:25.184
Today, 10 percent of all flights

00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:27.302
cancellations and delays

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.003
are due to unscheduled maintenance events.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.035
Something goes wrong unexpectedly.

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:35.231
This results in eight billion dollars in costs

00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.643
for the airline industry globally every year,

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.945
not to mention the impact on all of us:

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.030
stress, inconvenience,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.925
missed meetings as we sit helplessly

00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:46.834
in an airport terminal.

00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:50.252
So how can the industrial Internet help here?

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:52.887
We've developed a preventive maintenance system

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:54.877
which can be installed on any aircraft.

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:58.128
It's self-learning and able to predict issues

00:04:58.128 --> 00:05:01.084
that a human operator would miss.

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:03.438
The aircraft, while in flight,

00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:05.788
will communicate with technicians on the ground.

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:07.748
By the time it lands, they will already know

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:10.234
if anything needs to be serviced.

00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:13.850
Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.557
over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,

00:05:17.557 --> 00:05:19.519
helping seven million passengers

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.055
get to their destinations on time.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.708
Or take healthcare.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.439
Today, nurses spend an average

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.082
of 21 minutes per shift

00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:29.775
looking for medical equipment.

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:34.158
That seems trivial, but it's less time spent

00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:36.867
caring for patients.

00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.741
St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,

00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:42.668
which has deployed industrial Internet technology

00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:44.733
to electronically monitor and connect

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:47.932
patients, staff and medical equipment,

00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:50.242
has reduced bed turnaround times

00:05:50.242 --> 00:05:51.977
by nearly one hour.

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:54.787
If you need surgery, one hour matters.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.114
It means more patients can be treated,

00:05:57.114 --> 00:05:59.104
more lives can be saved.

00:05:59.104 --> 00:06:02.068
Another medical center, in Washington state,

00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:03.956
is piloting an application that allows

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:07.049
medical images from city scanners and MRIs

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:09.164
to be analyzed in the cloud,

00:06:09.164 --> 00:06:11.801
developing better analytics

00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:14.362
at a lower cost.

00:06:14.362 --> 00:06:15.986
Imagine a patient

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:17.420
who has suffered a severe trauma,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.175
and needs the attention of several specialists:

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:21.984
a neurologist, a cardiologist,

00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:23.595
an orthopedic surgeon.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:26.921
If all of them can have instantaneous
and simultaneous access

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:29.707
to scans and images as they are taken,

00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:34.404
they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.

00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:37.483
So all of this translates into better health outcomes,

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:40.923
but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:44.409
Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.915
could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:50.712
to the healthcare industry worldwide,

00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:53.071
and that is just a drop in the sea

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:55.807
compared to what we need to do to make healthcare

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:58.228
affordable on a sustainable basis.

00:06:58.228 --> 00:07:00.486
Similar advances are happening in energy,

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.956
including renewable energy.

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:07.659
Wind farms equipped with new
remote monitorings and diagnostics

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.254
that allow wind turbines to talk to each other

00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:14.103
and adjust the pitch of their
blades in a coordinated way,

00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:16.222
depending on how the wind is blowing,

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:18.198
can now produce electricity at a cost

00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:21.376
of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.

00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:23.393
Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents,

00:07:23.393 --> 00:07:25.345
six times as much.

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:28.249
The list goes on, and it will grow fast,

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:30.950
because industrial data are
now growing exponentially.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.802
By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent

00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:36.030
of all digital information.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.209
But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.050
and tell you how this is impacting already

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.493
the jobs we do every day,

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:45.214
because this new wave of innovation

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.330
is bringing about new tools and applications

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.846
that will allow us to collaborate

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.416
in a smarter and faster way,

00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:55.549
making our jobs not just more efficient

00:07:55.549 --> 00:07:57.338
but more rewarding.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:00.242
Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm

00:08:00.242 --> 00:08:01.928
with a handheld device telling her

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:04.226
which turbines need servicing.

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:05.704
She already has all the spare parts,

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:08.246
because the problems were diagnosed in advanced.

00:08:08.246 --> 00:08:10.720
And if she faces an unexpected issue,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.323
the same handheld device will allow her to

00:08:13.323 --> 00:08:15.831
communicate with colleagues at the service center,

00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:17.931
let them see what she sees,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.686
transmit data that they can run through diagnostics,

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.983
and they can stream videos that will guide her,

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.351
step by step, through whatever complex procedure

00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:27.813
is needed to get the machines back up and running.

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:29.829
And their interaction gets documented

00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:34.231
and stored in a searchable database.

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:36.001
Let's stop and think about this for a minute,

00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:37.722
because this is a very important point.

00:08:37.722 --> 00:08:39.948
This new wave of innovation is fundamentally

00:08:39.948 --> 00:08:42.418
changing the way we work.

00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:47.627
And I know that many of you will be concerned 
about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.124
Unemployment is already high,

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:52.360
and there is always a fear 
that innovation will destroy jobs.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.491
And innovation is disruptive.

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.944
But let me stress two things here.

00:08:56.944 --> 00:08:58.875
First, we've already lived through

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.638
mechanization of agriculture,
automation of industry,

00:09:01.638 --> 00:09:03.663
and employment has gone up,

00:09:03.663 --> 00:09:05.956
because innovation is fundamentally about growth.

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.849
It makes products more affordable.

00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:10.509
It creates new demand, new jobs.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:13.091
Second, there is a concern that in the future,

00:09:13.091 --> 00:09:15.247
there will only be room for engineers,

00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:18.267
data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:21.836
And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:23.555
But think about it:

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:26.174
Just as a child can easily figure out

00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:27.930
how to operate an iPad,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.055
so a new generation of mobile and intuitive

00:09:30.055 --> 00:09:32.779
industrial applications will make life easier

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:35.198
for workers of all skill levels.

00:09:35.198 --> 00:09:38.400
The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.526
than the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times."

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:44.570
And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.446
mechanical digital engineers who understand

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:48.578
both the machines and the data;

00:09:48.578 --> 00:09:50.861
managers who understand their industry

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:53.722
and the analytics and can reorganize the business

00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:56.844
to take full advantage of the technology.

00:09:56.844 --> 00:09:59.160
But now let's take a step back.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.204
Let's look at the big picture.

00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:03.627
There are people who argue that today's innovation

00:10:03.627 --> 00:10:05.976
is all about social media and silly games,

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:07.866
with nowhere near the transformational power

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:09.945
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:12.700
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.126
are behind us.

00:10:14.126 --> 00:10:17.440
And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.408
even back in the Stone Age,

00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:21.697
there must have been a group of cavemen

00:10:21.697 --> 00:10:23.576
sitting around a fire one day

00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:25.102
looking very grumpy,

00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:27.828
and looking disapprovingly
at another group of cavemen

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:29.997
rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.806
and saying to each other,

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:34.087
"Yeah, this wheel thing,

00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:36.878
cool toy, sure, but compared to fire,

00:10:36.878 --> 00:10:38.994
it will have no impact.

00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:41.318
The big discoveries are all behind us."

00:10:41.318 --> 00:10:43.205
(Laughter)

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:44.753
This technological revolution

00:10:44.753 --> 00:10:47.281
is as inspiring and transformational

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.294
as anything we have ever seen.

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:52.684
Human creativity and innovation
have always propelled us forward.

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:54.131
They've created jobs.

00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:55.520
They've raised living standards.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.323
They've made our lives

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.383
healthier and more rewarding.

00:10:59.383 --> 00:11:00.626
And the new wave of innovation

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:02.976
which is beginning to sweep through industry

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:04.598
is no different.

00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:06.614
In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet

00:11:06.614 --> 00:11:10.554
could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:12.246
over the next 15 years,

00:11:12.246 --> 00:11:14.915
boosting growth to rates we
haven't seen in a long time,

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:18.859
and adding between 10 and 15
trillion dollars to global GDP.

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:23.112
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.

00:11:23.112 --> 00:11:25.623
But this is not a foregone conclusion.

00:11:25.623 --> 00:11:27.618
We are just at the beginning of this transformation,

00:11:27.618 --> 00:11:29.474
and there will be barriers to break,

00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:31.160
obstacles to overcome.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.701
We will need to invest in the new technologies.

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:37.410
We will need to adapt organizations
and managerial practices.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.304
We will need a robust cybersecurity approach

00:11:40.304 --> 00:11:44.047
that protects sensitive information
and intellectual property

00:11:44.047 --> 00:11:47.287
and safeguards critical infrastructure
from cyberattacks.

00:11:47.287 --> 00:11:49.524
And the education system will need to evolve

00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:52.732
to ensure students are equipped with the right skills.

00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:54.467
It's not going to be easy,

00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:57.114
but it is going to be worth it.

00:11:57.114 --> 00:12:00.662
The economic challenges facing us are hard,

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:02.758
but when I walk the factory floor,

00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:05.346
and I see how humans and brilliant machines

00:12:05.346 --> 00:12:07.064
are becoming interconnected,

00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:09.138
and I see the difference this makes

00:12:09.138 --> 00:12:11.704
in a hospital, in an airport,

00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:14.385
in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.993
I'm enthusiastic.

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:19.447
This new technological revolution is upon us.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.641
So think about the future â€”
it will be here soon enough.

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:25.326
Thank you.

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:29.419
(Applause)
