00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Last year here at TED

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I asked you to give me your data,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
to put your data on the web, on the basis

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
that if people put data onto the web --

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
government data, scientific data, community data,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
whatever it is -- it will be used by other people

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
to do wonderful things, in ways

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that they never could have imagined.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
So, today I'm back just to show you a few things,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
to show you, in fact, there is

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
an open data movement afoot,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
now, around the world.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
The cry of "Raw data now!"

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
which I made people make in the auditorium,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
was heard around the world.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
So, let's roll the video.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED --

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
it's about bicycle accidents."

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Two days it took the Times Online

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to make a map, a mashable map --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we call these things mash-ups --

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and have a look and find out whether your bicycle

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
route to work was affected.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Here's more data, traffic survey data,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
again, put out by the U.K. government,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
then a user could just make a map,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
just by clicking.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and which houses are there,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which houses have been connected to the water.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And he got, from other data sources,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
information to show

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
which houses are occupied by white people.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
between which houses were occupied by white people

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
That's the power of taking one piece of data,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
another piece of data, putting it together,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
and showing the result.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
Where Does My Money Go.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
You can burrow down by a particular type of spending,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Yes, certainly you can do it over here.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
in California.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
on different things such as energy.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
in the repositories of data.gov,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
and data.gov.uk.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And I'm delighted to see a great competition

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
How can you use this stuff?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
you can take, from a postcode --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
which is like a zip plus four --

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
for a specific group of houses, you can make paper,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
print off a paper which has got very, very

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
specific things about the bus stops,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the things specifically near you.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
On a larger scale, this is a mash-up

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
It allows you to set your own criteria

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
for what sort of things you want to look at.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
The red circles are polling stations,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
selected by your criteria.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And then you can select also other things on the map

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
to see what other factors, like the threat level.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
So, that was government data.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
"Terrace Theater" I actually put

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I was not the only person editing the open street map.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Each flash on this visualization --

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
put together by ITO World --

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
shows an edit in 2009

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
made to the Open Street Map.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Let's now spin the world during the same year.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Here focusing in on Haiti.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
The map of Port au-Prince at the end

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
of 2009 was not all it could be,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
not as good as the map of California.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Fortunately, just after the earthquake,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
GeoEye, a commercial company,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
released satellite imagery

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
with a license, which allowed

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
the open-source community to use it.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
This is January, in time lapse,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
of people editing ... that's the earthquake.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
After the earthquake, immediately,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
people all over the world, mappers

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
who wanted to help, and could,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.260
We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
showing where there are refugee camps --

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
rapidly became the best map

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
being used by rescue team in Haiti.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
There's the map showing,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
on the left-hand side,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
damaged buildings, refugee camps --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So, if you've been involved in that at all,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
or you've been putting government or scientific data online,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and we have only just started!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
(Applause)
