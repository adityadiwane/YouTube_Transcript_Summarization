00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.815
I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.053
We're going to use an unusual combination of tools

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.066
from game theory and neuroscience

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.033
to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:26.004
So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.990
used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.279
that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.410
and it predicts what people are likely to do

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.604
and believe others will do

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.994
in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:42.472
That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:45.763
games like hide-and-seek, and poker.

00:00:45.763 --> 00:00:48.002
Here's a simple game to get us started.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.164
Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100,

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:52.610
we're going to compute the average of those numbers,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.804
and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:59.073
So you want to be a little bit below the average number,

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:01.309
but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.254
a little bit below the average number as well.

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:05.833
Think about what you might pick.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:09.104
As you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:11.916
selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.141
You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.321
but you don't want to wait too late

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.722
to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:21.601
You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:25.214
Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:26.610
and then we'll see some data.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.801
Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:32.600
thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.710
A lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.383
so I think the average will be 50."

00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:39.294
They're not being really strategic at all.

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:42.646
"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33." That's a start.

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.538
Other people who are a little more sophisticated,

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.014
using more working memory,

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:49.918
say, "I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,

00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:52.886
and so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33."

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.365
They're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.982
That's better. And of course, in principle,

00:01:57.982 --> 00:01:59.809
you could do three, four or more,

00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:01.678
but it starts to get very difficult.

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.270
Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.904
very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:09.638
This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.

00:02:09.638 --> 00:02:12.194
It's something that I've worked on and a few other people,

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.414
and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:16.668
some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.552
and how the steps of thinking are affected

00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:22.248
by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.634
A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:29.174
due largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,

00:02:29.174 --> 00:02:31.414
is what's called equilibrium analysis.

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:33.868
So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,

00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:35.581
you will have learned a little bit about this.

00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.436
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.885
has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:42.892
It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,

00:02:42.892 --> 00:02:44.895
it may not exactly explain what people do

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.630
the first time they play these types of economic games

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.963
or in situations in the outside world.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:52.301
In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:55.161
which is everyone wants to be below everyone else,

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:57.452
therefore they'll play zero.

00:02:57.452 --> 00:03:00.461
Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.344
Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s

00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:04.989
by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.974
This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:10.854
to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:12.668
The contest said, send in your numbers

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:15.823
and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:18.911
And as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.292
There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.789
There is another spike visible at 22.

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.081
And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.591
They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.647
There's something a little bit noisy around it.

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:33.125
But you can see those spikes, and they're there.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:34.835
There's another group of people who seem to have

00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:36.910
a firm grip on equilibrium analysis,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.305
because they're picking zero or one.

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:41.394
But they lose, right?

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:44.586
Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:47.406
if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:49.518
So they're smart, but poor.

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:51.606
(Laughter)

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.575
Where are these things happening in the brain?

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:57.450
One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.958
So they had people play this game

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.175
while they were being scanned in an fMRI,

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.446
and two conditions: in some trials,

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:04.961
they're told you're playing another person

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.549
who's playing right now and we're going to match up

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.753
your behavior at the end and pay you if you win.

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.731
In the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:12.365
They're just choosing randomly.

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:14.442
So what you see here is a subtraction

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:17.192
of areas in which there's more brain activity

00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:20.168
when you're playing people compared to playing the computer.

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:22.159
And you see activity in some regions we've seen today,

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.396
medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:27.247
ventromedial prefrontal cortex,

00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:28.601
anterior cingulate, an area that's involved

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.238
in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,"

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:36.052
and also the right and left temporoparietal junction.

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:38.518
And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known

00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:40.839
to be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.740
or "mentalizing circuit."

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.118
That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.358
So these were some of the first studies to see this

00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:50.391
tied in to game theory.

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:52.631
What happens with these one- and two-step types?

00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:54.702
So we classify people by what they picked,

00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:56.369
and then we look at the difference between

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:58.344
playing humans versus playing computers,

00:04:58.344 --> 00:05:00.235
which brain areas are differentially active.

00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:01.987
On the top you see the one-step players.

00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:03.507
There's almost no difference.

00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:06.447
The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.

00:05:06.447 --> 00:05:10.588
The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:12.639
So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.735
Now if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:17.556
you might be able to look at brain activity and say,

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:19.055
"This person's going to be a good poker player,"

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:20.984
or, "This person's socially naive,"

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:22.262
and we might also be able to study things

00:05:22.262 --> 00:05:23.860
like development of adolescent brains

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.214
once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:29.826
Okay. Get ready.

00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:31.949
I'm saving you some brain activity,

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.759
because you don't need to use your hair detector cells.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.647
You should use those cells to think carefully about this game.

00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.582
This is a bargaining game.

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:42.138
Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes

00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:45.015
are going to bargain over one to six dollars.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:47.679
If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.719
If 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.402
That's kind of a mistake together.

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:55.219
The twist is that one player, on the left,

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.907
is informed about how much on each trial there is.

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.139
They play lots of trials with different amounts each time.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.380
In this case, they know there's four dollars.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.257
The uninformed player doesn't know,

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:06.311
but they know that the informed player knows.

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:08.370
So the uninformed player's challenge is to say,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.840
"Is this guy really being fair

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.694
or are they giving me a very low offer

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:14.772
in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?"

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:17.926
in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.876
So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:23.449
but trying to goad the other player into giving you more.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.779
And the way they bargain is to point on a number line

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.585
that goes from zero to six dollars,

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:30.563
and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:32.148
and the informed player's going to get the rest.

00:06:32.148 --> 00:06:34.723
So this is like a management-labor negotiation

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:37.456
in which the workers don't know how much profits

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.123
the privately held company has, right,

00:06:40.123 --> 00:06:42.491
and they want to maybe hold out for more money,

00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:44.327
but the company might want to create the impression

00:06:44.327 --> 00:06:47.259
that there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.490
First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.326
We have some other data where they play across computers.

00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:55.064
That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.

00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:57.266
But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs

00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:00.959
agree to divide the money evenly every single time.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.865
Boring. It's just not interesting neurally.

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:06.379
It's good for them. They make a lot of money.

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.051
But we're interested in, can we say something about

00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.587
when disagreements occur versus don't occur?

00:07:11.587 --> 00:07:13.944
So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:16.712
So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree

00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:18.019
and end up with less money.

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:21.936
They might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show.

00:07:21.936 --> 00:07:23.872
You see on the left,

00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:26.536
when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,

00:07:26.536 --> 00:07:28.184
they disagree about half the time,

00:07:28.184 --> 00:07:30.376
and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.

00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:32.250
This turns out to be something that's predicted

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.454
by a very complicated type of game theory

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.263
you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.

00:07:37.263 --> 00:07:39.435
It's a little too complicated to explain right now,

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.851
but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:45.067
Your intuition might tell you that too.

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:47.307
Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.

00:07:47.307 --> 00:07:49.660
Very complicated. The right brain schematic

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.523
is the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.323
Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time,

00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:57.715
so we can ask about time-synced activity

00:07:57.715 --> 00:08:00.939
in similar or different areas simultaneously,

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.203
just like if you wanted to study a conversation

00:08:03.203 --> 00:08:05.139
and you were scanning two people talking to each other

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.499
and you'd expect common activity in language regions

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:09.884
when they're actually kind of listening and communicating.

00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:13.811
So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,

00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:15.851
and the direction of the arrows flows

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.331
from the region that's active first in time,

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.899
and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.115
So in this case, if you look carefully,

00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:25.972
most of the arrows flow from right to left.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:29.252
That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.211
is happening first,

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:34.726
and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.

00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:38.418
And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.198
This is from the first two seconds.

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:42.178
We haven't finished analyzing this data,

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:44.078
so we're still peeking in, but the hope is

00:08:44.078 --> 00:08:46.642
that we can say something in the first couple of seconds

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:48.365
about whether they'll make a deal or not,

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.408
which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation

00:08:50.408 --> 00:08:52.336
and ugly divorces and things like that.

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:55.219
Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost

00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:58.195
by delay and strikes.

00:08:58.195 --> 00:09:00.225
Here's the case where the disagreements occur.

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:02.398
You can see it looks different than the one before.

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:04.647
There's a lot more arrows.

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:06.158
That means that the brains are synced up

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.710
more closely in terms of simultaneous activity,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.720
and the arrows flow clearly from left to right.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.962
That is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,

00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:15.250
"We're probably not going to make a deal here."

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.475
And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.978
Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.

00:09:20.978 --> 00:09:23.239
They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:26.429
You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.

00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:29.122
Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.

00:09:29.122 --> 00:09:32.583
Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:34.842
from chimpanzees about five million years ago.

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:36.810
They're still our closest genetic kin.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.547
We share 98.8 percent of the genes.

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:41.347
We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.064
And we're also their closest cousin.

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:46.066
They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:48.594
So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently

00:09:48.594 --> 00:09:51.049
might tell us a lot about brain evolution.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.650
So this is an amazing memory test

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.466
from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:58.244
where they've done a lot of this research.

00:09:58.244 --> 00:10:00.584
This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.

00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:02.356
The chimp is going to see, watch carefully,

00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:04.558
they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure

00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:06.552
— that's fast, that's eight movie frames —

00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:08.503
of numbers one, two, three, four, five.

00:10:08.503 --> 00:10:10.501
Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares,

00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.256
and they have to press the squares

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:14.577
that correspond to the numbers from low to high

00:10:14.577 --> 00:10:15.916
to get an apple reward.

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:20.687
Let's see how they can do it.

00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:29.884
This is a young chimp. The young ones

00:10:29.884 --> 00:10:32.667
are better than the old ones, just like humans.

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.259
And they're highly experienced, so they've done this

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.691
thousands and thousands of time.

00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:38.575
Obviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.

00:10:39.928 --> 00:10:41.272
(Laughter)

00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:43.207
You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.

00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:47.135
Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.

00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:50.570
Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.166
Wrong. (Laughter)

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:54.604
We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.

00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:57.194
Okay, so the next part of this study

00:10:57.194 --> 00:10:58.790
I'm going to go quickly through

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.482
is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.

00:11:01.482 --> 00:11:04.511
He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.

00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:05.803
We know chimps are faster and stronger.

00:11:05.803 --> 00:11:07.483
They're also very obsessed with status.

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:10.439
His thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:12.607
and they practice them in development

00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:14.458
that are really, really important to them

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.668
to negotiate status and to win,

00:11:16.668 --> 00:11:19.666
which is something like strategic thinking during competition.

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.246
So we're going to check that out

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:23.676
by having the chimps actually play a game

00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:26.314
by touching two touch screens.

00:11:26.314 --> 00:11:28.754
The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.362
They're going to press left or right.

00:11:30.362 --> 00:11:32.475
One chimp is called a matcher.

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:34.458
They win if they press left, left,

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:37.627
like a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:38.855
The mismatcher wants to mismatch.

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:41.931
They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.475
And the rewards are apple cube rewards.

00:11:44.475 --> 00:11:47.003
So here's how game theorists look at these data.

00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:48.617
This is a graph of the percentage of times

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:51.235
the matcher picked right on the x-axis,

00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:52.751
and the percentage of times they predicted right

00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:55.619
by the mismatcher on the y-axis.

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:58.819
So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:01.035
one trying to match, one trying to mismatch.

00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:04.315
The NE square in the middle -- actually NE, CH and QRE --

00:12:04.315 --> 00:12:06.771
those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,

00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:09.195
tells you what the theory predicts,

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:11.467
which is that they should match 50-50,

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:13.635
because if you play left too much, for example,

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:16.351
I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.

00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:19.115
And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,

00:12:19.115 --> 00:12:22.962
are circled around, hovering around that prediction.

00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:24.736
Now we move the payoffs.

00:12:24.736 --> 00:12:28.179
We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.699
Now they get three apple cubes.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.499
Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,

00:12:32.499 --> 00:12:34.089
because what happens is, the mismatcher will think,

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.899
oh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.964
and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:40.629
And as you can see, their behavior moves up

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:44.077
in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.

00:12:44.077 --> 00:12:46.391
Finally, we changed the payoffs one more time.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.583
Now it's four apple cubes,

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.755
and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.

00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:51.790
It's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.980
they're really, really close, within .01.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.179
They're actually closer than any species we've observed.

00:12:57.179 --> 00:13:00.372
What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:03.939
Here's two human groups in green and blue.

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:07.683
They're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,

00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:09.133
and also if you study their learning in the game,

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:11.118
they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.

00:13:11.118 --> 00:13:12.482
The chimps are playing better than the humans,

00:13:12.482 --> 00:13:14.905
better in the sense of adhering to game theory.

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:16.324
And these are two different groups of humans

00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:19.520
from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.755
None of them are close to where the chimps are.

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:24.510
So here are some things we learned today.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.448
People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking

00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:28.259
using theory of mind.

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.176
We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.668
that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.894
whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,

00:13:34.894 --> 00:13:36.734
and chimps are better competitors than humans,

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:39.198
as judged by game theory.

00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:41.055
Thank you.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:44.628
(Applause)
