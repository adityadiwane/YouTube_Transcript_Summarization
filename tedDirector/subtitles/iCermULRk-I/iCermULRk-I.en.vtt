00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
(Laughter)

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.330
It was great.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.330
So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
I'll talk for like two hours.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.330
I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
It's been an incredible few days.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.330
But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
that you just see flitting around the whole place

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.330
that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
It's really amazing.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
I've been in the audience.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.330
and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
(Laughter)

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Like, what have I got to say about all this?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
and I thought it was really great, and I was watching

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.330
those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.330
"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.330
But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
I guess there goes my green card.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
(Laughter)

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.330
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
we're talking about news stories about Africa;

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
we're not really talking about African narratives.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.330
And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.330
40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
or have the most inadequate health insurance,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
and have a president who, despite the protest

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
continues to prosecute a senseless war.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
So if news is anything to go by,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Which it isn't really, is it?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.330
that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.330
The truth is, everything we know about America,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
everything Americans come to know about being American,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
isn't from the news.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
I live there.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
We don't go home at the end of the day and think,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.330
"Well, I really know who I am now

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
closed at this many points."

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
It comes from popular culture.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
In other words, it's the agents of our imagination

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.330
who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
because in Africa

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
the complicated questions we want to ask about

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
what all of this means has been asked

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
from the rock paintings of the San people,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.330
through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.330
and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.330
"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
That's very important.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.330
There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.330
He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
they were thought to be business records.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
But what if they were poems and psalms?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.330
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.330
standing still in the morning light.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Giraffes are this desire in the dark."

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.330
This is important.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
It's important because misreading is really the chance

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
for complication and opportunity.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.330
The first Igbo Bible was translated from English

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.330
who was a Yoruba.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.330
and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
and one means "bicycle" or "iron."

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
was translated as --

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.330
[Igbo].

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
they chose the Igbo version.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
And I'm not going to give you the patois translation;

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.330
I'm going to make it standard English.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.330
Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.330
This is good, because language complicates things.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
You know, we often think that language mirrors

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
the world in which we live, and I find that's not true.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.330
The language actually makes the world in which we live.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
And language can't be understood in its abstraction.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330
It can only be understood in the context of story,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.330
and everything, all of this is story.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And it's important to remember that,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
But these are not new to Africa.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.330
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.330
The first time the possibility for independence was discussed

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.330
was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.330
In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
So, you know, the thing is to remember that

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
because otherwise, 10 years from now,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.330
So, what it says to me then is that it's not really --

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
the problem isn't really the stories that are being told

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
or which stories are being told,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
the problem really is the terms of humanity

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
that we're willing to bring to complicate every story,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
and that's really what it's all about.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
Well, it's just a joke, anyway.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.330
So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
my wife has been packing rice for lunch.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.330
off this building and kill myself."

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
And Dick and Harry repeat this.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
so he throws himself off and kills himself,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.330
and Dick's wife are distraught.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
They wished they'd not packed rice.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
(Laughter)

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.330
This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
with the Hausa being Harry.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.330
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.330
becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.330
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
In fact, every time I read in Ireland,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
people get me all mistaken and they say,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.330
But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330
in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
It makes sense now when I think about it,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.330
because if you'd known my father,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.330
you would've wanted to poison him too.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.330
(Laughter)

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.330
So I was born in 1966, at the beginning

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.330
of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
And I was growing up in school and the federal government

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.330
didn't want us taught about the history of the war,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
because they thought it probably would make us

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
generate a new generation of rebels.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.330
So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
who wanted to teach us about this.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.330
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.330
and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
I learned the melancholic history of my people

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
through the melancholic history of another people.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
I mean, picture this -- really picture this.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.330
A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.330
to young Igbo children.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
Story is powerful.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
And it should come as no surprise

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.330
It makes perfect sense.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.330
And they were to blow up strategic targets

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and take over the country, and they were foiled

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.330
by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and a Jewish Nazi hunter.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And it happened over four continents.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.330
to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.330
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.330
of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.330
So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.330
I grew up very privileged, and it's important

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
A lot of us are very privileged.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.330
I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.330
I was completely terrified, completely broken,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.330
and kept trying to find a new language,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
a new way to make sense of all of this.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
Six months after that, with no explanation,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.330
they let me go.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:41.330
(Laughter)

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
and not just me -- millions of Nigerians

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
grew up with books and libraries.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
In fact, we were talking last night about how all

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.330
of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.330
had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.330
than any sex education programs ever had.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
All of those are gone.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
We are squandering the most valuable resource

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
we have on this continent: the valuable resource

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
of the imagination.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.330
and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
played by Fraser James.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.330
And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
and he's crying.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.330
He's sniveling.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.330
It's a pitiful sight.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
And as we watch it, we are ashamed.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.330
And we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
Shut him up."

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
Please stop!"

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
Idris pauses, then he moves again,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
and Fraser says, "Please!

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
Please stop!"

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.330
And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.330
it's the look in Fraser's eyes.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.330
It's one that says, "Don't do this.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
And I'm not saying this to save myself,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330
because if you do this, you will be lost."

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
To be so afraid that you're standing in the face

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
and crying, but to say in that moment,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.330
as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
In that moment, Fraser says,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.330
"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
This is a redemption we can all aspire to.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.330
African narratives in the West, they proliferate.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.330
I really don't care anymore.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.330
how as a writer, I find that African writers

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:05.330
The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.330
with narratives of wounds and self-loathing?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330
And this is the difficulty that I face.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
to a place of ethical questioning.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
I am asking us to balance the idea

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.330
of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.330
of transformation of what is possible.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.330
As a young middle-class Nigerian activist,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.330
I launched myself along with a whole generation of us

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.330
into the campaign to stop the government.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
And I asked millions of people,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.330
without questioning my right to do so,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
to go up against the government.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.330
I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.330
Have I not myself been imprisoned?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
Have I not myself been beaten?"

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.330
It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
that I understood the real meaning of torture,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
for the time I was engaged in war,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
righteous, righteous war.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
Excuse me.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Sometimes I can stand before the world --

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
and when I say this, transformation

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
is a difficult and slow process --

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.330
sometimes I can stand before the world and say,

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.330
"My name is Chris Abani.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.330
I have been human six days, but only sometimes."

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
But this is a good thing.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
It's never going to be easy.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
There are no answers.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
that I had challenged my students in America --

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.330
So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.330
There are no essential Africans,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.330
about the continent we come from,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.330
and yet we want to make profound statements about it.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.330
to approximate the truth of our own communities,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.330
it will make for a much more nuanced

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
and a much more interesting conversation.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.330
I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
that we can rise above all of this.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.330
When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
and that book broke me.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.330
for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
"Here," Jimmy said.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
"Here is love, all of it."

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
The fact that it happens in "Another Country"

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.330
takes you quite by surprise.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
those who can count, and those who can't.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.330
(Laughter)

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.330
He also says that the cause of all our trouble

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
is the belief in an essential, pure identity:

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.330
religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.330
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.330
that speaks to transformation.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:10.330
"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.330
for how easy it is to be nailed to a board

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.330
weathered raw as white butcher paper.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.330
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.330
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
once shattered me into a song beneath her weight,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
before you slouched into that grassy hush.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.330
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.330
shaped like five bowstrings.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.330
Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.330
You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.330
Pressure can make everything whole again.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.330
Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.330
your face has been carved five times.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.330
I have to drive trouble in the hills.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.330
Trouble in the valley,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
and trouble by the river too.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.330
There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.330
Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
Ka-doooom.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Now I have beaten a song back into you.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Rise and walk away like a panther."

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
Thank you.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:38.330
(Applause)
