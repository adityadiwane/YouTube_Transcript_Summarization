00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:14.767
The day I left home for the first time

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.948
to go to university was a bright day

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:19.492
brimming with hope and optimism.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:22.439
I'd done well at school.
Expectations for me were high,

00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:24.614
and I gleefully entered the student life

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:28.213
of lectures, parties
and traffic cone theft.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.890
Now appearances, of course,
can be deceptive,

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.005
and to an extent, this
feisty, energetic persona

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:37.160
of lecture-going and traffic
cone stealing was a veneer,

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:40.199
albeit a very well-crafted
and convincing one.

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:43.625
Underneath, I was actually
deeply unhappy, insecure

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.839
and fundamentally frightened --

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:49.462
frightened of other people,
of the future, of failure

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.815
and of the emptiness
that I felt was within me.

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.316
But I was skilled at hiding
it, and from the outside

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.721
appeared to be someone
with everything to hope for

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:57.972
and aspire to.

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.178
This fantasy of invulnerability
was so complete

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:02.890
that I even deceived myself,

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:05.438
and as the first semester
ended and the second began,

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:07.970
there was no way that anyone
could have predicted

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:10.593
what was just about to happen.

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:13.726
I was leaving a seminar when it started,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.887
humming to myself, fumbling with my bag

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.310
just as I'd done a hundred times before,

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.786
when suddenly I heard
a voice calmly observe,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.978
"She is leaving the room."

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.393
I looked around, and there
was no one there,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.067
but the clarity
and decisiveness of the comment

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.911
was unmistakable.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.555
Shaken, I left my books
on the stairs and hurried home,

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.794
and there it was again.

00:01:32.818 --> 00:01:34.857
"She is opening the door."

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.829
This was the beginning.
The voice had arrived.

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:41.076
And the voice persisted,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.541
days and then weeks of it, on and on,

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.804
narrating everything I did
in the third person.

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:47.462
"She is going to the library."

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:49.057
"She is going to a lecture."

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:52.393
It was neutral, impassive
and even, after a while,

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.975
strangely companionate and reassuring,

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.416
although I did notice that its
calm exterior sometimes slipped

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.517
and that it occasionally mirrored
my own unexpressed emotion.

00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.129
So, for example, if I was angry
and had to hide it,

00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:07.495
which I often did, being very adept
at concealing how I really felt,

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.832
then the voice would sound frustrated.

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:12.645
Otherwise, it was neither
sinister nor disturbing,

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.755
although even at that point it was clear

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.779
that it had something to communicate to me

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.150
about my emotions, particularly emotions

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:22.235
which were remote and inaccessible.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.359
Now it was then that I made
a fatal mistake,

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:28.562
in that I told a friend
about the voice, and she was horrified.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.807
A subtle conditioning process had begun,

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:34.496
the implication that normal
people don't hear voices

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.854
and the fact that I did meant
that something was very seriously wrong.

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:41.242
Such fear and mistrust was infectious.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:44.307
Suddenly the voice didn't
seem quite so benign anymore,

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.808
and when she insisted
that I seek medical attention,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.879
I duly complied, and which proved to be

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:50.626
mistake number two.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.772
I spent some time telling the college G.P.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:54.987
about what I perceived
to be the real problem:

00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.843
anxiety, low self-worth,
fears about the future,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:02:59.616
and was met with bored indifference

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.410
until I mentioned the voice,

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.434
upon which he dropped his pen, swung round

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.145
and began to question me
with a show of real interest.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.789
And to be fair, I was desperate
for interest and help,

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.635
and I began to tell him
about my strange commentator.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.183
And I always wish, at this
point, the voice had said,

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:15.875
"She is digging her own grave."

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.400
I was referred
to a psychiatrist, who likewise

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.957
took a grim view of the voice's presence,

00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:24.029
subsequently interpreting
everything I said

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.365
through a lens of latent insanity.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.298
For example, I was part
of a student TV station

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:31.850
that broadcast news bulletins
around the campus,

00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:33.900
and during an appointment
which was running very late,

00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:35.149
I said, "I'm sorry,
doctor, I've got to go.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.667
I'm reading the news at six."

00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:38.977
Now it's down on my medical
records that Eleanor

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:42.151
has delusions that she's a television
news broadcaster.

00:03:42.175 --> 00:03:45.600
It was at this point that events began

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.830
to rapidly overtake me.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:50.226
A hospital admission
followed, the first of many,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.138
a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:56.746
and then, worst of all,
a toxic, tormenting sense

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.124
of hopelessness, humiliation and despair

00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:02.659
about myself and my prospects.

00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:05.092
But having been encouraged
to see the voice

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:07.648
not as an experience but as a symptom,

00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:10.744
my fear and resistance
towards it intensified.

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:12.828
Now essentially, this represented taking

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.880
an aggressive stance towards my own mind,

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.271
a kind of psychic civil war,

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:20.205
and in turn this caused
the number of voices to increase

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.590
and grow progressively
hostile and menacing.

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:27.070
Helplessly and hopelessly,
I began to retreat

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.209
into this nightmarish inner world

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:31.281
in which the voices
were destined to become

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:35.303
both my persecutors
and my only perceived companions.

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:38.382
They told me, for example,
that if I proved myself worthy

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:40.549
of their help, then
they could change my life

00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:41.746
back to how it had been,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.486
and a series of increasingly
bizarre tasks was set,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.511
a kind of labor of Hercules.

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:48.472
It started off quite small, for example,

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.188
pull out three strands of hair,

00:04:50.212 --> 00:04:51.879
but gradually it grew more extreme,

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.099
culminating in commands to harm myself,

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.269
and a particularly dramatic instruction:

00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:57.982
"You see that tutor over there?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.280
You see that glass of water?

00:04:59.304 --> 00:05:02.078
Well, you have to go over and pour it
over him in front of the other students."

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.341
Which I actually did,
and which needless to say

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:06.022
did not endear me to the faculty.

00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:10.326
In effect, a vicious cycle
of fear, avoidance,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.184
mistrust and misunderstanding
had been established,

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.936
and this was a battle
in which I felt powerless

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.313
and incapable of establishing
any kind of peace or reconciliation.

00:05:20.337 --> 00:05:23.971
Two years later,
and the deterioration was dramatic.

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:27.679
By now, I had the whole
frenzied repertoire:

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:30.668
terrifying voices, grotesque visions,

00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:33.436
bizarre, intractable delusions.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.632
My mental health status
had been a catalyst

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:38.221
for discrimination, verbal abuse,

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:40.376
and physical and sexual assault,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.162
and I'd been told by my psychiatrist,

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:44.571
"Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:48.324
because cancer is easier
to cure than schizophrenia."

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.716
I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.792
and was by now so tormented by the voices

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.997
that I attempted to drill
a hole in my head

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.853
in order to get them out.

00:05:58.877 --> 00:06:02.954
Now looking back on the wreckage
and despair of those years,

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:06.024
it seems to me now as if someone
died in that place,

00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:09.741
and yet, someone else was saved.

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:13.055
A broken and haunted
person began that journey,

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:15.988
but the person who emerged was a survivor

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:18.262
and would ultimately grow into the person

00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:20.386
I was destined to be.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.074
Many people have harmed me in my life,

00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:24.568
and I remember them all,

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.369
but the memories grow pale and faint

00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:31.061
in comparison with the people
who've helped me.

00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:33.681
The fellow survivors,
the fellow voice-hearers,

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:35.953
the comrades and collaborators;

00:06:35.977 --> 00:06:38.281
the mother who never gave up on me,

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:40.889
who knew that one day
I would come back to her

00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:44.559
and was willing to wait for me
for as long as it took;

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.096
the doctor who only worked
with me for a brief time

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.168
but who reinforced
his belief that recovery

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.482
was not only possible but inevitable,

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:53.885
and during a devastating period of relapse

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.785
told my terrified family,
"Don't give up hope.

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:59.798
I believe that Eleanor
can get through this.

00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:02.636
Sometimes, you know, it
snows as late as May,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.062
but summer always comes eventually."

00:07:06.086 --> 00:07:07.916
Fourteen minutes is not enough time

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.852
to fully credit those
good and generous people

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:12.829
who fought with me and for me

00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:14.628
and who waited to welcome me back

00:07:14.652 --> 00:07:17.127
from that agonized, lonely place.

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.294
But together, they forged
a blend of courage,

00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:22.880
creativity, integrity,
and an unshakeable belief

00:07:22.904 --> 00:07:26.729
that my shattered self could
become healed and whole.

00:07:26.753 --> 00:07:28.706
I used to say that these people saved me,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.076
but what I now know is they did something

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.647
even more important
in that they empowered me

00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:34.269
to save myself,

00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:36.817
and crucially, they helped
me to understand something

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:38.397
which I'd always suspected:

00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:40.785
that my voices were a meaningful response

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:43.735
to traumatic life events,
particularly childhood events,

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.584
and as such were not my enemies

00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:50.336
but a source of insight
into solvable emotional problems.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.406
Now, at first, this was very
difficult to believe,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.780
not least because the voices
appeared so hostile

00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:59.126
and menacing, so in this
respect, a vital first step

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.841
was learning to separate
out a metaphorical meaning

00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:05.619
from what I'd previously
interpreted to be a literal truth.

00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:08.769
So for example, voices
which threatened to attack my home

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:11.498
I learned to interpret
as my own sense of fear

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:15.156
and insecurity in the world, rather
than an actual, objective danger.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.312
Now at first, I would have believed them.

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:18.884
I remember, for example,
sitting up one night

00:08:18.908 --> 00:08:21.354
on guard outside my parents'
room to protect them

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:24.598
from what I thought was a genuine
threat from the voices.

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:27.112
Because I'd had such a bad
problem with self-injury

00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:29.708
that most of the cutlery
in the house had been hidden,

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:32.202
so I ended up arming myself
with a plastic fork,

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:34.988
kind of like picnic ware,
and sort of sat outside the room

00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:38.702
clutching it and waiting to spring
into action should anything happen.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.374
It was like, "Don't mess with me.

00:08:40.398 --> 00:08:43.107
I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"

00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.587
Strategic.

00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:47.193
But a later response,
and much more useful,

00:08:47.217 --> 00:08:51.611
would be to try and deconstruct
the message behind the words,

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:54.633
so when the voices warned
me not to leave the house,

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:56.709
then I would thank them
for drawing my attention

00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:57.926
to how unsafe I felt --

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.819
because if I was aware of it, then I could
do something positive about it --

00:09:00.843 --> 00:09:03.306
but go on to reassure both them and myself

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.805
that we were safe and didn't
need to feel frightened anymore.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:08.294
I would set boundaries for the voices,

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:11.033
and try to interact with them
in a way that was assertive

00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:13.289
yet respectful,
establishing a slow process

00:09:13.313 --> 00:09:15.645
of communication and collaboration

00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:18.944
in which we could learn to work
together and support one another.

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:21.588
Throughout all of this,
what I would ultimately realize

00:09:21.612 --> 00:09:23.472
was that each voice was closely related

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.781
to aspects of myself,
and that each of them

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:28.091
carried overwhelming
emotions that I'd never had

00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:30.169
an opportunity to process or resolve,

00:09:30.193 --> 00:09:32.729
memories of sexual trauma and abuse,

00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:35.640
of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.

00:09:35.664 --> 00:09:38.140
The voices took the place of this pain

00:09:38.164 --> 00:09:39.627
and gave words to it,

00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:41.466
and possibly one of the greatest
revelations

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.490
was when I realized that the most hostile
and aggressive voices

00:09:44.514 --> 00:09:46.237
actually represented the parts of me

00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:48.450
that had been hurt most profoundly,

00:09:48.474 --> 00:09:50.602
and as such, it was these voices

00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:53.944
that needed to be shown
the greatest compassion and care.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.959
It was armed with this
knowledge that ultimately

00:09:56.983 --> 00:09:59.247
I would gather together my shattered self,

00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:01.862
each fragment represented
by a different voice,

00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:03.913
gradually withdraw from all my medication,

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:08.601
and return to psychiatry, only this
time from the other side.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:12.199
Ten years after the voice first
came, I finally graduated,

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:14.093
this time with the highest
degree in psychology

00:10:14.117 --> 00:10:16.551
the university had ever
given, and one year later,

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.433
the highest masters, which shall we say

00:10:18.457 --> 00:10:20.156
isn't bad for a madwoman.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.847
In fact, one of the voices
actually dictated the answers

00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:26.077
during the exam, which technically
possibly counts as cheating.

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:27.478
(Laughter)

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:30.212
And to be honest, sometimes I quite
enjoyed their attention as well.

00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:32.379
As Oscar Wilde has said,
the only thing worse

00:10:32.403 --> 00:10:34.896
than being talked about is not
being talked about.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.063
It also makes you very
good at eavesdropping,

00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:39.897
because you can listen
to two conversations simultaneously.

00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:41.186
So it's not all bad.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.877
I worked in mental health services,

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:45.098
I spoke at conferences,

00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:47.408
I published book chapters
and academic articles,

00:10:47.432 --> 00:10:50.198
and I argued, and continue to do so,

00:10:50.222 --> 00:10:52.442
the relevance of the following concept:

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:54.694
that an important question in psychiatry

00:10:54.718 --> 00:10:56.338
shouldn't be what's wrong with you

00:10:56.362 --> 00:10:58.942
but rather what's happened to you.

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:01.804
And all the while,
I listened to my voices,

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.686
with whom I'd finally learned
to live with peace and respect

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.804
and which in turn
reflected a growing sense

00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:10.467
of compassion, acceptance
and respect towards myself.

00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:13.625
And I remember the most moving
and extraordinary moment

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:16.935
when supporting another young woman
who was terrorized by her voices,

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.534
and becoming fully aware,
for the very first time,

00:11:19.558 --> 00:11:21.830
that I no longer felt that way myself

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:25.554
but was finally able to help
someone else who was.

00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:29.122
I'm now very proud to be
a part of Intervoice,

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:33.091
the organizational body of the International
Hearing Voices Movement,

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:36.474
an initiative inspired by the work
of Professor Marius Romme

00:11:36.498 --> 00:11:37.726
and Dr. Sandra Escher,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.922
which locates voice hearing
as a survival strategy,

00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:44.288
a sane reaction to insane circumstances,

00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:47.947
not as an aberrant symptom
of schizophrenia to be endured,

00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:51.211
but a complex, significant
and meaningful experience

00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:53.535
to be explored.

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.818
Together, we envisage and enact a society

00:11:55.842 --> 00:11:58.295
that understands
and respects voice hearing,

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:00.700
supports the needs
of individuals who hear voices,

00:12:00.724 --> 00:12:03.981
and which values them as full citizens.

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.267
This type of society is not only possible,

00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:08.279
it's already on its way.

00:12:08.303 --> 00:12:12.073
To paraphrase Chavez, once
social change begins,

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.165
it cannot be reversed.

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:17.392
You cannot humiliate
the person who feels pride.

00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:19.183
You cannot oppress the people

00:12:19.207 --> 00:12:21.667
who are not afraid anymore.

00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:24.311
For me, the achievements
of the Hearing Voices Movement

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:26.745
are a reminder that empathy, fellowship,

00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:29.489
justice and respect are more than words;

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:32.100
they are convictions and beliefs,

00:12:32.124 --> 00:12:34.586
and that beliefs can change the world.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.361
In the last 20 years,
the Hearing Voices Movement

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:39.573
has established hearing voices networks

00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:42.564
in 26 countries across five continents,

00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:45.933
working together to promote
dignity, solidarity

00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:48.999
and empowerment for individuals
in mental distress,

00:12:49.023 --> 00:12:52.264
to create a new language
and practice of hope,

00:12:52.288 --> 00:12:56.208
which, at its very center,
lies an unshakable belief

00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:59.098
in the power of the individual.

00:12:59.122 --> 00:13:02.019
As Peter Levine has said, the human animal

00:13:02.043 --> 00:13:03.671
is a unique being

00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:07.045
endowed with an instinctual
capacity to heal

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:11.256
and the intellectual spirit
to harness this innate capacity.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.740
In this respect, for members of society,

00:13:13.764 --> 00:13:16.233
there is no greater honor or privilege

00:13:16.257 --> 00:13:18.893
than facilitating that process
of healing for someone,

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:21.839
to bear witness, to reach out a hand,

00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:24.202
to share the burden
of someone's suffering,

00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:27.276
and to hold the hope for their recovery.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.872
And likewise, for survivors
of distress and adversity,

00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:32.384
that we remember we don't
have to live our lives

00:13:32.408 --> 00:13:36.096
forever defined by the damaging
things that have happened to us.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.605
We are unique. We are irreplaceable.

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:41.322
What lies within us can
never be truly colonized,

00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:43.678
contorted, or taken away.

00:13:43.702 --> 00:13:47.776
The light never goes out.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.886
As a very wonderful
doctor once said to me,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.137
"Don't tell me what other people
have told you about yourself.

00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:56.188
Tell me about you."

00:13:56.212 --> 00:13:57.994
Thank you.

00:13:58.018 --> 00:14:03.542
(Applause)
