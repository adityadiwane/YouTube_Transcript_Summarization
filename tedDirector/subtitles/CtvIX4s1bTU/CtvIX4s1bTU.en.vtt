00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.336
So there are lands
few and far between on Earth itself

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.680
that are hospitable to humans
by any measure,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.120
but survive we have.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.056
Our primitive ancestors, when they found
their homes and livelihood endangered,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.216
they dared to make their way
into unfamiliar territories

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.080
in search of better opportunities.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.976
And as the descendants of these explorers,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.280
we have their nomadic blood
coursing through our own veins.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.496
But at the same time,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.616
distracted by our bread and circuses

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.000
and embroiled in the wars
that we have waged on each other,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.000
it seems that we have forgotten
this desire to explore.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.160
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.960
for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.816
and so content are we
with our living conditions

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.256
that we have grown complacent
and just too busy

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.200
to notice that its resources are finite,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.280
and that our Sun's life is also finite.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.176
While Mars and all the movies
made in its name

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.216
have reinvigorated
the ethos for space travel,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.616
few of us seem to truly realize
that our species' fragile constitution

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.040
is woefully unprepared
for long duration journeys into space.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.416
Let us take a trek
to your local national forest

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.256
for a quick reality check.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.976
So just a quick show of hands here:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.576
how many of you think you would be able
to survive in this lush wilderness

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.800
for a few days?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.296
Well, that's a lot of you.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.520
How about a few weeks?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.256
That's a decent amount.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.480
How about a few months?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.096
That's pretty good too.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.776
Now, let us imagine
that this local national forest

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.760
experiences an eternal winter.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.240
Same questions: how many of you think you
would be able to survive for a few days?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.696
That's quite a lot.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.920
How about a few weeks?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.096
So for a fun twist, let us imagine
that the only source of water available

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.520
is trapped as frozen blocks
miles below the surface.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.176
Soil nutrients are so minimal
that no vegetation can be found,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.400
and of course hardly any atmosphere
exists to speak of.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.376
Such examples are only a few
of the many challenges we would face

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.240
on a planet like Mars.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.176
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages
whose destinations are so far removed

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.680
from a tropical vacation?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.160
Will we continuously ship supplies
from Planet Earth?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.336
Build space elevators,
or impossible miles of transport belts

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000
that tether your planet of choice
to our home planet?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.880
And how do we grow things like food
that grew up on Earth like us?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.640
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.960
In our species' journey
to find a new home under a new sun,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.576
we are more likely than not
going to be spending much time

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.160
in the journey itself,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.456
in space,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.160
on a ship, a hermetic flying can,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.840
possibly for many generations.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.896
The longest continuous amount of time
that any human has spent in space

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.800
is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.936
From astronauts' experiences in space,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.736
we know that spending time
in a microgravity environment

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.336
means bone loss, muscle atrophy,
cardiovascular problems,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.936
among many other complications

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.280
that range for the physiological
to the psychological.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.616
And what about macrogravity,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.136
or any other variation
in gravitational pull

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.080
of the planet that we find ourselves on?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.096
In short, our cosmic voyages
will be fraught with dangers

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.720
both known and unknown.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.976
So far we've been looking to this
new piece of mechanical technology

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.256
or that great next generation robot

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.720
as part of a lineup to ensure
our species safe passage in space.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.536
Wonderful as they are,
I believe the time has come

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.816
for us to complement
these bulky electronic giants

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.680
with what nature has already invented:

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.696
the microbe,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.936
a single-celled organism that is itself
a self-generating, self-replenishing,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.160
living machine.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.176
It requires fairly little to maintain,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.096
offers much flexibility in design

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.440
and only asks to be carried
in a single plastic tube.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:37.256
The field of study that has enabled us
to utilize the capabilities of the microbe

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.880
is known as synthetic biology.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.536
It comes from molecular biology,
which has given us antibiotics, vaccines

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.856
and better ways to observe
the physiological nuances

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.080
of the human body.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.496
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.456
we can now edit the genes
of nearly any organism,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.416
microscopic or not,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.840
with incredible speed and fidelity.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.656
Given the limitations
of our man-made machines,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.656
synthetic biology will be a means for us
to engineer not only our food,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.416
our fuel and our environment,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.736
but also ourselves

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.376
to compensate
for our physical inadequacies

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.560
and to ensure our survival in space.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.216
To give you an example

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.056
of how we can use synthetic biology
for space exploration,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.000
let us return to the Mars environment.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.896
The Martian soil composition is similar
to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.800
with trace amounts of organic material.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.656
Let's say, hypothetically,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.416
what if martian soil
could actually support plant growth

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.280
without using Earth-derived nutrients?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.456
The first question
we should probably ask is,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.856
how would we make
our plants cold-tolerant?

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.976
Because, on average,
the temperature on Mars

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.760
is a very uninviting
negative 60 degrees centigrade.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.776
The next question we should ask is,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.256
how do we make
our plants drought-tolerant?

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.096
Considering that most of the water
that forms as frost

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.960
evaporates more quickly
than I can say the word "evaporate."

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.720
Well, it turns out
we've already done things like this.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.776
By borrowing genes
for anti-freeze protein from fish

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.976
and genes for drought tolerance
from other plants like rice

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.696
and then stitching them
into the plants that need them,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.680
we now have plants that can tolerate
most droughts and freezes.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.096
They're known on Earth as GMOs,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.920
or genetically modified organisms,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.040
and we rely on them to feed
all the mouths of human civilization.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.576
Nature does stuff like this already,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.136
without our help.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.240
We have simply found
more precise ways to do it.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.960
So why would we want to change
the genetic makeup of plants for space?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.696
Well, to not do so
would mean needing to engineer

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.136
endless acres of land
on an entirely new planet

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.656
by releasing trillions of gallons
of atmospheric gasses

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.720
and then constructing
a giant glass dome to contain it all.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.536
It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.080
that quickly becomes
a high-cost cargo transport mission.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.696
One of the best ways to ensure

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.816
that we will have the food supplies
and the air that we need

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.936
is to bring with us organisms
that have been engineered

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.520
to adapt to new and harsh environments.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.736
In essence, using engineered organisms
to help us terraform a planet

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.800
both in the short and long term.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.400
These organisms can then also
be engineered to make medicine or fuel.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.656
So we can use synthetic biology
to bring highly engineered plants with us,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.920
but what else can we do?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.736
Well, I mentioned earlier
that we, as a species,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.080
were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.416
That fact has not changed much
in the last five minutes

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.880
that you were sitting here
and I was standing there.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.176
And so, if we were to dump
any of us on Mars right this minute,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.696
even given ample food, water, air

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.936
and a suit,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.336
we are likely to experience
very unpleasant health problems

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.656
from the amount of ionizing radiation
that bombards the surface

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.520
of planets like Mars that have little
or nonexistent atmosphere.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.296
Unless we plan
to stay holed up underground

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.960
for the duration of our stay
on every new planet,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.056
we must find better ways
of protecting ourselves

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.736
without needing to resort
to wearing a suit of armor

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.216
that weighs something
equal to your own body weight,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.520
or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.840
So let us appeal
to nature for inspiration.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.296
Among the plethora of life here on Earth,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.176
there's a subset of organisms
known as extremophiles,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.176
or lovers of extreme living conditions,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.656
if you'll remember
from high school biology.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.160
And among these organisms is a bacterium
by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.416
It is known to be able to withstand cold,
dehydration, vacuum, acid,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.640
and, most notably, radiation.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.135
While its radiation
tolerance mechanisms are known,

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.559
we have yet to adapt
the relevant genes to mammals.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.136
To do so is not particularly easy.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.976
There are many facets
that go into its radiation tolerance,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.240
and it's not as simple
as transferring one gene.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.216
But given a little bit of human ingenuity

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.496
and a little bit of time,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.960
I think to do so is not very hard either.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.760
Even if we borrow just a fraction
of its ability to tolerate radiation,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.416
it would be infinitely better
than what we already have,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.400
which is just the melanin in our skin.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.576
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.616
we can harness Deinococcus
radiodurans' ability

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.360
to thrive under otherwise
very lethal doses of radiation.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.240
As difficult as it is to see,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.240
homo sapiens, that is humans,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.496
evolves every day,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.440
and still continues to evolve.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.136
Thousands of years of human evolution

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.136
has not only given us
humans like Tibetans,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.736
who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.696
but also Argentinians,
who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.520
the chemical element
that can kill the average human being.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.056
Every day, the human body evolves
by accidental mutations

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.936
that equally accidentally
allow certain humans

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.200
to persevere in dismal situations.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.040
But, and this is a big but,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.656
such evolution requires two things
that we may not always have,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.120
or be able to afford,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.360
and they are death and time.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.576
In our species' struggle
to find our place in the universe,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.056
we may not always have the time necessary

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.616
for the natural evolution
of extra functions

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.640
for survival on non-Earth planets.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.856
We're living in what E.O. Wilson
has termed the age of gene circumvention,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.256
during which we remedy our genetic defects
like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.880
with temporary external supplements.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.496
But with every passing day,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.696
we approach the age
of volitional evolution,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.696
a time during which we as a species

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.600
will have the capacity to decide
for ourselves our own genetic destiny.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.056
Augmenting the human body
with new abilities

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.160
is no longer a question of how,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.120
but of when.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.496
Using synthetic biology

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.616
to change the genetic makeup
of any living organisms,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.856
especially our own,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.200
is not without its moral
and ethical quandaries.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.800
Will engineering ourselves
make us less human?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.216
But then again, what is humanity

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.760
but star stuff
that happens to be conscious?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.640
Where should human genius direct itself?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.560
Surely it is a bit of a waste
to sit back and marvel at it.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.136
How do we use our knowledge

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.416
to protect ourselves
from the external dangers

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.080
and then protect ourselves from ourselves?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.816
I pose these questions

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.016
not to engender the fear of science

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.416
but to bring to light
the many possibilities

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.840
that science has afforded
and continues to afford us.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.736
We must coalesce as humans
to discuss and embrace the solutions

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.960
not only with caution

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.600
but also with courage.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.800
Mars is a destination,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.040
but it will not be our last.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.856
Our true final frontier
is the line we must cross

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.600
in deciding what we can and should make
of our species' improbable intelligence.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.120
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.536
Our path to the stars
will be rife with trials

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.536
that will bring us to question
not only who we are

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.320
but where we will be going.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.736
The answers will lie in our choice
to use or abandon the technology

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.856
that we have gleaned from life itself,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.736
and it will define us for the remainder
of our term in this universe.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.976
Thank you.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.619
(Applause)
