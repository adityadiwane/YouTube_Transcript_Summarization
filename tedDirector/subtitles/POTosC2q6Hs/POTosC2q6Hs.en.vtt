00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.479
As a software developer and technologist,

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:19.126
I've worked on a number
of civic technology projects

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:20.472
over the years.

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:24.118
Civic tech is sometimes
referred to as tech for good,

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.763
using technology to solve
humanitarian problems.

00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:29.876
This is in 2010 in Uganda,

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:32.616
working on a solution
that allowed local populations

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:36.099
to avoid government surveillance
on their mobile phones

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:38.328
for expressing dissent.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:41.216
That same technology was deployed
later in North Africa

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:44.998
for similar purposes
to help activists stay connected

00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:48.149
when governments were
deliberately shutting off connectivity

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.225
as a means of population control.

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.522
But over the years, as I have thought
about these technologies

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.523
and the things that I work on,

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.542
a question kind of nags
in the back of my mind, which is,

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.267
what if we're wrong about
the virtues of technology,

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.519
and if it sometimes actively hurts

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.677
the communities
that we're intending to help?

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:11.456
The tech industry around the world
tends to operate under similar assumptions

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.621
that if we build great things,

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:16.035
it will positively affect everyone.

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.904
Eventually, these innovations
will get out and find everyone.

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:22.003
But that's not always the case.

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:27.784
I like to call this blind championing
of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:30.129
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.045
We tend to think that if
we design things for the select few,

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.447
eventually those technologies
will reach everyone,

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.002
and that's not always the case.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:42.018
Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.897
They tend to consolidate
in the hands of the few,

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:48.287
and sometimes they find their way out
into the hands of the many.

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:53.488
And so most of you aren't tackling
oppressive regimes on the weekends,

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:57.714
so I wanted to think of a few examples
that might be a little bit more relatable.

00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:02.066
In the world of wearables
and smartphones and apps,

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.329
there's a big movement
to track people's personal health

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.377
with applications that track
the number of calories that you burn

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:13.220
or whether you're sitting too much
or walking enough.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.561
These technologies make patient intake
in medical facilities much more efficient,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.496
and in turn, these medical facilities

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:26.083
are starting to expect
these types of efficiencies.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.883
As these digital tools
find their way into medical rooms,

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:30.928
and they become digitally ready,

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:33.297
what happens to the digitally invisible?

00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:35.297
What does the medical experience look like

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.655
for someone who doesn't have
the $400 phone or watch

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:40.448
tracking their every movement?

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:43.281
Do they now become a burden
on the medical system?

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:46.079
Is their experience changed?

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.341
In the world of finance,
Bitcoin and crypto-currencies

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.261
are revolutionizing the way
we move money around the world,

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.658
but the challenge with these technologies

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:57.247
is the barrier to entry
is incredibly high, right?

00:02:57.247 --> 00:03:01.043
You need access to the same
phones, devices, connectivity,

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:04.178
and even where you don't,
where you can find a proxy agent,

00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:09.217
usually they require a certain amount
of capital to participate.

00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:14.000
And so the question that I ask myself
is, what happens to the last community

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.070
using paper notes when the rest
of the world moves to digital currency?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.055
Another example from my hometown
in Philadelphia:

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.220
I recently went
to the public library there,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.792
and they are facing an existential crisis.

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:29.465
Public funding is dwindling,

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:34.641
they have to reduce their footprint
to stay open and stay relevant,

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:37.477
and so one of the ways
they're going about this

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:40.770
is digitizing a number of the books
and moving them to the cloud.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.745
This is great for most kids. Right?

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.598
You can check out books from home,

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.147
you can research on the way
to school or from school,

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:49.339
but these are really two big assumptions,

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.336
that one, you have access at home,

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.936
and two, that you have access
to a mobile phone,

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.812
and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:59.671
So what does their
education experience look like

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:03.108
in the wake of a completely
cloud-based library,

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:06.567
what used to be considered
such a basic part of education?

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:08.556
How do they stay competitive?

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:13.466
A final example from
across the world in East Africa:

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:18.782
there's been a huge movement
to digitize land ownership rights,

00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:20.383
for a number of reasons.

00:04:20.383 --> 00:04:23.285
Migrant communities,
older generations dying off,

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:25.925
and ultimately poor record-keeping

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:29.392
have led to conflicts over who owns what.

00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:33.664
And so there was a big movement
to put all this information online,

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:37.424
to track all the ownership
of these plots of land,

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:40.119
put them in the cloud,
and give them to the communities.

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:43.161
But actually, the unintended
consequence of this

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:47.531
has been that venture capitalists,
investors, real estate developers,

00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:50.558
have swooped in and they've begun
buying up these plots of land

00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:52.564
right out from under these communities,

00:04:52.564 --> 00:04:54.700
because they have access
to the technologies

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.137
and the connectivity
that makes that possible.

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:01.287
So that's the common thread
that connects these examples,

00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:04.836
the unintended consequences of the tools
and the technologies that we make.

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:07.801
As engineers, as technologists,

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.360
we sometimes prefer
efficiency over efficacy.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.753
We think more about doing things
than the outcomes of what we are doing.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:17.220
This needs to change.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.251
We have a responsibility to think about
the outcomes of the technologies we build,

00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.734
especially as they increasingly
control the world in which we live.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:26.174
In the late '90s,

00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:30.283
there was a big push for ethics
in the world of investment and banking.

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:34.091
I think in 2014, we're long overdue
for a similar movement

00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:37.753
in the area of tech and technology.

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:42.535
So, I just encourage you, as you are all
thinking about the next big thing,

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:47.907
as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,
as engineers, as makers,

00:05:47.907 --> 00:05:51.784
that you think about
the unintended consequences

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.944
of the things that you're building,

00:05:53.944 --> 00:05:57.496
because the real innovation
is in finding ways to include everyone.

00:05:57.496 --> 00:05:59.168
Thank you.

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:03.278
(Applause)
