00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:15.275
I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.450
81's platoon,

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:18.479
out in Camp Pendleton, California.

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:19.655
Oorah!

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.831
Audience: Oorah!

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:21.856
(Laughter)

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.848
I joined a few months after September 11,

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:26.891
feeling like I think most people
in the country did at the time,

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:30.200
filled with a sense
of patriotism and retribution

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:31.866
and the desire to do something --

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.635
that, coupled with that fact
that I wasn't doing anything.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.905
I was 17, just graduated
from high school that past summer,

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.631
living in the back room
of my parents' house paying rent,

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.244
in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana,

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:44.426
called Mishawaka.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.028
I can spell that later
for people who are interested --

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:48.056
(Laughter)

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.940
Mishawaka is many good things
but cultural hub of the world it is not,

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:53.860
so my only exposure to theater and film

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:56.013
was limited to the plays
I did in high school

00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:58.265
and Blockbuster Video,
may she rest in peace.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.461
(Laughter)

00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:01.132
I was serious enough about acting

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:04.464
that I auditioned for Juilliard
when I was a senior in high school,

00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:05.639
didn't get in,

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:08.389
determined college wasn't for me
and applied nowhere else,

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:09.706
which was a genius move.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.181
I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.840
that I always heard stories about,

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:17.165
of actors moving to LA
with, like, seven dollars

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.132
and finding work and successful careers.

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:22.512
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
before my car broke down.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.263
I spent all my money repairing it,

00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:25.932
finally made it to Santa Monica --

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:27.234
not even LA --

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:29.917
stayed for 48 hours wandering
the beach, basically,

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.227
got in my car, drove home,

00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:32.957
thus ending my acting career, so --

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:34.259
(Laughter)

00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:36.171
Seventeen, Mishawaka ...

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:40.023
parents' house, paying rent,
selling vacuums ...

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:41.602
telemarketing,

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:43.809
cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds.

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.125
This was my world
going into September, 2001.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.300
So after the 11th,

00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:49.526
and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.901
and just being pissed off
in general -- at myself,

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:53.321
my parents, the government;

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.798
not having confidence,
not having a respectable job,

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:58.924
my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back --

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:01.921
I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.983
It's one of the things I'm most proud
of having done in my life.

00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:06.173
Firing weapons was cool,

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.632
driving and detonating
expensive things was great.

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:10.764
But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:13.429
for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:14.614
which was the people:

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:18.218
these weird dudes --
a motley crew of characters

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.624
from a cross section
of the United States --

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:22.979
that on the surface I had
nothing in common with.

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.611
And over time,

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.461
all the political and personal bravado

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:28.362
that led me to the military dissolved,

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:31.368
and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends.

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:33.680
And then, a few years into my service

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.783
and months away from deploying to Iraq,

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:38.672
I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident,

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.338
and had to be medically separated.

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:43.295
Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.382
but being told I wasn't getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:47.849
was very devastating for me.

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:51.114
I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.008
and my entire platoon is waiting
outside to see if I was OK.

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:56.466
And then, suddenly,
I was a civilian again.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.695
I knew I wanted to give
acting another shot,

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.523
because -- again, this is me --

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.266
I thought all civilian problems
are small compared to the military.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.047
I mean, what can you really
bitch about now, you know?

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:08.243
"It's hot.

00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:10.904
Someone should turn
on the air conditioner."

00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:12.728
"This coffee line is too long."

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:14.307
I was a Marine,

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:15.482
I knew how to survive.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.444
I'd go to New York and become an actor.

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:18.729
If things didn't work out,

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:21.737
I'd live in Central Park
and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.

00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.762
(Laughter)

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.476
I re-auditioned for Juilliard
and this time I was lucky,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.651
I got in.

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.216
But I was surprised
by how complex the transition was

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.541
from military to civilian.

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:34.040
And I was relatively healthy; I can't
imagine going through that process

00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:35.926
on top of a mental or physical injury.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.541
But regardless, it was difficult.

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.735
In part, because I was in acting school --

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.296
I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class,

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.588
throwing imaginary balls of energy
at the back of the room,

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:49.175
doing acting exercises
where I gave birth to myself --

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.200
(Laughter)

00:03:50.224 --> 00:03:52.958
while my friends were serving
without me overseas.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.591
But also, because I didn't
know how to apply the things

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:57.968
I learned in the military
to a civilian context.

00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:00.151
I mean that both practically
and emotionally.

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:01.744
Practically, I had to get a job.

00:04:01.768 --> 00:04:03.500
And I was an Infantry Marine,

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:06.080
where you're shooting machine guns
and firing mortars.

00:04:06.104 --> 00:04:09.651
There's not a lot of places you can
put those skills in the civilian world.

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:10.676
(Laughter)

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.722
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:15.064
In the military, everything has meaning.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.341
Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:18.693
or has a practical purpose.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.070
You can't smoke in the field

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.445
because you don't want
to give away your position.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.764
You don't touch your face --
you have to maintain

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:26.670
a personal level of health and hygiene.

00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:28.520
You face this way when "Colors" plays,

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:30.734
out of respect for people
who went before you.

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:32.898
Walk this way, talk this way
because of this.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:34.802
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:37.319
How diligently you followed
those rules spoke volumes

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.978
about the kind of Marine you were.

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:41.030
Your rank said something
about your history

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:42.538
and the respect you had earned.

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:44.394
In the civilian world there's no rank.

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:45.857
Here you're just another body,

00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.088
and I felt like I constantly had
to prove my worth all over again.

00:04:49.112 --> 00:04:52.112
And the respect civilians were giving me
while I was in uniform

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:53.762
didn't exist when I was out of it.

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:55.539
There didn't seem to be a ...

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:56.763
a sense of community,

00:04:56.787 --> 00:04:59.453
whereas in the military,
I felt this sense of community.

00:04:59.477 --> 00:05:01.206
How often in the civilian world

00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:04.982
are you put in a life-or-death situation
with your closest friends

00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:08.312
and they constantly demonstrate
that they're not going to abandon you?

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.389
And meanwhile, at acting school ...

00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:12.871
(Laughter)

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.569
I was really, for the first time,

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:16.878
discovering playwrights
and characters and plays

00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:18.865
that had nothing to do with the military,

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.244
but were somehow describing
my military experience

00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:23.815
in a way that before
to me was indescribable.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.230
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive

00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:29.457
as I was able to put words
to feelings for the first time

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:31.600
and realizing what
a valuable tool that was.

00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:34.104
And when I was reflecting
on my time in the military,

00:05:34.128 --> 00:05:36.539
I wasn't first thinking
on the stereotypical drills

00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:38.015
and discipline and pain of it;

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.253
but rather, the small,
intimate human moments,

00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:41.610
moments of great feeling:

00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:44.259
friends going AWOL
because they missed their families,

00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:45.518
friends getting divorced,

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:47.540
grieving together, celebrating together,

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.499
all within the backdrop of the military.

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.805
I saw my friends battling
these circumstances,

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.860
and I watched the anxiety
it produced in them and me,

00:05:54.884 --> 00:05:57.470
not being able to express
our feelings about it.

00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:01.074
The military and theater communities
are actually very similar.

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:03.823
You have a group of people
trying to accomplish a mission

00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:05.910
greater than themselves;
it's not about you.

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.902
You have a role, you have to know
your role within that team.

00:06:08.926 --> 00:06:11.085
Every team has a leader or director;

00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:13.659
sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not.

00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:16.287
You're forced to be intimate
with complete strangers

00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:17.596
in a short amount of time;

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.667
the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.

00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:22.615
I thought, how great would it be
to create a space

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.966
that combined these two seemingly
dissimilar communities,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.225
that brought entertainment
to a group of people

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.344
that, considering their occupation,

00:06:30.368 --> 00:06:32.812
could handle something
a bit more thought-provoking

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:34.669
than the typical mandatory-fun events

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:37.754
that I remember being
"volun-told" to go to in the military --

00:06:37.778 --> 00:06:38.780
(Laughter)

00:06:38.804 --> 00:06:41.082
all well-intended but slightly
offensive events,

00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:43.757
like "Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"

00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:45.957
where you answer a question
about pop culture,

00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:47.874
and if you get it right you win a date,

00:06:47.898 --> 00:06:50.244
which was a chaperoned walk
around the parade deck

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:52.659
with this already married,
pregnant cheerleader --

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:53.850
(Laughter)

00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:56.254
Nothing against cheerleaders,
I love cheerleaders.

00:06:56.278 --> 00:06:59.390
The point is more, how great would it
be to have theater presented

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:02.638
through characters that were accessible
without being condescending.

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:05.567
So we started this nonprofit
called Arts in the Armed Forces,

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.246
where we tried to do that,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.188
tried to join these two seemingly
dissimilar communities.

00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:14.027
We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays

00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:17.725
that are diverse in age and race
like a military audience is,

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:20.098
grab a group of incredible
theater-trained actors,

00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:21.975
arm them with incredible material,

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:24.219
keep production value
as minimal as possible --

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:27.279
no sets, no costumes,
no lights, just reading it --

00:07:27.303 --> 00:07:29.782
to throw all the emphasis on the language

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:32.521
and to show that theater can
be created at any setting.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:33.725
It's a powerful thing,

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.635
getting in a room with complete strangers

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.307
and reminding ourselves of our humanity,

00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:41.728
and that self-expression
is just as valuable a tool

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:43.109
as a rifle on your shoulder.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:45.138
And for an organization like the military,

00:07:45.162 --> 00:07:48.089
that prides itself on having
acronyms for acronyms,

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:49.536
you can get lost in the sauce

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.242
when it comes to explaining
a collective experience.

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.110
And I can think of no better community

00:07:54.134 --> 00:07:56.205
to arm with a new means of self-expression

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:58.251
than those protecting our country.

00:07:58.275 --> 00:08:00.755
We've gone all over
the United States and the world,

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.460
from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,

00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:05.930
to Camp Pendleton,
to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,

00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:07.663
to USAG Bavaria,

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.727
on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.

00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:11.823
And for the performing artists we bring,

00:08:11.847 --> 00:08:13.515
it's a window into a culture

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:15.699
they otherwise would not
have had exposure to.

00:08:15.723 --> 00:08:17.742
And for the military, it's the exact same.

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.753
And in doing this for the past six years,

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:22.008
I'm always reminded
that acting is many things.

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:25.237
It's a craft, it's a political act,
it's a business, it's --

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.013
whatever adjective
is most applicable to you.

00:08:28.037 --> 00:08:29.476
But it's also a service.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.024
I didn't get to finish mine,

00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:32.680
so whenever I get to be of service

00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:35.981
to this ultimate service industry,
the military, for me, again --

00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:38.052
there's not many things better than that.

00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:39.404
Thank you.

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:44.016
(Applause)

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.964
We're going to be doing a piece
from Marco Ramirez,

00:08:47.988 --> 00:08:49.682
called "I am not Batman."

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.734
An incredible actor
and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,

00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:53.933
is going to be reading,

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.441
and Matt Johnson,
who I just met a couple hours ago.

00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:58.616
They're doing it together
for the first time,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.878
so we'll see how it goes.

00:08:59.902 --> 00:09:01.821
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:04.999
(Applause)

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:14.636
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.970
and the sky is glowing
like mad, radioactive red.

00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:19.116
And if you squint,
you can maybe see the moon

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.006
through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
and airplane exhaust

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.321
that covers the whole city,

00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:25.643
like a mosquito net
that won't let the angels in.

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:26.707
(Drum beat)

00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.217
And if you look up high enough,

00:09:28.241 --> 00:09:31.678
you can see me standing
on the edge of an 87-story building.

00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:35.129
And up there, a place for gargoyles
and broken clock towers

00:09:35.153 --> 00:09:38.129
that have stayed still and dead
for maybe like 100 years,

00:09:38.153 --> 00:09:39.664
up there is me.

00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:40.718
(Beat)

00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:42.326
And I'm frickin' Batman.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.389
(Beat)

00:09:43.413 --> 00:09:45.578
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs

00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:47.997
and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.715
And all it takes is a broom closet

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:51.683
or a back room or a fire escape,

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.698
and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:56.618
And my navy blue polo shirt,

00:09:56.642 --> 00:10:00.119
the one that looks kinda good on me
but has that hole on it near the butt

00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:03.167
from when it got snagged
on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's

00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:05.883
but it isn't even a big deal
because I tuck that part in

00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:07.126
and it's, like, all good.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.067
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.098
And I get like, like ... transformational.

00:10:12.122 --> 00:10:13.122
(Beat)

00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:16.769
And nobody pulls out a belt
and whips Batman for talkin' back.

00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:17.810
(Beat)

00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:19.254
Or for not talkin' back.

00:10:19.278 --> 00:10:21.602
And nobody calls Batman simple

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:23.175
or stupid

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:24.396
or skinny.

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:28.003
And nobody fires Batman's brother
from the Eastern Taxi Company

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.059
'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:31.972
'Cause they got nothing but respect.

00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:34.131
And not like afraid-respect,

00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:36.534
just, like, respect-respect.

00:10:36.558 --> 00:10:37.559
(Laughter)

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:39.090
'Cause nobody's afraid of you.

00:10:39.114 --> 00:10:41.248
'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.

00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:42.273
(Beat)

00:10:42.297 --> 00:10:43.851
Ever.
(Double beat)

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:46.312
'Cause all Batman really wants
to do is save people

00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:48.083
and maybe pay abuela's bills one day

00:10:48.107 --> 00:10:49.258
and die happy.

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:51.478
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.

00:10:51.502 --> 00:10:52.513
(Laughter)

00:10:52.537 --> 00:10:53.874
Oh -- and kill the Joker.

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:55.358
(Drum roll)

00:10:55.382 --> 00:10:58.040
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.

00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:00.257
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:01.463
like a eagle

00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:02.657
or like a --

00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:04.390
no, yeah, like a eagle.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.415
(Laughter)

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:08.257
And my cape is flapping in the wind
cause it's frickin' long

00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:09.695
and my pointy ears are on,

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:12.549
and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too,

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:16.049
and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
all in my chest so no one can hurt me.

00:11:16.073 --> 00:11:17.787
And nobody -- nobody! --

00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:19.850
is gonna come between Batman ...

00:11:19.874 --> 00:11:21.053
and justice.

00:11:21.077 --> 00:11:22.879
(Drums)
(Laughter)

00:11:22.903 --> 00:11:24.411
From where I am,

00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:26.022
I can hear everything.

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:27.212
(Silence)

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.396
Somewhere in the city,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.636
there's a old lady picking
Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.510
and she's putting a piece
of sesame chicken someone spit out

00:11:34.534 --> 00:11:35.845
into her own mouth.

00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:39.178
And somewhere there's a doctor
with a wack haircut in a black lab coat

00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:41.060
trying to find a cure for the diseases

00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:44.042
that are gonna make us
all extinct for real one day.

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:45.426
And somewhere there's a man,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.847
a man in a janitor's uniform,

00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.804
stumbling home drunk and dizzy

00:11:48.828 --> 00:11:52.580
after spending half his paycheck
on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,

00:11:52.604 --> 00:11:55.548
and the other half on a four-hour visit
to some lady's house

00:11:55.572 --> 00:11:57.997
on a street where the lights
have all been shot out

00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:01.054
by people who'd rather do
what they do in this city in the dark.

00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:03.004
And half a block away from janitor man,

00:12:03.028 --> 00:12:05.942
there's a group of good-for-nothings
who don't know no better,

00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:08.490
waiting for janitor man
with rusted bicycle chains

00:12:08.514 --> 00:12:10.183
and imitation Louisville Sluggers,

00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:11.989
and if they don't find a cent on him,

00:12:12.013 --> 00:12:13.164
which they won't,

00:12:13.188 --> 00:12:16.546
they'll just pound at him till the muscles
in their arms start burning,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.643
till there's no more teeth to crack out.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.166
But they don't count on me.

00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:22.911
They don't count on no Dark Knight,

00:12:22.935 --> 00:12:25.929
with a stomach full of grocery-store
brand macaroni and cheese

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.542
and cut-up Vienna sausages.

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:28.567
(Laughter)

00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:31.147
'Cause they'd rather believe
I don't exist.

00:12:31.893 --> 00:12:35.506
And from 87 stories up, I can hear
one of the good-for-nothings say,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.831
"Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that,

00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:39.598
just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"

00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:43.175
And I see janitor man mumble something
in drunk language and turn pale,

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:44.376
and from 87 stories up,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.508
I can hear his stomach trying
to hurl its way out his Dickies.

00:12:47.532 --> 00:12:49.413
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast

00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:52.452
and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"

00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:54.931
And I throw a batarang
at the one naked lightbulb.

00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:55.994
(Cymbal)

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:58.146
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.761
Who just turned out the lights?"

00:12:59.785 --> 00:13:00.786
(Laughter)

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.479
"What's that over there?"
"What?"

00:13:02.503 --> 00:13:04.096
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.286
"Did anybody hear that?"

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.150
"Hear what? There ain't nothing.
No, really -- there ain't no bat!"

00:13:09.174 --> 00:13:10.401
But then ...

00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:13.904
one out of the three good-for-nothings
gets it to the head -- pow!

00:13:13.928 --> 00:13:16.785
And number two swings blindly
into the dark cape before him,

00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:18.618
but before his fist hits anything,

00:13:18.642 --> 00:13:20.546
I grab a trash can lid and --

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.757
right in the gut!

00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:23.896
And number one comes
back with the jump kick,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.551
but I know judo karate, too,
so I'm like --

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:30.356
(Drums)

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.531
Twice!

00:13:31.555 --> 00:13:32.556
(Drums)

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.805
(Laughter)

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.281
(Drums)

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.065
But before I can do any more damage,

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:39.288
suddenly we all hear a "click-click."

00:13:40.217 --> 00:13:42.453
And suddenly everything gets quiet.

00:13:43.049 --> 00:13:45.065
And the one good-for-nothing left standing

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.026
grips a handgun and aims it straight up,

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.631
like he's holding Jesus hostage,

00:13:48.655 --> 00:13:51.540
like he's threatening maybe
to blow a hole in the moon.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.836
And the good-for-nothing
who got it to the head,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.128
who tried to jump-kick me,

00:13:55.152 --> 00:13:57.645
and the other good-for-nothing
who got it in the gut,

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:00.550
is both scrambling back away
from the dark figure before 'em.

00:14:00.574 --> 00:14:02.257
And the drunk man, the janitor man,

00:14:02.281 --> 00:14:04.544
is huddled in a corner,
praying to Saint Anthony

00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:06.684
'cause that's the only one
he could remember.

00:14:06.708 --> 00:14:07.709
(Double beat)

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:08.885
And there's me:

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.680
eyes glowing white,

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:12.711
cape blowing softly in the wind.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:13.736
(Beat)

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.257
Bulletproof chest heaving,

00:14:15.281 --> 00:14:17.821
my heart beating right through it
in a Morse code for:

00:14:17.845 --> 00:14:18.996
"Fuck with me

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.171
just once

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:21.346
come on

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.520
just try."

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.910
And the one good-for-nothing
left standing,

00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:26.249
the one with the handgun --

00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:27.424
yeah, he laughs.

00:14:27.448 --> 00:14:28.630
And he lowers his arm.

00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:29.964
And he points it at me

00:14:29.988 --> 00:14:31.439
and gives the moon a break.

00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:33.636
And he aims it right
between my pointy ears,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.609
like goal posts and he's special teams.

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.113
And janitor man is still
calling Saint Anthony,

00:14:40.137 --> 00:14:41.493
but he ain't pickin' up.

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:43.955
And for a second,

00:14:43.979 --> 00:14:45.233
it seems like ...

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.765
maybe I'm gonna lose.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:52.057
Nah!

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:53.097
(Drums)

00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:54.306
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.481
"Don't kill me, man!"

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:57.463
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!

00:14:57.487 --> 00:15:01.470
Skin meets acid:
"Ahhhhhhh!"

00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:02.732
And he's on the floor

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:03.954
and I'm standing over him

00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:05.887
and I got the gun in my hands now

00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:08.575
and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em
'cause I'm Batman.

00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:09.777
And, asterisk:

00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:13.359
Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
got iced by guns a long time ago.

00:15:13.383 --> 00:15:14.598
But for just a second,

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:15.940
my eyes glow white,

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:17.123
and I hold this thing

00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:19.130
for I could speak to the good-for-nothing

00:15:19.154 --> 00:15:20.900
in a language he maybe understands.

00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.471
Click-click!

00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:23.508
(Beat)

00:15:23.532 --> 00:15:26.097
And the good-for-nothings
become good-for-disappearing

00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:29.816
into whatever toxic waste, chemical
sludge shithole they crawled out of.

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.760
And it's just me and janitor man.

00:15:33.555 --> 00:15:35.025
And I pick him up,

00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:38.182
and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
off his forehead.

00:15:38.206 --> 00:15:39.642
And he begs me not to hurt him

00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:42.196
and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.507
and I pull him to my face

00:15:43.531 --> 00:15:45.611
and he's taller than me
but the cape helps,

00:15:45.635 --> 00:15:48.028
so he listens when I look him
straight in the eyes.

00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:49.773
And I say two words to him:

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:52.075
"Go home."

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:54.528
And he does,

00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:57.020
checking behind his shoulder
every 10 feet.

00:15:57.044 --> 00:15:59.633
And I swoosh from building
to building on his way there

00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:01.061
'cause I know where he lives.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.889
And I watch his hands tremble
as he pulls out his key chain

00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:05.622
and opens the door to his building.

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:06.917
And I'm back in bed

00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:09.213
before he even walks in
through the front door.

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:11.167
And I hear him turn on the faucet

00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:13.447
and pour himself a glass
of warm tap water.

00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:15.692
And he puts the glass back in the sink.

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.800
And I hear his footsteps.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.685
And they get slower
as they get to my room.

00:16:21.758 --> 00:16:24.883
And he creaks my door open,
like, mad-slow.

00:16:25.953 --> 00:16:27.781
And he takes a step in,

00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:29.161
which he never does.

00:16:29.677 --> 00:16:30.677
(Beat)

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:32.797
And he's staring off into nowhere,

00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:35.486
his face, the color
of sidewalks in summer.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.091
And I act like I'm just waking up

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:39.524
and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"

00:16:40.452 --> 00:16:42.723
And janitor man says nothing to me.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:44.914
But I see in the dark,

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:46.311
I see his arms go limp

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:48.449
and his head turns back, like, towards me.

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:50.849
And he lifts it for I can see his face,

00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:52.739
for I could see his eyes.

00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:55.135
And his cheeks is drippin',
but not with sweat.

00:16:55.704 --> 00:16:57.485
And he just stands there breathing,

00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:59.941
like he remembers my eyes glowing white,

00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:02.655
like he remembers my bulletproof chest,

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.456
like he remembers he's my pop.

00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:12.531
And for a long time I don't say nothin'.

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:16.609
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.

00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:18.061
And he ain't looking my way,

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:20.627
but I hear him mumble two words to me:

00:17:22.253 --> 00:17:23.667
"I'm sorry."

00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:29.596
And I lean over, and I open
my window just a crack.

00:17:30.697 --> 00:17:32.382
If you look up high enough,

00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:34.612
you could see me.

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.936
And from where I am --

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.912
(Cymbals)

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:41.442
I could hear everything.

00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:52.500
(Applause)

00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:53.761
Thank you.

00:17:53.801 --> 00:18:01.140
(Applause)
