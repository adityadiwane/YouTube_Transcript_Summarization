00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I have had the distinct blessing in my life

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
But the coolest I ever worked on

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
was around this guy.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
This guy's name is TEMPT.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
And he came up home from a run one day

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And that was the onset of ALS.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
He only has use of his eyes.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I was exposed to him.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
I have a company that does design and animation,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
of what we admire and respect in the art world.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
So I went and met with his brother and father

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and said, "We're going to give you this money.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
What are you going to do with it?"

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I just want to be able to communicate with him

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and him to be able to communicate with me."

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
via these devices?"

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
you've got really amazing insurance,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
you can't actually do that.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
These devices aren't accessible to people."

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
That's how they communicate --

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
so run their finger along.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and instead, I wrote a check

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
isn't able to communicate it."

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I met these guys called GRL,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Graffiti Research Lab,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and they have a technology

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
that allows them to project a light onto any surface

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
and it just registers the negative space.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
So they go around and do art installations like this.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
First it starts with the sexual organs,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
then it starts with cuss words,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
then it was Bush slanders

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and then people actually got to art.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and was telling her about this,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
where you can use your eyes to control things,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
So that started the journey.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
And about two years later, about a year later,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
after a bunch of organization

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and a bunch of moving things around,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
we'd accomplished a couple things.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
and we actually got TEMPT a machine

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
(Applause)

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Which was awesome.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
The other thing we did

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
literally every corner of the world --

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
into our house.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
and these hackers and programmers

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and that we were going to come back

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
But for over two weeks,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
we programmed,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
we went to the Venice boardwalk,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
my kids got involved,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
my dog got involved,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
and we created this.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
This is called the EyeWriter,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and you can see the description.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
some copper wire

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
mounted it to an LED light,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and now there's a device that is free --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
you download the software for free.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And now we've created a device

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
that has absolutely no limitations.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
There's no insurance company that can say "No."

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
There's no hospital that can say "No."

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:38.260
(Applause)

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Thank you.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So at the end of the two weeks,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
we went back to TEMPT's room.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
and that's his room.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And after over a year of planning,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
two weeks of programming,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
carb-fest and all-night sessions,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And this is an amazing picture,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
because this is his life support system,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and he's looking over his life support system.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And we set up a projector

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
And he drew again for the first time,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
in front of his family and friends --

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and you can only imagine

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
what the feeling in the parking lot was.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
(Laughter)

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
So at the end of this, he sent us an email,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
and this is what the email said:

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I feel like I had been held underwater,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and someone finally reached down

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
and pulled my head up so I could breathe."

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Isn't that awesome?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
(Applause)

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
So that's kind of our battle cry.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
And we've got such a long way to go with this.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
This is an amazing device,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
So we're in the process of trying to figure out

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
how to make it better, faster, stronger.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
We've won a bunch of awards.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It's all coming out of our own pockets.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Armstrong Twittered about us,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
and then in December, Time magazine honored us

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
(Applause)

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
The coolest thing about this --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and this is what's completing the whole circle --

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
is that in April of this year,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
all of these guys will be there.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
TEMPT's going to be in the show,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
which is pretty awesome.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
(Applause)

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So basically this is my point:

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
If you see something that's not possible,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
make it possible.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Everything in this room wasn't possible --

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
wasn't possible at one point.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
Make it possible, everyone in this room.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
I'm not a programmer,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
never done anything with ocular recognition technology,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
so that we could make something happen.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
every single day

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
if not now, then when? And if not me, then who?

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Thank you guys.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.260
(Applause)
