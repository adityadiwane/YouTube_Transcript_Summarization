00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.024
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:20.119
that it is possible to transmit a video

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:24.452
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:29.636
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:33.069
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.

00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:35.927
And you may wonder, what's the point?

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.695
And the point is this:

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.075
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:43.909
to close the digital divide,

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:48.114
and also to allow for what we call
"The Internet of Things" --

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:51.304
tens of billions of devices
connected to the Internet.

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:55.359
In my view, such an extension
of the Internet can only work

00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:57.730
if it's almost energy-neutral.

00:00:58.173 --> 00:01:03.005
This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:08.434
And this is where the solar cell
and the LED come in.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.277
I demonstrated for the first time,

00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:13.266
at TED in 2011,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.274
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:21.776
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.092
and also in a safe and secure manner.

00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:28.283
Data is transported by the light,

00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:31.432
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.954
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,

00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:40.639
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:46.632
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:50.338
to receive the information
encoded in the data.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.832
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:57.862
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:02.540
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:08.144
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.535
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.965
But now we need to remember

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.220
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:24.593
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:27.548
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.088
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place

00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:38.222
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,

00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:41.021
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.163
correspond to the data transmitted.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.060
Of course the question is:

00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:50.244
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,

00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:54.078
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.145
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.416
We have shown in the lab

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.922
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:06.381
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:10.548
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:14.747
Now let me show you in practice.

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:21.483
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.768
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:27.975
it is connected to the laptop.

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.269
And also we have an instrument here

00:03:31.293 --> 00:03:35.071
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.

00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:37.893
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:42.198
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.

00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:45.942
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:48.072
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.204
for a moment,

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:54.222
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.

00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:56.594
So the solar cell, for a moment,

00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:00.140
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.818
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.025
I turn it on ...

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.768
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:13.909
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.

00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:17.742
And I've done this
by pressing this button.

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:22.489
So now this LED lamp here
is streaming a video

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:26.645
by changing the brightness of the LED
in a very subtle way,

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.167
and in a way that you can't
recognize with your eye,

00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.447
because the changes
are too fast to recognize.

00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:35.783
But in order to prove the point,

00:04:35.807 --> 00:04:38.952
I can block the light of the solar cell.

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:43.310
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:45.026
and the video stops as well.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.706
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:55.586
(Applause)

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.943
And I can repeat that.

00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:03.218
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.

00:05:03.242 --> 00:05:07.650
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:13.463
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.409
And so I want to simulate fog,

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.176
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.632
(Laughter)

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:24.616
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.

00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:27.533
First you notice

00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:31.754
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

00:05:31.778 --> 00:05:34.356
but now the video still continues.

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.388
This means, despite the blockage,

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:41.293
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,

00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:46.832
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:49.460
in this case, a high-definition video.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.603
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver

00:05:56.627 --> 00:06:00.442
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:05.282
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.

00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:08.291
That's why it is possible

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:12.172
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:14.689
to act as a broadband receiver

00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:19.089
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:23.300
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:24.825
And the same is true

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.642
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:32.198
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,

00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:36.765
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.865
that will form the Internet of Things.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.047
Because simply,

00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:42.562
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,

00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:45.561
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.

00:06:46.418 --> 00:06:48.148
As I said to you,

00:06:48.172 --> 00:06:50.490
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:52.569
It's very much a lab demonstration,

00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:53.796
a prototype.

00:06:54.276 --> 00:06:57.570
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market

00:06:57.594 --> 00:06:59.585
within the next two to three years.

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:05.544
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,

00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:06.766
and also contribute

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.735
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.895
And all of this without causing

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.371
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --

00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:16.617
because of the solar cells,
quite the opposite.

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.794
Thank you.

00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:23.000
(Applause)
