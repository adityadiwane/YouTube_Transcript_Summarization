00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:22.251
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.651
who died in her exile:

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:29.516
"Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:32.723
But don't you ever turn

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:38.846
into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:41.000
Almost two years have passed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.816
since the Libyan Revolution broke out,

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:48.566
inspired by the waves of mass mobilization

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:53.366
in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:58.466
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.666
to call for a day of rage

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:07.150
and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.183
And there it was, a great revolution.

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.883
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:18.067
calling for the fall of the regime,

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:23.283
raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.323
They have shown an exemplary bravery

00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:30.390
in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.905
They have shown a great sense of solidarity

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:37.389
from the far east to the far west to the south.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:43.305
Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:48.773
and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,

00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:54.156
we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:02:00.405
(Applause)

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:04.839
However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:12.174
a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:16.475
For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:24.924
destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:28.624
Aware of the devastation and the challenges,

00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:35.407
I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,

00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:38.899
calling for an inclusive and just transition

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.966
to democracy and national reconciliation.

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:45.783
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi

00:02:45.783 --> 00:02:48.682
during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:51.583
almost 300 in Tripoli.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:57.533
After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.750
and with unique enthusiasm,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.232
I started organizing workshops

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:07.064
on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:09.599
With an amazing group of women,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.381
I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,

00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:18.249
a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.850
to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.000
and to lobby for our right

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.117
for equal participation in building democracy and peace.

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:35.833
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.817
an environment which was increasingly polarized,

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:49.285
an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:53.367
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:57.501
to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,

00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:01.966
a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:05.050
the right to vote and run,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.201
and most importantly to stipulate on political parties

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:13.916
the alternation of male and female candidates

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:17.300
vertically and horizontally in their lists,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.133
creating the zipper list.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:26.478
Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.

00:04:26.478 --> 00:04:32.250
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.515
in the first elections ever in 52 years.

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:43.266
(Applause)

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:49.734
However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,

00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:53.466
and of the revolution as a whole,

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:55.050
was fading out --

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.516
for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:01.750
One day we wake up to the news

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.222
of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.017
On another day we wake up to the news

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:11.518
of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:13.600
On another day we wake up to the news

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.117
of the assassination of army officers.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:22.684
And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:27.534
and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:31.466
and their disrespect of the rule of law.

00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:35.002
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.963
became more polarized

00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:40.641
and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:43.707
freedom, dignity, social justice --

00:05:43.707 --> 00:05:45.407
that we first held.

00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:49.517
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:54.549
became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:59.199
I am here today not at all to inspire you

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.383
with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.584
I'm rather here today to confess

00:06:05.584 --> 00:06:12.366
that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:15.189
We did not prioritize right.

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:22.583
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:27.883
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates

00:06:27.883 --> 00:06:30.916
bring peace and national reconciliation?

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:33.333
No, it didn't.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:35.283
What is it, then?

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:41.466
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:48.767
with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:53.286
Maybe what was missing was not the women only,

00:06:53.286 --> 00:07:00.490
but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.863
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building

00:07:04.863 --> 00:07:06.663
more than it needed the elections,

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:10.648
which only reinforced polarization and division.

00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:16.913
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine

00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:22.930
more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.627
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.

00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:35.227
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.

00:07:35.227 --> 00:07:38.861
We need to develop a feminine discourse

00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:42.994
that not only honors but also implements

00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:51.358
mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,

00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:54.577
inclusion instead of exclusion.

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:57.684
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya

00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:01.159
needs desperately in order to achieve peace.

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:03.343
For peace has an alchemy,

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:10.426
and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:13.926
between the feminine and masculine perspectives.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.977
That's the real zipper.

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:19.026
And we need to establish that existentially

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:21.477
before we do so sociopolitically.

00:08:21.477 --> 00:08:24.376
According to a Quranic verse

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:30.877
"Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:36.612
In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,

00:08:36.612 --> 00:08:41.313
has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb --

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:47.147
symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity

00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:49.263
from which the male and the female,

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:54.796
from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.

00:08:54.796 --> 00:09:03.807
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,

00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:11.573
the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:16.940
Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.940
Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.523
May we all be granted a grace of mercy.

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:31.343
(Applause)

00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:33.447
Thank you.

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:38.867
(Applause)
