00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
Most of the talks

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
that you've heard in the last several fabulous days

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
have been from people who have the characteristic

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that they have thought about something,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
they are experts, they know what's going on.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
All of you know about the topic

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that I'm supposed to talk about.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
That is, you know what simplicity is,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
you know what complexity is.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
The trouble is, I don't.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And what I'm going to do is share with you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
my ignorance on this subject.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I want you to read this,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
because we're going to come back to it in a moment.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
The quote is from

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
the fabled Potter Stewart

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
opinion on pornography.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And let me just read it,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
the important details here:

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
But I know it when I see it."

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I'm going to come back to that in a moment.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So, what is simplicity?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
It's good to start with some examples.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
but it's much more interesting than one might think --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
a coffee cup is a device,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
which has a container and a handle.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
The handle enables you to hold it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
when the container is filled with hot liquid.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Why is that important?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Well, it enables you to drink coffee.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
the liquid is sterile;

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
you're not likely to get cholera that way.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
is one of the tools used by society

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to maintain public health.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Scissors are your clothes,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
glasses enable you to see things

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
or run down by automobiles,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and books are, after all, your education.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But there's another class of simple things,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
which are also very important.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Simple in function,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
but not at all simple in how they're constructed.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
And the two here are just examples.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
And it rests on a complexity,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
which has some characteristics

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
very different from those that my friend

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
but are very interesting.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
which, in a very simple way,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
fundamentally changed the structure of society

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
by changing the role of women in it

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
by providing to them

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
the opportunity to make reproductive choices.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And here I've corrupted

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the Potter Stewart quotation

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
by saying that we can think about something --

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
which spans all the way from scissors

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
to the cell phone,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Internet and birth control pills --

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
by saying that they're simple,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the functions are simple,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
and we recognize what that simplicity is

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
when we see it.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Or there may be another way of doing it,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
which is to think about the problem in terms of what --

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
if you associate with moral philosophers --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
is called the teapot problem.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
The teapot problem I'll pose this way.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Suppose you see a teapot,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
and the teapot is

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
filled with hot water.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And you then ask the question:

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Why is the water hot?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And that's a simple question.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
It's like, what is simplicity?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
One answer would be:

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and they bounce against things rapidly --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
that's a kind of physical science argument.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
A second argument would be:

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
that's an historical argument.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
A third is that I wanted hot water

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
for tea --

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that's an intentional argument.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
All of these are possibilities.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The point is that you get into trouble

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
when you ask a single question

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
with a single box for an answer,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
in which that single question actually is many questions

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
with quite different meanings,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
but with the same words.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
What is the state of science?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And, interestingly, complexity

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
is very highly evolved.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
We have a lot of interesting information

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
about what complexity is.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Simplicity, for reasons

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
that are a little bit obscure,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
is almost not pursued,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
at least in the academic world.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
We academics -- I am an academic --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
we love complexity.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
You can write papers about complexity,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and the nice thing about complexity is

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Simplicity -- all of you really would like

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
your Waring Blender in the morning

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
to make whatever a Waring Blender does,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
but not explode or play Beethoven.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
You're not interested in the limits of these things.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
So what one is interested in

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And there's a lot of rewards in thinking

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
about complexity and emergence,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
not so much in thinking about simplicity.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
One of the things I want to do

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
is to help you with a very important task --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
which you may not know that you have very often --

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
which is to understand

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
and have a conversation. (Laughter)

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
And the words that I would like you to focus on

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
are complexity and emergence,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
because these will enable you to start the conversation

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and then daydream about other things.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
(Laughter)

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
All right, what is complexity in this view of things,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
and what is emergence?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
It is a system, like traffic,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
which has components.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
The components interact with one another.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It turns out that, whenever you have that system,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
weird stuff happens,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
and you in Los Angeles

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
probably know this better than anyone.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Here's another example,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
which I put up because

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
it's an example of really important current science.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
but that's a tiny part

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
of the chemical reactions going on

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
in each of your cells at any given moment.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
And it's like the traffic that you see.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
The amazing thing about the cell is that

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
it actually does maintain a fairly stable

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
working relationship with other cells,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but we don't know why.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Anyone who tells you that we understand life,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
walk away.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And let me reduce this to the simplest level.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
We've heard from Bill Gates recently.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
All of us, to some extent, study

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
this thing called a Bill Gates.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
and you study that hard.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and you put them together,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
what can you say about this combination?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The answer is, not a lot.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
And that's complexity.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
All right, so let me give you an example

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
of simplicity

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
of a particular kind.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
And I want to introduce a word

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
that I think is very useful,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
which is stacking.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
that has the characteristic

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that it is so simple

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and so reliable

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
that I can build things with it.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Or I'm going to use simple to mean

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
reliable, predictable, repeatable.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
because it's a particularly good example

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
of stacked simplicity.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
We call it a complex system, which it is,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
but it's also something else.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
The Internet starts with mathematics,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
it starts with binary.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
we are familiar with the Arabic numbers

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
one to 10 and so on.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
In binary, one is 0001,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
seven is 0111.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
The question is: Why is binary

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
simpler than Arabic?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And the answer is, simply,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
but if I hold up this,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
of representing numbers.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Anything else is more complicated.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
You can catch errors with it,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
it's unambiguous in its reading,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
there are lots of good things about binary.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
So it is very, very simple

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
once you learn how to read it.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Now, if you like to represent

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
this zero and one of binary,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
you need a device.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And think of things in your life

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
that are binary,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
one of them is light switches.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
They can be on and off. That's binary.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Now wall switches, we all know, fail.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
managed to come up, some 50 years ago,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
which is a transistor.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
It turns things on and off,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
but it does so without moving parts

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So the second layer of simplicity

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
was the transistor in the Internet.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So, since the transistor is so simple,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
you can put lots of them together.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And you put lots of them together and you come with

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
something called integrated circuits.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
And a current integrated circuit

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
might have in each one of these chips

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
something like a billion transistors,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
all of which have to work perfectly every time.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
So that's the next layer of simplicity,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and, in fact, integrated circuits

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
are really simple in the sense that they,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
in general, work really well.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
With integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
the large majority of the time.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
but some of the time.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
But, in fact, if you have cell phones,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
you can now go to this nice lady

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
who's somewhere like Namibia,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
and who is extremely happy with the fact

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
that although she does not have

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
an master's degree in

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
electrical engineering from MIT,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to get power in some funny way.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
And from that comes the Internet.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The two blobs that are light in the middle there

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
are the United States and Europe.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
And then back to simplicity again.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
which is Google.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Which, in this simple portal

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
makes the claim

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
that it makes accessible

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
all of the world's information.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
But the point is that

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
that extraordinary simple idea

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
rests on layers of simplicity

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
each compounded into a complexity

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
that is itself simple,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
in the sense that it is completely reliable.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
All right, let me then finish off

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
with four general statements,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
an example and two aphorisms.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
The characteristics, which I think

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
are useful to think about for simple things:

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
First, they are predictable.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Their behavior is predictable.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Now, one of the nice characteristics

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
of simple things

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
is you know what it's going to do, in general.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
So simplicity and predictability

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
are characteristics of simple things.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
The second is, and this is a real world statement,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
they're cheap.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
If you have things that are cheap enough,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
people will find uses for them,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
even if they seem very primitive.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
So, for example, stones.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
You can build cathedrals out of stones,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
you just have to know what it does.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
You carve them in blocks and then you

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
pile them on top of one another,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and they support weight.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
and the cost has to be low.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
What that means is

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
that you have to have a high performance

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
or value for cost.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
And then I would propose

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
as this last component

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
that they serve, or have the potential to serve,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
as building blocks.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
That is, you can stack them.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
But if you have something that has a function,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and it's really cheap,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
people will find new ways of putting it together

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
to make new things.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Cheap, functional, reliable things

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
unleash the creativity of people

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
who then build stuff that you could not imagine.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
There's no way of predicting the Internet

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
based on the first transistor.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
It just is not possible.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
So these are the components.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
Now, the example

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
is something that I want to give you

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
from the work that we ourselves do.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
We are very interested in

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
delivering health care in the developing world,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
at as close to zero cost

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260
as we can manage.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
So, how does one do that?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
This is a world in which there's no electricity,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
there's no money, there's no medical competence.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
but in the lower right-hand corner,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
It's a little paper chip.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
It has a few things printed on it

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
using the same technology

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
that you use for making comic books,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
which was the inspiration for this particular idea.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
It wicks its way up into these little branches.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
You know, no power required.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
It turns colors. In this particular case,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
you're reading kidney function.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
And, since the health care worker

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
of much of this part of the world

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
who happens to be out of work and is willing

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
to go around and do this sort of thing,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
send the picture back to where there is a doctor,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and the doctor can look at it.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
So what you've done is to take a technology,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
which is available everywhere,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
make a device, which is extremely cheap,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and make it in such a fashion

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
that it is very, very reliable.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
If we can pull this off,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
if we can build more function,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
it will be stackable.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
That is to say, if we can make the basic technology

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
of one or two things work,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
it will be applicable to a very, very

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
large variety of human conditions,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and hence, extendable in both

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
vertical and horizontal directions.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Part of my interest in this, I have to say,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
change the way, or maybe eviscerate,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
which I think is fundamentally broken.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
So, let me close --

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.260
(Applause)

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Let me close with my two aphorisms.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
One of them is from Mr. Einstein,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
and he says, "Everything should be made

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
as simple as possible, but not simpler."

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
If you take too much out

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
of something that's simple, you lose function.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
You have to have low cost,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
but you also have to have a function.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
So you can't make it too simple.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
And the second is a design issue,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
This is by de Saint-Exupery.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
not when you have nothing more to add,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
but when you have nothing more to take away."

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And that certainly is going in the right direction.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
So, what I think one can begin to do

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
with this kind of

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
cut at the word simplicity,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
which doesn't cover Brancusi,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
it doesn't answer the question of

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
why Mondrian is better or worse

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
and certainly doesn't address the question

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
But it does make a point --

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
which is one which, in a sense,

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
differentiates the real world of people who make things,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
and the world of people who think about things,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
which is, there is an intellectual merit

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
to asking: How do we make things

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.260
as simple as we can,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
as cheap as we can, as functional as we can

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and as freely interconnectable as we can?

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and then give it to you guys,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:20.260
(Applause)

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
Chris Anderson: Quick question.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
So can you picture

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
that a science of simplicity

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
might get to the point where

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
you could look out at various systems --

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
"That has got to the point of danger

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
and this is how we might simplify it"?

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
at the components from which the system is made

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.260
and examine their fragility, or their stability,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
CA: Have you started to do that?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
radical solution on the cost side,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
but in terms of the system itself?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
GW: Well, no.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
How do I put that simply? No.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.260
CA: So, in terms of

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.260
that diagnostic technology that you've got,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.260
where is that, and when do you see that

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
maybe getting rolled out to scale.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
but the basic technology works.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
CA: You've got a company set up to ...

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.260
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you. (Applause)
