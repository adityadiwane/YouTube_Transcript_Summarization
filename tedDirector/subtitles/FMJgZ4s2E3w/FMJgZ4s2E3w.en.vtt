00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So today, I want us to reflect

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
on the demise of guys.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Guys are flaming out academically;

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
they're wiping out socially with girls

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and sexually with women.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
So what's the data?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
So the data on dropping out is amazing.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
to drop out of school.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Girls outperform boys now at every level,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
from elementary school to graduate school.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
There's a 10 percent differential

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
with guys falling behind girls.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And as you all know,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
boys are five times more likely than girls

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
What's the evidence of wiping out?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
with somebody else --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
and especially with somebody of the opposite sex

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
phosphorescent signals.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
(Laughter)

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
And every year there's research done

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
on self-reported shyness among college students.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And this is two kinds.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
It's a social awkwardness.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
They don't know the language of face contact,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
the non-verbal and verbal set of rules

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
listen to somebody else.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
which tries to account for why guys really prefer

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
male bonding over female mating.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
It turns out, from earliest childhood,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
boys, and then men,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
prefer the company of guys --

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
physical company.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
because guys have been with guys

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
especially in the military, and then in pubs.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.260
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
The problem is they now prefer

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
[the] asynchronistic Internet world

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
to the spontaneous interaction

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
in social relationships.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.260
excessive new access to pornography.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
The problem is these are arousal addictions.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Drug addiction, you simply want more.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Arousal addiction, you want different.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Jane McGonigal told us last year

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
that by the time a boy is 21,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
he's played 10,000 hours of video games,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
most of that in isolation.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
As you remember, Cindy Gallop said

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
men don't know the difference

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
between making love and doing porn.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
(Laughter)

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
15 billion annually.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
there are 11,000 now made porn videos.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
So the effect, very quickly,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
is it's a new kind of arousal.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
which are analog, static, interactively passive.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
They're also totally out of sync

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
in romantic relationships,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
which build gradually and subtly.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
So what's the solution? It's not my job.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
(Laughter)

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
(Applause)

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
But who should care? The only people who should care about this

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
is parents of boys and girls,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
educators, gamers, filmmakers

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and women who would like a real man

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
who they can talk to, who can dance,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
who can make love slowly

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and contribute to the evolutionary pressures

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
to keep our species above banana slugs.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:40.260
(Applause)
