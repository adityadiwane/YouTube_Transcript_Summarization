00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want to address the issue of compassion.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Compassion has many faces.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
some of them are tender; some of them are wise.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
A line that the Dalai Lama once said,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
They are not luxuries.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Without them,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
humanity cannot survive."

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
And I would suggest,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
it is not only humanity that won't survive,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
but it is all species on the planet,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
as we've heard today.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It is the big cats,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and it's the plankton.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I was so privileged

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
to be able to teach in a hospice

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
on the outskirts of Bangalore.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
And early in the morning,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I went into the ward.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
In that hospice,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
there were 31 men and women

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
who were actively dying.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And I walked up to the bedside

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
of an old woman

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
who was breathing very rapidly, fragile,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
obviously in the latter phase

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
of active dying.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I looked into her face.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I looked into the face

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
of her son sitting next to her,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and his face was just riven

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
with grief and confusion.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I remembered

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
a line from the Mahabharata,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
the great Indian epic:

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.260
"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And Yudhisthira replied,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
"The most wondrous thing in the world

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
is that all around us

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
people can be dying

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
and we don't realize

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
it can happen to us."

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
I looked up.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
Tending those 31 dying people

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
were young women

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
from villages around Bangalore.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
I looked into the face of one of these women,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and I saw in her face

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
the strength that arises

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
when natural compassion is really present.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I watched her hands

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
as she bathed an old man.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
My gaze went to another young woman

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
as she wiped the face

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
of another dying person.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And it reminded me

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of something that I had just been present for.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Every year or so,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
I have the privilege of taking clinicians

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And we run clinics

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
in these very remote regions

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
where there's no medical care whatsoever.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.260
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
far west of Nepal,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
the most impoverished region of Nepal,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
an old man came in

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
clutching a bundle of rags.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
we realized he was deaf,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and we looked into the rags,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and there was this pair of eyes.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
The rags were unwrapped

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
from a little girl

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
whose body was massively burned.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Again,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the eyes and hands

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
of Avalokiteshvara.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
It was the young women, the health aids,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
who cleaned the wounds of this baby

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and dressed the wounds.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
I know those hands and eyes;

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
they touched me as well.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
They touched me at that time.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
They touched me when I was four

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and I lost my eyesight

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and was partially paralyzed.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
And my family brought in

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
a woman whose mother had been a slave

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
to take care of me.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
And that woman

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
did not have sentimental compassion.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
She had phenomenal strength.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
And it was really her strength, I believe,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
that has been a guiding light in my life.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So we can ask:

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
What is compassion comprised of?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And there are various facets.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
But first, compassion is comprised

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
of that capacity

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
to see clearly

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
into the nature of suffering.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
It is that ability

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
to really stand strong

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
and to recognize also

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
that I'm not separate from this suffering.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
But that is not enough,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
because compassion,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
which activates the motor cortex,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
means that we aspire,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
we actually aspire to transform suffering.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And if we're so blessed,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
we engage in activities

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
that transform suffering.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
But compassion has another component,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and that component is really essential.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
That component

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
is that we cannot be attached to outcome.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Now I worked with dying people

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
for over 40 years.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
I had the privilege of working on death row

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
in a maximum security [prison] for six years.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And I realized so clearly

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
in bringing my own life experience,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
from working with dying people

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
and training caregivers,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
that any attachment to outcome

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
would distort deeply

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
my own capacity to be fully present

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
to the whole catastrophe.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And when I worked in the prison system,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
it was so clear to me, this:

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
that many of us

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
in this room,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
That compassion is actually

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
an inherent human quality.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It is there within every human being.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
But the conditions

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.260
for compassion to be activated,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
to be aroused,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
are particular conditions.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
I had that condition, to a certain extent,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
from my own childhood illness.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
has had that condition activated

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
amazingly in her

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
through the various waters of suffering

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that she has been through.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
And what is fascinating

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
is that compassion has enemies,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.260
and those enemies are things like pity,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
moral outrage,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
fear.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And you know, we have a society, a world,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
that is paralyzed by fear.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And in that paralysis, of course,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
our capacity for compassion

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
is also paralyzed.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
The very word terror

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
is global.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
The very feeling of terror is global.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
So our work, in a certain way,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
is to address this imago,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
this kind of archetype

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that has pervaded the psyche

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
of our entire globe.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Now we know from neuroscience

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
that compassion has

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
some very extraordinary qualities.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
For example:

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
A person who is cultivating compassion,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
when they are in the presence of suffering,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
they feel that suffering a lot more

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
than many other people do.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
However,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
they return to baseline a lot sooner.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
This is called resilience.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Many of us think that compassion drains us,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
but I promise you

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
it is something that truly enlivens us.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Another thing about compassion

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It hooks up all parts of the brain.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Another, which has been discovered

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
by various researchers

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
at Emory and at Davis and so on,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
is that compassion enhances our immune system.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Hey,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
we live in a very noxious world.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
(Laughter)

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
Most of us are shrinking

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
of the toxins of our world.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But compassion, the generation of compassion,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
actually mobilizes

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
our immunity.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
You know, if compassion is so good for us,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
I have a question.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Why don't we train our children

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in compassion?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.260
(Applause)

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
If compassion is so good for us,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.260
why don't we train our health care providers in compassion

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
so that they can do what they're supposed to do,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
which is to really transform suffering?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And if compassion is so good for us,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.260
why don't we vote on compassion?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
Why don't we vote for people in our government

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
based on compassion,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
so that we can have

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
a more caring world?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
In Buddhism,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
It takes tremendous strength of the back

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
But it also takes a soft front --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
to have an undefended heart.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
And the archetype of this in Buddhism

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
It's a female archetype:

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
she who perceives

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.260
the cries of suffering in the world.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.260
She stands with 10,000 arms,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and in every hand,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
there is an instrument of liberation,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and these are the eyes of wisdom.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
I say that, for thousands of years,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
women have lived,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.260
exemplified, met in intimacy,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
the archetype of Avalokitesvara,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
of Kuan-Yin,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
she who perceives

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
the cries of suffering in the world.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Women have manifested for thousands of years

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
the strength arising from compassion

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
in an unfiltered, unmediated way

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
in perceiving suffering

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
as it is.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
They have infused societies with kindness,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and we have really felt that

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
as woman after woman

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
has stood on this stage

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
in the past day and a half.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
And they have actualized compassion

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
through direct action.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Jody Williams called it:

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
It's good to meditate.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
(Laughter)

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
But the other side of the equation

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
is you've got to come out of your cave.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
You have to come into the world

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
like Asanga did,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
after 12 years sitting in the cave.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
He said, "I'm out of here."

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
He's going down the path.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
He sees something in the path.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.260
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
The wound is just filled with maggots.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
He puts out his tongue

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
in order to remove the maggots,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
so as not to harm them.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
And at that moment,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
the dog transformed

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
into the Buddha of love and kindness.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
I believe

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
that women and girls today

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.260
have to partner in a powerful way with men --

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
with their fathers,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
with their sons, with their brothers,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
with the plumbers, the road builders,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
with our president,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and with all beings.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
The women in this room

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
are lotuses in a sea of fire.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
May we actualize that capacity

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
for women everywhere.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
Thank you.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:12.260
(Applause)
