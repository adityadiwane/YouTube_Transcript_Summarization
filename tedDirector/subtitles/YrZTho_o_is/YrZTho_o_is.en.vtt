00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:14.665
So, when I was in art school,

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.084
I developed a shake in my hand,

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:19.116
and this was the straightest line I could draw.

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.767
Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:24.956
like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.654
but at the time this was really doomsday.

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:31.271
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.641
The shake developed out of, really,

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.548
a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:38.102
just years of making tiny, tiny dots.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:41.996
And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round

00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:45.684
to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:47.929
So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.244
and this progressively made the shake worse,

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.516
so I'd hold the pen tighter still.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.732
And this became a vicious cycle that ended up

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.956
causing so much pain and joint issues,

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.172
I had trouble holding anything.

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:02.557
And after spending all my life wanting to do art,

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:07.168
I left art school, and then I left art completely.

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.628
But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:11.920
and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.780
and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.509
And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.932
and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:23.542
So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.450
and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.544
I was making all these scribble pictures.

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:29.374
And even though it wasn't the kind of art

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:33.030
that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.509
And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.884
I realized I could still make art.

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:39.154
I just had to find a different approach

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:41.507
to making the art that I wanted.

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:44.347
Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:46.176
seeing these little tiny dots come together

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:48.157
to make this unified whole.

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:51.108
So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:53.286
where the shake wouldn't affect the work,

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:57.763
like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:01.461
or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,

00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:06.924
creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:10.268
I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,

00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:12.676
my hand really wouldn't hurt,

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:16.276
and after having gone from a single approach to art,

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.527
I ended up having an approach to creativity

00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:22.228
that completely changed my artistic horizons.

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:24.148
This was the first time I'd encountered this idea

00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:29.620
that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.036
At the time, I was finishing up school,

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:35.644
and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:39.405
I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:41.515
I could do so much more with the supplies

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.047
I thought an artist was supposed to have.

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:46.252
I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:48.764
I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:51.012
from the office that I worked at.

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:53.944
So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:55.598
I got myself to the art store,

00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:58.712
and I just went nuts buying supplies.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:00.340
And then when I got home, I sat down

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.448
and I set myself to task to really try to create something

00:03:03.448 --> 00:03:06.212
just completely outside of the box.

00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:10.636
But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:13.183
The same thing the next day, and then the next,

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:16.872
quickly slipping into a creative slump.

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:21.120
And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.694
And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able

00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:28.068
to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.

00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:30.280
But as I searched around in the darkness,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.808
I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.376
that I never had before.

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:40.099
And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.816
Embrace the shake.

00:03:42.816 --> 00:03:45.492
And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:49.256
I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box

00:03:49.256 --> 00:03:51.972
and get back into it.

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:54.058
I wondered, could you become more creative, then,

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:56.956
by looking for limitations?

00:03:56.956 --> 00:04:02.137
What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:04.410
At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in --

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.183
well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —

00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:10.391
but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,

00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.784
so I decided to ask for 50.

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:14.567
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.555
and then with some pencils I already had,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:19.735
I made this project for only 80 cents.

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.271
It really became a moment of clarification for me

00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.151
that we need to first be limited

00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.199
in order to become limitless.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.207
I took this approach of thinking inside the box

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.110
to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.439
painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.023
So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,

00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:39.223
one on top of another,

00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:43.723
with each picture representing an influence in my life.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:46.375
Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.127
I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:50.603
So I'd dip my hands in paint,

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:52.023
and I just attacked the canvas,

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:54.732
and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.664
and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:01.027
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:05.232
Or, what if instead of relying on myself,

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:07.165
I had to rely on other people

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:09.817
to create the content for the art?

00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:12.608
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.

00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:15.248
I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.553
and I asked people to call me and share a story with me

00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:20.236
about a life-changing moment.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.688
Their stories became the art

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:26.200
as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.665
(Applause)

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:35.161
Or what if instead of making art to display,

00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:37.424
I had to destroy it?

00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:39.696
This seemed like the ultimate limitation,

00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:42.188
being an artist without art.

00:05:42.188 --> 00:05:44.736
This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:46.089
that I called Goodbye Art,

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.785
where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.276
In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:55.003
forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,

00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:57.808
made with over 7,000 matches.

00:05:57.808 --> 00:05:58.974
(Laughter)

00:05:58.974 --> 00:06:02.163
Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.

00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:04.776
I looked for temporary materials,

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.950
like spitting out food --

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.012
(Laughter) —

00:06:11.012 --> 00:06:14.225
sidewalk chalk

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:18.761
and even frozen wine.

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:20.822
The last iteration of destruction

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:24.865
was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.

00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:28.208
So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:31.848
then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,

00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:35.761
then assembled the videos into the larger image.

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:40.280
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.122
It was destroyed before it ever existed.

00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:46.608
In the course of this Goodbye Art series,

00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:49.440
I created 23 different pieces

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.752
with nothing left to physically display.

00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:55.176
What I thought would be the ultimate limitation

00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:58.104
actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,

00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:00.307
as each time I created,

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:02.319
the destruction brought me back to a neutral place

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.604
where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.

00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:08.960
It did not happen overnight.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.011
There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:13.800
or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.312
the end image was kind of embarrassing.

00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:19.032
But having committed to the process, I continued on,

00:07:19.032 --> 00:07:21.043
and something really surprising came out of this.

00:07:21.043 --> 00:07:24.009
As I destroyed each project,

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.841
I was learning to let go,

00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:30.352
let go of outcomes, let go of failures,

00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:32.875
and let go of imperfections.

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.304
And in return, I found a process of creating art

00:07:35.304 --> 00:07:39.529
that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.558
I found myself in a state of constant creation,

00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:44.056
thinking only of what's next

00:07:44.056 --> 00:07:46.952
and coming up with more ideas than ever.

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:49.437
When I think back to my three years away from art,

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:52.688
away from my dream, just going through the motions,

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.440
instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.640
I just quit, I gave up.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.256
And what if I didn't embrace the shake?

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:04.453
Because embracing the shake for me

00:08:04.453 --> 00:08:07.093
wasn't just about art and having art skills.

00:08:07.093 --> 00:08:11.528
It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.

00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:14.039
Because ultimately, most of what we do

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:19.611
takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.

00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:23.280
Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.359
is the best hope we have to transform ourselves

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:31.224
and, collectively, transform our world.

00:08:31.224 --> 00:08:35.392
Looking at limitations as a source of creativity

00:08:35.392 --> 00:08:38.248
changed the course of my life.

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:39.939
Now, when I run into a barrier

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:43.048
or I find myself creatively stumped,

00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:44.602
I sometimes still struggle,

00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:46.696
but I continue to show up for the process

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:50.193
and try to remind myself of the possibilities,

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:54.788
like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,

00:08:54.788 --> 00:08:59.175
using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:05.198
or painting a picture with hamburger grease.

00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:07.052
(Laughter)

00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:08.659
One of my most recent endeavors

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:12.103
is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned

00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:15.287
into something others can replicate.

00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:19.144
Limitations may be the most unlikely of places

00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:22.538
to harness creativity, but perhaps

00:09:22.538 --> 00:09:26.208
one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:30.111
rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.970
And instead of telling each other to seize the day,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.933
maybe we can remind ourselves every day

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:40.447
to seize the limitation.

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:41.914
Thank you.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:47.191
(Applause)
