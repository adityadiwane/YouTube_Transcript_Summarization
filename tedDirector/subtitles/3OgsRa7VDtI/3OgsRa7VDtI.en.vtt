00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.635
I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.771
about a story that we have all
been conditioned to believe

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:19.335
is not possible.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.657
It's a story about a living,
breathing start-up

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.076
flourishing in an unlikely environment:

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.926
the United States government.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.584
Now, this start-up is fundamentally
beginning to disrupt

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.096
the way government does
business from the inside out.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.620
But before I get there,
let's start with the problem.

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:37.343
For me, the problem begins
with a number: 137.

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:41.417
137 is the average number of days

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.852
a veteran has to wait to have benefits
processed by the VA.

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.008
137 days.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:49.787
Now, in order to file that application
in the first place,

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.399
she has to navigate
over 1,000 different websites

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:56.216
and over 900 different call-in numbers,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.441
all owned and operated
by the United States government.

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:02.925
Now, we live in times
of incredible change.

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.716
The private sector is constantly changing

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.505
and improving itself all the time.

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:10.967
For that matter, it's removing
every single inconvenience in my life

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:12.784
that I could possibly think of.

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.363
I could be sitting on my couch
in my apartment,

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.429
and from my phone, I can order
a warm, gluten-free meal

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.432
that can arrive at my door
in less than 10 minutes.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:25.679
But meanwhile, a working mother
who depends on food stamps

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.764
to support her family

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.927
has to complete an arduous,
complicated application

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.412
which she might not even
be able to do online.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:37.578
And the inability of her to do that same
work from her couch means

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:40.682
that she might be having to take
days or hours off of work

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:42.094
that she can't spare.

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:45.689
And this growing dichotomy

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:48.007
between the beneficiaries
of the tech revolution

00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:49.426
and those it's left behind

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.972
is one of the greatest
challenges of our time --

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:56.385
(Applause)

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:01.862
Because government's failure
to deliver digital services that work

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:06.440
is disproportionately impacting
the very people who need it most.

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:09.083
It's impacting the students
trying to go to college,

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:11.161
the single mothers
trying to get health care,

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:12.962
the veterans coming home from battle.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:16.058
They can't get what they need
when they need it.

00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:17.468
And for these Americans,

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:21.147
government is more than just
a presidential election every four years.

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.237
Government is a lifeline
that provides services they need

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.586
and depend on and deserve.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.777
Which is, quite frankly,

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:30.984
why government needs to get
its shit together and catch up.

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:32.167
Just saying.

00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:35.501
(Applause)

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.871
Now, this wasn't always a problem
I was passionate about.

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:41.655
When I joined President Obama's
campaign in 2008,

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.836
we brought the tech industry's
best practices into politics.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.591
We earned more money,

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:48.336
we engaged more volunteers

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.034
and we earned more votes
than any political campaign in history.

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:55.840
We were a cutting-edge start-up
that changed the game of politics forever.

00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:58.123
So when the President asked
a small group of us

00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:00.998
to bring that very same disruption
directly into government,

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:02.889
I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.671
but I was eager and showed up
ready to get to work.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.441
Now, on my first day in DC,

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:11.975
my first day in government,

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.940
I walked into the office
and they handed me a laptop.

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:17.424
And the laptop was running Windows 98.

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:18.822
(Laughter)

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:22.538
I mean, three entire presidential
elections had come and gone

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:25.919
since the government had updated
the operating system on that computer.

00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:27.354
Three elections!

00:03:28.093 --> 00:03:29.638
Which is when we realized

00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:33.726
this problem was a whole lot bigger
than we ever could have imagined.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.506
Let me paint the picture for you.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.073
The federal government is the largest
institution in the world.

00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:44.669
It spends over 86 billion dollars
a year -- 86 billion --

00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:46.346
on federal IT projects.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.914
For context:

00:03:47.938 --> 00:03:50.859
that is more than the entire
venture capital industry spends

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:52.679
annually -- on everything.

00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:55.389
Now, the problem here

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:59.524
is that we the taxpayers
are not getting what we pay for,

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.365
because 94 percent of federal IT projects

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.604
are over budget or behind schedule.

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:07.064
94 percent!

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:08.577
For those of you keeping score,

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.910
yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:12.402
(Laughter)

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:14.600
There's another problem:

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:18.388
40 percent of those never end up
seeing the light of day.

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:20.990
They are completely scrapped or abandoned.

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:25.772
Now, this is a very existentially
painful moment for any organization,

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:28.193
because it means as government
continues to operate

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:29.432
as it's programmed to do,

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.071
failure is nearly inevitable.

00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:34.946
And when the status quo
is the riskiest option,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.018
that means there is simply no other choice

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.784
than radical disruption.

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.257
So, what do we do about it?

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:44.416
How do we fix this?

00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:47.682
Well, the irony of all of this

00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.979
is that we actually don't have to look
any further than our backyard,

00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:54.868
because right here in America
are the very ideas, the very people,

00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:57.562
who have swept our world
into a radically different place

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.252
than it was two decades ago.

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:01.557
So what would it look like

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:04.921
if it was actually as easy to get
student loans or veterans' benefits

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:07.787
as it is to order cat food to my house?

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.124
What would it look like

00:05:10.628 --> 00:05:14.561
if there was an easy pathway
for the very entrepreneurs and innovators

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.348
who have disrupted our tech sector

00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:18.387
to come and disrupt their government?

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:21.119
Well, my friends,
here's where we get to talk

00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:23.790
about some of the exciting
new formulas we've discovered

00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:25.487
for creating change in government.

00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:27.742
Enter the United States Digital Service.

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:31.799
The United States Digital Service
is a new network of start-ups,

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:33.378
a team of teams,

00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:37.282
organizing themselves across government
to create radical change.

00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:41.675
The mission of the United States
Digital Service is to help government

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.787
deliver world-class digital services

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:48.340
for students, immigrants,
children, the elderly -- everybody --

00:05:48.364 --> 00:05:50.759
at dramatically lower costs.

00:05:51.664 --> 00:05:55.139
We are essentially trying to build
a more awesome government,

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:57.264
for the people, by the people, today.

00:05:57.288 --> 00:05:59.138
We don't care -- (Applause) Thank you.

00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:01.354
(Applause)

00:06:01.378 --> 00:06:03.869
Who doesn't want a more
awesome government, right?

00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:07.130
We don't care about politics.

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:09.344
We care about making
government work better,

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:11.430
because it's the only one we've got.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.224
(Applause)

00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:17.106
Now, you can think of our team --
well, it's pretty funny --

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.182
you can think
of our team a little bit like

00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:21.816
the Peace Corps meets DARPA
meets SEAL Team 6.

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:24.079
We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,

00:06:24.103 --> 00:06:27.076
but instead of traveling to crazy,
interesting, far-off places,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.489
you spend a lot of time indoors,
behind computers,

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:31.758
helping restore the fabric
of our democracy.

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:33.501
(Laughter)

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:38.173
Now, this team -- our playbook
for the United States Digital Service

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.537
is pretty simple.

00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:43.657
The first play is we recruit
the very best talent

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:45.394
our country has to offer,

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:48.423
and recruit them for short tours
of duty inside government.

00:06:48.447 --> 00:06:51.949
These are the very people who have helped
build the products and companies

00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:55.356
that have made our tech sector amongst
the most innovative in the world.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.549
Second, we pair these incredible
people from the tech core

00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:01.439
with the dedicated civil servants
already inside government

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.581
on the ground creating change.

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:07.491
Third, we strategically deploy them
in a targeted formation

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:10.675
at the most mission-critical,
life-changing, important services

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.206
that government offers.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.873
And finally, we give them
massive air cover,

00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:16.772
from the leadership inside the agencies

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:19.162
all the way up to the President himself,

00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:21.707
to transform these services
for the better.

00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:25.252
Now, this team is beginning to disrupt

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:27.949
how government does business
from the inside out.

00:07:28.538 --> 00:07:31.545
If you study classic
patterns of disruption,

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:34.228
one very common pattern is rather simple.

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:37.855
It's to take something that has become
routine and standard in one industry

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.419
and apply it to another
where it's a radical departure

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:41.712
from the status quo.

00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:45.052
Think about what Airbnb took
that was normal from hospitality

00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:47.264
and revolutionized my apartment.

00:07:48.058 --> 00:07:50.924
The United States Digital Service
is doing exactly that.

00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:54.242
We are taking what Silicon Valley
and the private sector has learned

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:55.568
through a ton of hard work

00:07:55.592 --> 00:07:58.203
about how to build
planetary-scale digital services

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:00.091
that delight users at lower cost,

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:01.955
and we're applying that to government,

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:04.875
where it is a radical departure
from the status quo.

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:06.923
Now, the good news is:

00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:08.879
it's starting to work.

00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:12.198
We know this because we can
already see the results

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:15.859
from some of our early projects,
like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:17.473
when that went off the rails.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.201
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place
that we ran this play,

00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:23.082
and today we are taking that same play

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:24.852
and scaling it across a large number

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:28.284
of government's most important
citizen-facing services.

00:08:29.077 --> 00:08:31.324
Now, if I can take a moment

00:08:31.348 --> 00:08:33.451
and brag about the team for a second --

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:36.062
it is the highest
concentration of badasses

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.290
I could have ever dreamed of.

00:08:38.314 --> 00:08:42.142
We have top talent from Google,
Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:44.327
all on staff today,

00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:47.675
all choosing to join their government.

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:48.939
And what's incredible is,

00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:52.898
everybody is as eager and kind
as they are intelligent.

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:56.382
And I might add, by the way,
over half of us are women.

00:08:56.406 --> 00:09:00.511
(Applause)

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:05.583
The best way to understand this strategy

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:07.867
is actually to walk through
a couple of examples

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.621
of how it's working out in the wild.

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:11.657
I'm going to give you
two examples quickly.

00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:13.497
The first one is about immigration.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:17.601
This, my friends, is your typical
immigration application.

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:18.788
Yes, you guessed it --

00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:21.286
it's almost entirely paper-based.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.461
In the best case,

00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:25.293
the application takes about six
to eight months to process.

00:09:25.317 --> 00:09:29.150
It is physically shipped thousands
of miles -- thousands of miles! --

00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:31.614
between no less than six
processing centers.

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:33.558
Now, little story:

00:09:34.168 --> 00:09:35.319
about a decade ago,

00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:38.220
the government thought
that if it brought this system online,

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.118
it could save taxpayer dollars
and provide a better service,

00:09:41.142 --> 00:09:42.293
which was a great idea.

00:09:42.317 --> 00:09:45.058
So, the typical government process began.

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:50.263
Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,

00:09:50.287 --> 00:09:52.568
no working product was delivered --

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.678
1.2 billion with a "B."

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.022
Now at this point, the agency responsible,

00:09:58.046 --> 00:09:59.969
US Citizenship and Immigration Services,

00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:02.757
could have kept pouring money
into the failing program.

00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:04.424
Sadly, that's what often happens.

00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:06.051
That's the status quo today.

00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:07.236
But they didn't.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.478
The dedicated civil servants
inside the agency

00:10:09.502 --> 00:10:11.801
decided to stand up and call for change.

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:14.473
We deployed a small team
of just six people,

00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:16.179
and what many people don't know is

00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:19.134
that's the same size as the rescue
effort of Healthcare.gov --

00:10:19.158 --> 00:10:20.379
just six people.

00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:22.234
And that team jumped in, side-by-side,

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:24.972
to support the agency
in transitioning this project

00:10:24.996 --> 00:10:28.749
into more modern business practices,
more modern development practices.

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:30.381
Now, in non-tech speak,

00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:34.387
what that basically means
is taking big, multi-year projects

00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:36.726
and breaking them up
into bite-sized chunks,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.386
so that way we can reduce the risk

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.047
and actually start to see results
every couple of weeks,

00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:43.232
instead of waiting
in a black box for years.

00:10:43.256 --> 00:10:46.462
So within less than three months
of our team being on the ground,

00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:49.731
we were already able to push
our first products to production.

00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:52.764
The first one, this is the form I-90.

00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:56.184
This is used to file
for your replacement green card.

00:10:56.208 --> 00:10:57.773
Now, for immigrant visa holders,

00:10:57.797 --> 00:11:00.685
a replacement green card is a big deal.

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.967
Your green card is your proof
of identification,

00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:04.380
it's your work authorization,

00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:06.853
it's the proof that you can
be here in this country.

00:11:06.877 --> 00:11:10.098
So waiting six months while the government
processes the replacement

00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:11.322
is not cool.

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:13.037
I'm excited to tell you that today,

00:11:13.061 --> 00:11:16.218
you can now, for the first time,
file for a replacement green card

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:19.445
entirely online without anyone
touching a piece of paper.

00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:21.487
It is faster, it is cheaper,

00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:23.908
and it's a better user experience
for the applicant

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:25.820
and the government employees alike.

00:11:25.844 --> 00:11:29.361
(Applause)

00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:33.828
Another one, quickly.

00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:37.099
Last fall, we just released
a brand-new practice civics test.

00:11:37.123 --> 00:11:39.363
So as part of becoming a US citizen,

00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:41.737
you have to pass a civics test.

00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:46.099
For anyone who has taken this test,
it can be quite the stressful process.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:50.710
So our team released a very easy,
simple-to-use tool in plain language

00:11:50.734 --> 00:11:52.890
to help people prepare,

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:54.588
to help ease their nerves,

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:56.342
to help them feel more confident

00:11:56.366 --> 00:11:59.797
in taking the next step
in pursuing their American dream.

00:11:59.821 --> 00:12:02.732
Because all of this work,
all of this work on immigration,

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:06.591
is about taking complicated processes
and making them more human.

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:10.557
The other day, one of the dedicated
civil servants on the ground

00:12:10.581 --> 00:12:13.459
said something incredibly profound.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:16.706
She said that she's never been
this hopeful or optimistic

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.443
about a project in her entire
time in government.

00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:22.468
And she's been doing this for 30 years.

00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:25.706
That is exactly the kind of hope
and culture change

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.998
we are trying to create.

00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:30.919
For my second example, I want to bring
it back to veterans for a second,

00:12:30.943 --> 00:12:32.893
and what we are doing to build them a VA

00:12:32.917 --> 00:12:35.732
that is worthy of their service
and their sacrifice.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:38.297
I'm proud to say
that just a few months ago,

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.217
we released a brand-new beta

00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:42.309
of a new website, Vets.gov.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.905
Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:48.665
that brings all of the online services
a veteran needs into one place.

00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:51.404
One website, not thousands.

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:55.165
The site is a work in progress,
but it's significant progress,

00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:57.776
because it's designed
with the users who matter most:

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.705
the veterans themselves.

00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:02.522
This might sound incredibly obvious,
because it should be,

00:13:02.546 --> 00:13:04.768
but sadly, this isn't
normal for government.

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:08.236
Far too often, product decisions
are made by committees of stakeholders

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.942
who do their best to represent
the interests of the user,

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:13.270
but they're not necessarily
the users themselves.

00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:15.835
So our team at the VA went out,
we looked at the data,

00:13:15.859 --> 00:13:17.523
we talked to veterans themselves

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.135
and we started simple and small,

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:22.543
with the two most important services
that matter most to them:

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:25.346
education benefits
and disability benefits.

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:28.517
I'm proud to say that they are
live on the site today,

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.079
and as the team continues
to streamline more services,

00:13:31.103 --> 00:13:33.954
they will be ported over here,
and the old sites, shut down.

00:13:33.978 --> 00:13:38.344
(Applause)

00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:43.668
To me, this is what change
looks like in 2016.

00:13:44.493 --> 00:13:46.267
When you walk out of the Oval Office,

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.632
the first time I was ever
there, I noticed a quote

00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:50.623
the President had embroidered on the rug.

00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:52.552
It's the classic JFK quote.

00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:56.943
It says, "No problem of human destiny
is beyond human beings."

00:13:57.882 --> 00:13:59.232
It's true.

00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:02.399
We have the tools to solve these problems.

00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:05.708
We have the tools to come together
as a society, as a country,

00:14:05.732 --> 00:14:07.693
and to fix this together.

00:14:08.073 --> 00:14:09.690
Yes, it's hard.

00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:12.137
It's particularly hard
when we have to fight,

00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.215
when we have to refuse to succumb
to the belief that things won't change.

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:18.356
But in my experience,

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.840
it's often the hardest things
that are the most worth doing,

00:14:21.864 --> 00:14:23.669
because if we don't do them,

00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:25.106
who will?

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.138
This is on us,

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:29.058
all of us, together,

00:14:29.082 --> 00:14:32.273
because government is not
an abstract institution or a concept.

00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:35.265
Our government is us.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.039
(Applause)

00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:42.590
Today, it is no longer a question

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:44.518
of if change is possible.

00:14:45.422 --> 00:14:47.359
The question is not, "Can we?"

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.986
The question is, "Will we?"

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.292
Will you?

00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:53.484
Thank you.

00:14:53.508 --> 00:14:57.096
(Applause)

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.310
Thank you.

00:14:58.334 --> 00:15:01.580
(Applause)
