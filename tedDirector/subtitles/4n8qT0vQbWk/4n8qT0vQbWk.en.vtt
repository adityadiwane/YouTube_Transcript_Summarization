00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:16.637
I just met you on a bus,

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.078
and we would really like 
to get to know each other,

00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:21.564
but I've got to get off at the next stop,

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:26.331
so you're going to tell me 
three things about yourself

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:29.911
that just define you as a person,

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.689
three things about yourself

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.298
that will help me understand who you are,

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:39.292
three things that just 
get to your very essence.

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:42.370
And what I'm wondering

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.659
is, of those three things,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.649
is any one of them

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.673
surviving some kind of trauma?

00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:58.370
Cancer survivor, rape survivor,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.487
Holocaust survivor, incest survivor.

00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:06.931
Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.462
by our wounds?

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:13.938
And where I have seen this survivor identity

00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:16.426
have the most consequences

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.979
is in the cancer community.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.713
And I've been around this 
community for a long time,

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:24.907
because I've been a hospice 
and a hospital chaplain

00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:28.204
for almost 30 years.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:33.937
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:36.242
when I received the news that

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:39.677
my mother had breast cancer.

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:41.859
And then five days later,

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.326
I received the news that I had breast cancer.

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:49.959
My mother and I can be competitive —

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.747
(Laughter) —

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:56.179
but I was really not trying to
compete with her on this one.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.204
And in fact, I thought, well,

00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:00.139
if you have to have cancer,

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.860
it's pretty convenient to be working

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.371
at a place that treats it.

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.068
But this is what I heard from 
a lot of outraged people.

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:07.530
What?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.450
You're the chaplain.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.740
You should be immune.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.817
Like, maybe I should have just gotten off

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.112
with a warning instead of an actual ticket,

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.880
because I'm on the force.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.855
So I did get my treatment at the
cancer center where I worked,

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.376
which was amazingly convenient,

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:27.615
and I had chemotherapy

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:30.325
and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:32.450
and so before I say another word,
let me just say right now,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.224
this is the fake one. (Laughter)

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.437
I have found that I need to get that out of the way,

00:02:40.437 --> 00:02:42.211
because I'll see somebody go

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:44.428
"Oh, I know it's this one."

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:46.892
And then I'll move or I'll 
gesture and they'll go,

00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:49.445
"No, it's that one."

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:51.616
So now you know.

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:53.753
I learned a lot being a patient,

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:55.275
and one of the surprising things was

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.382
that only a small part of the cancer experience

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:01.474
is about medicine.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:05.827
Most of it is about feelings and faith

00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:08.460
and losing and finding your identity

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.038
and discovering strength

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:13.960
and flexibility you never even knew you had.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.289
It's about realizing that

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.359
the most important things in life are

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.440
not things at all, but relationships,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.506
and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.945
and learning that the way to
get out of almost anything

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:34.260
is to say, "I have cancer."

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.773
So the other thing I learned was that

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:40.227
I don't have to take on "cancer survivor"

00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:42.195
as my identity,

00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:45.814
but, boy, are there powerful forces

00:03:45.814 --> 00:03:49.360
pushing me to do just that.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.678
Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.

00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:55.637
Cancer organizations

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:57.617
and the drive for early screening

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.271
and cancer awareness and cancer research

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:02.386
have normalized cancer,

00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:03.710
and this is a wonderful thing.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.794
We can now talk about cancer

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:07.572
without whispering.

00:04:07.572 --> 00:04:12.090
We can talk about cancer and
we can support one another.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.176
But sometimes, it feels

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:16.574
like people go a little overboard

00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:21.779
and they start telling us how we're going to feel.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.322
So about a week after my surgery,

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:28.202
we had a houseguest.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.950
That was probably our first mistake.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.471
And keep in mind that

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.141
at this point in my life

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.763
I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,

00:04:37.763 --> 00:04:40.086
and issues like dying and death

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.642
and the meaning of life,

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:44.820
these are all things I'd been 
yakking about forever.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.320
So at dinner that night,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.056
our houseguest proceeds to
stretch his arms up over his head,

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.861
and say, "You know, Deb,

00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:57.010
now you're really going to learn what's important.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.707
Yes, you are going to make some big changes

00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:01.077
in your life,

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:04.725
and now you're going to start
thinking about your death.

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:08.750
Yep, this cancer is your wakeup call."

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.175
Now, these are golden words

00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:15.154
coming from someone who is speaking about

00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:17.573
their own experience,

00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:19.949
but when someone is telling you

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.342
how you are going to feel,

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:24.388
it's instant crap.

00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:27.292
The only reason I did not kill him

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.283
with my bare hands

00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:33.378
was because I could not lift my right arm.

00:05:33.378 --> 00:05:37.596
But I did say a really bad word to him,

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:40.497
followed by a regular word, that —

00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:41.720
(Laughter) —

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.238
made my husband say, "She's on narcotics."

00:05:45.238 --> 00:05:47.196
(Laughter)

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.690
And then after my treatment, it just felt like

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.973
everyone was telling me what my
experience was going to mean.

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:55.765
"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."

00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:57.389
"Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.651
"This means you're going to be wearing

00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:01.042
the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:02.904
and the headband and the earrings

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.640
and the bracelet and the panties."

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.869
Panties. No, seriously, google it.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.920
(Laughter)

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.011
How is that raising awareness?

00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:16.078
Only my husband should be seeing my panties.

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.747
(Laughter)

00:06:17.747 --> 00:06:22.158
He's pretty aware of cancer already.

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:25.302
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.452
this is just taking over my life.

00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:33.424
And that's when I told myself, 
claim your experience.

00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:37.086
Don't let it claim you.

00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:39.194
We all know that

00:06:39.194 --> 00:06:43.316
the way to cope with trauma, with loss,

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:45.741
with any life-changing experience,

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.891
is to find meaning.

00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:50.128
But here's the thing:

00:06:50.128 --> 00:06:51.795
No one can tell us

00:06:51.795 --> 00:06:54.531
what our experience means.

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.820
We have to decide what it means.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.952
And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.959
extroverted meaning.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.470
We don't all have to start a foundation

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.622
or an organization or write a book

00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:09.502
or make a documentary.

00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:12.449
Meaning can be quiet

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:14.620
and introverted.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.548
Maybe we make one small decision about our lives

00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:25.626
that can bring about big change.

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.566
Many years ago, I had a patient,

00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:29.571
just a wonderful young man

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.306
who was loved by the staff,

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:35.190
and so it was something of a shock to us to realize

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.974
that he had no friends.

00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:41.280
He lived by himself,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.308
he would come in for chemotherapy by himself,

00:07:45.308 --> 00:07:47.253
he would receive his treatment,

00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:50.984
and then he'd walk home alone.

00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:52.748
And I even asked him. I said, "Hey,

00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:55.489
how come you never bring a friend with you?"

00:07:55.489 --> 00:08:00.208
And he said, "I don't really have any friends."

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:02.469
But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:06.845
We all loved him, and people were going
in and out of his room all the time.

00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:09.804
So at his last chemo,

00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:11.131
we sang him the song

00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:13.898
and we put the crown on his 
head and we blew the bubbles,

00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:16.339
and then I asked him, I said,

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:20.795
"So what are you going to do now?"

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:22.605
And he answered,

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:24.238
"Make friends."

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.350
And he did.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.904
He started volunteering 
and he made friends there,

00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:32.590
and he began going to a church
and he made friends there,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.550
and at Christmas he invited my husband
and me to a party in his apartment,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.667
and the place was filled with his friends.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:42.910
Claim your experience.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.559
Don't let it claim you.

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:49.431
He decided that the meaning of his experience

00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:53.198
was to know the joy of friendship,

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:57.806
and then learn to make friends.

00:08:57.806 --> 00:09:01.792
So what about you?

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:04.145
How are you going to find meaning

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:06.592
in your crappy experience?

00:09:06.592 --> 00:09:08.483
It could be a recent one,

00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:10.454
or it could be one that you've been carrying around

00:09:10.454 --> 00:09:14.345
for a really long time.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:18.855
It's never too late to change what it means,

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:21.110
because meaning is dynamic.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.771
What it means today

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.698
may not be what it means a year from now,

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:27.541
or 10 years from now.

00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.151
It's never too late to become someone other

00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.672
than simply a survivor.

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:36.996
Hear how static that word sounds?

00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:38.913
Survivor.

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:43.304
No movement, no growth.

00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:45.191
Claim your experience.

00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:47.812
Don't let it claim you, because if you do,

00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:50.973
I believe you will become trapped,

00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:56.915
you will not grow, you will not evolve.

00:09:56.915 --> 00:10:00.393
But of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures

00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:04.764
that cause us to take on that identity of survivor.

00:10:04.764 --> 00:10:08.657
Sometimes we just like the perks.

00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:12.165
Sometimes there's a payoff.

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:15.900
But then we get stuck.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.711
Now, one of the first things I learned

00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:21.817
as a chaplain intern was the three C's

00:10:21.817 --> 00:10:24.208
of the chaplain's job:

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:31.170
Comfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.325
or challenge.

00:10:33.325 --> 00:10:35.271
Now, we all pretty much love the comforting

00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:37.128
and the clarifying.

00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:42.070
The confronting, not so much.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.064
One of the other things that I loved

00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:46.522
about being a chaplain was

00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:50.995
seeing patients a year, or even several years

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:52.836
after their treatment, because

00:10:52.836 --> 00:10:55.536
it was just really cool to see 
how they had changed

00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:57.752
and how their lives had evolved

00:10:57.752 --> 00:10:59.642
and what had happened to them.

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:02.162
So I was thrilled one day

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.610
to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.191
from a patient who I had seen the year before,

00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:10.665
and she was there with her two adult daughters,

00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:14.924
who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.461
So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:20.712
because she had just gotten
all of her test results back

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:26.900
and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.657
Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:37.150
So they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.957
and it was so weird, because

00:11:39.957 --> 00:11:43.839
within two minutes, she 
started retelling me the story

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:48.369
of her diagnosis and her 
surgery and her chemo,

00:11:48.369 --> 00:11:51.837
even though, as her chaplain, 
I saw her every week,

00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:54.728
and so I knew this story.

00:11:54.728 --> 00:11:57.770
And she was using words like suffering,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.765
agony, struggle.

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:04.379
And she ended her story with,

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:09.173
"I felt crucified."

00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:11.837
And at that point, her two 
daughters got up and said,

00:12:11.837 --> 00:12:15.749
"We're going to go get coffee."

00:12:15.749 --> 00:12:18.890
And they left.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.725
Tell me three things about
yourself before the next stop.

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:24.481
People were leaving the bus before she even got

00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:29.858
to number two or number three.

00:12:29.858 --> 00:12:33.345
So I handed her a tissue,

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.642
and I gave her a hug,

00:12:36.642 --> 00:12:40.152
and then, because I really cared for this woman,

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:42.238
I said,

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:44.544
"Get down off your cross."

00:12:44.544 --> 00:12:48.810
And she said, "What?"

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.224
And I repeated, "Get down off your cross."

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:58.869
And to her credit, she could 
talk about her reasons

00:12:58.869 --> 00:13:03.988
for embracing and then clinging to this identity.

00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:06.010
It got her a lot of attention.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.115
People were taking care of her for a change.

00:13:09.115 --> 00:13:12.810
But now, it was having the opposite effect.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.293
It was pushing people away.

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:19.040
People kept leaving to get coffee.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.941
She felt crucified by her experience,

00:13:22.941 --> 00:13:29.163
but she didn't want to let that crucified self die.

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:32.080
Now, perhaps you are thinking

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.030
I was a little harsh with her,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.138
so I must tell you that

00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:40.830
I was speaking out of my own experience.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.674
Many, many years before,

00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:47.000
I had been fired from a job that I loved,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.716
and I would not stop talking about my innocence

00:13:50.716 --> 00:13:54.120
and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.250
until finally, just like this woman,

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.291
people were walking away from me,

00:13:57.291 --> 00:14:00.527
until I finally realized

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:04.399
I wasn't just processing my feelings,

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:07.107
I was feeding them.

00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:11.170
I didn't want to let that crucified self die.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.592
But we all know that with any resurrection story,

00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:19.220
you have to die first.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.043
The Christian story,

00:14:21.043 --> 00:14:24.315
Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb

00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:26.810
before he was resurrected.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.648
And I believe that for us,

00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:30.780
being in the tomb

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.766
means doing our own deep inner work

00:14:34.766 --> 00:14:37.470
around our wounds

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.943
and allowing ourselves to be healed.

00:14:41.943 --> 00:14:45.000
We have to let that crucified self die

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.604
so that a new self, a truer self,

00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:50.986
is born.

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:53.844
We have to let that old story go

00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:57.991
so that a new story, a truer story,

00:14:57.991 --> 00:15:01.030
can be told.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:06.573
Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.154
What if there were no survivors,

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:11.950
meaning, what if people decided

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.820
to just claim their trauma as an experience

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.990
instead of taking it on as an identity?

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.992
Maybe it would be the end of being

00:15:20.992 --> 00:15:23.350
trapped in our wounds

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.904
and the beginning of amazing

00:15:26.904 --> 00:15:30.830
self-exploration and discovery and growth.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.625
Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:38.205
by who we have become

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:42.375
and who we are becoming.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:48.146
So perhaps survivor was not

00:15:48.146 --> 00:15:53.353
one of the three things that you would tell me.

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:54.670
No matter.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.910
I just want you all to know that

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.223
I am really glad that we are on this bus together,

00:16:01.223 --> 00:16:05.119
and this is my stop.

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:08.824
(Applause)
