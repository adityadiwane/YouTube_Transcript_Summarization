00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:14.889
When I wrote my memoir,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.566
the publishers were really confused.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.800
Was it about me as a child refugee,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.304
or as a woman who set up a high-tech
software company back in the 1960s,

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:30.380
one that went public

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.963
and eventually employed over 8,500 people?

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:39.470
Or was it as a mother
of an autistic child?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.925
Or as a philanthropist that's
now given away serious money?

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:46.569
Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.469
So let me tell you my story.

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:58.446
All that I am stems from when
I got onto a train in Vienna,

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:03.483
part of the Kindertransport that saved
nearly 10,000 Jewish children

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:05.851
from Nazi Europe.

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.860
I was five years old, clutching the hand
of my nine-year-old sister

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.813
and had very little idea as to 
what was going on.

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:18.504
"What is England and 
why am I going there?"

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:25.241
I'm only alive because so long ago, 
I was helped by generous strangers.

00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.446
I was lucky, and doubly lucky
to be later reunited

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:32.885
with my birth parents.

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:39.917
But, sadly, I never bonded 
with them again.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.227
But I've done more in the seven decades
since that miserable day 

00:01:43.227 --> 00:01:45.003
when my mother put me on the train

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.290
than I would ever have dreamed possible.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.398
And I love England, my adopted country,

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:56.469
with a passion that perhaps only someone
who has lost their human rights can feel.

00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:04.188
I decided to make mine a life
that was worth saving.

00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:06.449
And then, I just got on with it.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.524
(Laughter)

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:15.465
Let me take you back to the early 1960s.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:19.953
To get past the gender issues of the time,

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:26.443
I set up my own software house at one
of the first such startups in Britain.

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:32.301
But it was also a company of women,
a company for women,

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:35.325
an early social business.

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:39.001
And people laughed at the very idea
because software, at that time,

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.074
was given away free with hardware.

00:02:41.074 --> 00:02:45.808
Nobody would buy software,
certainly not from a woman.

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:51.745
Although women were then coming out
of the universities with decent degrees,

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:55.299
there was a glass ceiling to our progress.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.985
And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,

00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:04.550
and I wanted opportunities for women.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.042
I recruited professionally qualified women
who'd left the industry on marriage,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.293
or when their first child was expected

00:03:11.293 --> 00:03:16.484
and structured them into a
home-working organization.

00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:21.069
We pioneered the concept of women
going back into the workforce

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.611
after a career break.

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:27.394
We pioneered all sorts of
new, flexible work methods:

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:32.646
job shares, profit-sharing, 
and eventually, co-ownership

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:36.092
when I took a quarter of the company
into the hands of the staff

00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:39.912
at no cost to anyone but me.

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:47.773
For years, I was the first woman this,
or the only woman that.

00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:51.539
And in those days, I couldn't work
on the stock exchange,

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.300
I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.193
Indeed, I couldn't open a bank account
without my husband's permission.

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:05.715
My generation of women fought
the battles for the right to work

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:10.207
and the right for equal pay.

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:14.068
Nobody really expected much 
from people at work or in society

00:04:14.068 --> 00:04:16.566
because all the expectations then 

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:20.461
were about home and 
family responsibilities.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.298
And I couldn't really face that,

00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:29.287
so I started to challenge
the conventions of the time,

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:35.142
even to the extent of changing my name
from "Stephanie" to "Steve"

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.891
in my business development letters,

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:39.369
so as to get through the door
before anyone realized

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:40.750
that he was a she.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.054
(Laughter)

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:51.214
My company, called Freelance Programmers,
and that's precisely what it was,

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:56.287
couldn't have started smaller: 
on the dining room table,

00:04:56.287 --> 00:05:01.681
and financed by the equivalent
of 100 dollars in today's terms,

00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:08.978
and financed by my labor and 
by borrowing against the house.

00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:14.615
My interests were scientific, 
the market was commercial --

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.640
things such as payroll,
which I found rather boring.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.752
So I had to compromise with 
operational research work,

00:05:23.752 --> 00:05:27.183
which had the intellectual challenge 
that interested me

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:34.850
and the commercial value 
that was valued by the clients:

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.108
things like scheduling freight trains,

00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:46.297
time-tabling buses, stock control,
lots and lots of stock control.

00:05:46.297 --> 00:05:50.545
And eventually, the work came in.

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:54.300
We disguised the domestic and
part-time nature of the staff

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.440
by offering fixed prices,
one of the very first to do so.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.755
And who would have guessed
that the programming

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:06.699
of the black box flight recorder 
of Supersonic Concord

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.908
would have been done by a bunch 
of women working in their own homes.

00:06:11.908 --> 00:06:18.682
(Applause)

00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:24.323
All we used was a simple 
"trust the staff" approach

00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:26.504
and a simple telephone.

00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:32.225
We even used to ask job applicants, 
"Do you have access to a telephone?"

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:37.194
An early project was to develop
software standards

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:39.434
on management control protocols.

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:45.636
And software was and still is a
maddeningly hard-to-control activity,

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:47.747
so that was enormously valuable.

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:49.971
We used the standards ourselves,

00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:52.989
we were even paid to update 
them over the years,

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:57.253
and eventually, they were adopted by NATO.

00:06:58.323 --> 00:07:02.450
Our programmers -- remember, only women,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.896
including gay and transgender --

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:10.939
worked with pencil and paper
to develop flowcharts

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.596
defining each task to be done.

00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:18.509
And they then wrote code, 
usually machine code,

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.776
sometimes binary code,

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:25.506
which was then sent
by mail to a data center

00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:29.724
to be punched onto
paper tape or card

00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:34.051
and then re-punched, 
in order to verify it.

00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:37.387
All this, before it ever got
near a computer.

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:42.046
That was programming in the early 1960s.

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:48.701
In 1975, 13 years from startup,

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.912
equal opportunity legislation 
came in in Britain

00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:58.824
and that made it illegal to have 
our pro-female policies.

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:02.400
And as an example of 
unintended consequences,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.072
my female company had to let the men in.

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:11.014
(Laughter)

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:13.418
When I started my company of women,

00:08:13.418 --> 00:08:20.317
the men said, "How interesting, because
it only works because it's small."

00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:26.136
And later, as it became sizable, 
they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:29.355
but of no strategic interest."

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:37.274
And later, when it was a company
valued at over three billion dollars,

00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:41.877
and I'd made 70 of the staff 
into millionaires,

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:45.397
they sort of said, "Well done, Steve!"

00:08:45.397 --> 00:08:49.683
(Laughter)

00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:53.969
(Applause)

00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:58.255
You can always tell ambitious women
by the shape of our heads:

00:08:58.255 --> 00:09:01.580
They're flat on top for being 
patted patronizingly.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:07.521
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:12.084
And we have larger feet to stand
away from the kitchen sink.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.737
(Laughter)

00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:17.562
Let me share with you 
two secrets of success:

00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:23.781
Surround yourself with first-class people
and people that you like;

00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:30.065
and choose your partner
very, very carefully.

00:09:30.065 --> 00:09:33.278
Because the other day when I said, 
"My husband's an angel,"

00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:35.764
a woman complained --
"You're lucky," she said,

00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:37.790
"mine's still alive."

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.807
(Laughter)

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:50.174
If success were easy, 
we'd all be millionaires.

00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:58.048
But in my case, it came in the midst
of family trauma and indeed, crisis.

00:10:01.258 --> 00:10:09.532
Our late son, Giles, was an only child,
a beautiful, contented baby.

00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:13.465
And then, at two and a half,

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:16.738
like a changeling in a fairy story,

00:10:16.738 --> 00:10:20.170
he lost the little speech that he had

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:25.442
and turned into a wild, 
unmanageable toddler.

00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:27.524
Not the terrible twos;

00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:33.457
he was profoundly autistic 
and he never spoke again.

00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:41.734
Giles was the first resident in the first
house of the first charity that I set up

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:45.304
to pioneer services for autism.

00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:48.304
And then there's been
a groundbreaking Prior's Court school

00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:50.724
for pupils with autism

00:10:50.724 --> 00:10:54.844
and a medical research charity,
again, all for autism.

00:10:54.844 --> 00:10:59.823
Because whenever I found a gap
in services, I tried to help.

00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:06.583
I like doing new things 
and making new things happen.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:13.159
And I've just started a three-year 
think tank for autism.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:18.434
And so that some of my wealth does go back
to the industry from which it stems,

00:11:18.434 --> 00:11:22.017
I've also founded 
the Oxford Internet Institute

00:11:22.017 --> 00:11:24.510
and other IT ventures.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.795
The Oxford Internet Institute
focuses not on the technology,

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:33.607
but on the social, economic, legal
and ethical issues of the Internet.

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:42.909
Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.

00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:46.689
And I have learned to live without him,

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:51.469
and I have learned to live 
without his need of me.

00:11:51.469 --> 00:11:54.829
Philanthropy is all that I do now.

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:57.188
I need never worry about getting lost

00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:00.697
because several charities
would quickly come and find me.

00:12:00.697 --> 00:12:04.667
(Laughter)

00:12:12.807 --> 00:12:16.885
It's one thing to have an idea 
for an enterprise,

00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:19.112
but as many people in this room will know,

00:12:19.112 --> 00:12:22.025
making it happen is a very difficult thing

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:30.117
and it demands extraordinary energy,
self-belief and determination,

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:34.322
the courage to risk family and home,

00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:39.491
and a 24/7 commitment 
that borders on the obsessive.

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:43.475
So it's just as well
that I'm a workaholic.

00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:48.706
I believe in the beauty of work when we
do it properly and in humility.

00:12:50.153 --> 00:12:55.522
Work is not just something I do
when I'd rather be doing something else.

00:12:57.612 --> 00:12:59.756
We live our lives forward.

00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:02.990
So what has all that taught me?

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.846
I learned that tomorrow's 
never going to be like today,

00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:10.899
and certainly nothing like yesterday.

00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:14.306
And that made me able to cope with change,

00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:18.634
indeed, eventually to welcome change,

00:13:18.634 --> 00:13:23.666
though I'm told I'm still very difficult.

00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:25.801
Thank you very much.

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:33.081
(Applause)
