00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I was raised in Seoul, Korea,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
I was pre-med at the time,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and I thought I would become a surgeon

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
because I was interested in anatomy

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.160
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
as a living organism.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
I wanted to dissect it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
and look into its unseen layers.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
And the way to it, for me,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
was through artistic means.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.160
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
and in grad school I became interested

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
But I took a liking to them

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
because they dwell on the fringes of society.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
they're also considered pests.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.160
I also started looking around in the city

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
and trying to photograph them.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
hoping to catch a rat or two,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
and a man came up to me and said,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
"You can't take photographs here.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
The MTA will confiscate your camera."

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
I was quite shocked by that,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
I'll follow the rats."

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Then I started going into the tunnels,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
guerrilla historians, etc.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160
of people who regularly explore urban ruins

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
such as abandoned subway stations,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
When I took photographs in these locations,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
I felt there was something missing in the pictures.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.160
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
wasn't enough for me.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
So I wanted to create a fictional character

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and the simplest way to do it, at the time,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
was to model myself.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.160
I decided against clothing

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.160
because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
or time-specific elements.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.160
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
It's now an empty, six-acre lot

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.160
waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
I was very fond of this space

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160
because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
that is abandoned.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
When I first went in, I was scared,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.160
because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.160
But they happened to be wild dogs living there,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160
and it was right by the water,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
so there were swans and ducks swimming around

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and trees growing everywhere

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
to become a part of that nature.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
When I got comfortable in the space,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
it also felt like a big playground.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
as if I went back in time and became a child again.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160
which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
The construction began in 1837.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
It lasted about five years.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160
When you go into spaces like this,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
you're directly accessing the past,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
because they sit untouched for decades.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.160
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and shimmying up and down narrow cracks

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
and getting wet and muddy

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160
and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.160
The murals were done by a graffiti artist

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.160
when the tunnel reopened for trains.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
There's nobody around you,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.160
and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.160
completely unaware of what's underneath.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
When I was going out a lot to these places,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
because I was in a solitary phase in my life,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.160
and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
which references Charles Baudelaire.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
This is the same tunnel.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
and the train approaching.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
I was there alone, setting up,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
and a homeless man approached.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.160
I was basically intruding in his living space.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
I was really frightened at first,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
and he didn't seem to mind

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
and ran back and forth.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
to wipe off my feet

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
and kindly walked me out.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
It must have been a very unusual day for him.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
(Laughter)

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
One thing that struck me, after this incident,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.160
was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
That homeless man, to me, really represented

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
an element of the unconscious of the city.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.160
He told me that he was abused above ground

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
and was once in Riker's Island,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160
and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.160
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.160
who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.160
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
The tunnels are famous for having been used

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
during the development of the Manhattan Project.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160
This particular tunnel is interesting

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160
because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
which was demolished in 1890

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
when Columbia moved in.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
This is the New York City Farm Colony,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.160
which was a poorhouse in Staten Island

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.160
from the 1890s to the 1930s.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
Most of my photos are set in places

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
that have been abandoned for decades,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
but this is an exception.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
This children's hospital was closed in 1997;

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.160
it's located in Newark.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
When I was there three years ago,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160
the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
but everything was left there as it was.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
and even used utensils,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160
which you see on the autopsy table.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.160
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.160
any man-made structures around you.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.160
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
and how vulnerable people truly are.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
I love to travel,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
It's full of history,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
and also full of underground bunkers

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
and ruins from the war.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
This was taken under a homeless asylum

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
I saw the structure while I was on the train,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160
and I got off at the next station and met people there

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.160
which was used for ammunition storage during the war

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160
and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
I explored there extensively

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
in the off-limits areas

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
and fell in love right away.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.160
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160
and by the 18th century,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160
so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.160
and dug new observation tunnels

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.160
in order to monitor and map the whole place.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.160
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
And at the same time,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.160
there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.160
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.160
making them into the catacombs.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
The remains of over six million people are housed in there,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
some over 1,300 years old.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.160
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
where most of the ossuaries are located.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.160
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
and many bunkers from the World War II era.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
This is a German bunker.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
Nearby there's a French bunker,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160
and the whole tunnel system is so complex

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160
that the two parties never met.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.160
which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.160
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.160
After exploring the underground of Paris,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.160
I decided to climb up,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.160
and I climbed a Gothic monument

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
that's right in the middle of Paris.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.160
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.160
It was built in the early 1500s.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.160
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter)

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
And all this time,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
I never saw a single rat in any of these places,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.160
until recently, when I was in the London sewers.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
This was probably the toughest place to explore.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
I guess, except for in this picture.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.160
And when the tides of waste matter come in

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.160
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.160
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
And this is the first theater project I worked on.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.160
It was performed last September one time only

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160
which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
built in 1844.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.160
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.160
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160
The last place I visited

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.160
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.160
in order to preserve their memories in a creative way --

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
before they're lost forever.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160
Thank you.
