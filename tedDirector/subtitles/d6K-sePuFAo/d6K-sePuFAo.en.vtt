Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago,
I got a call from a woman in Texas,

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.354
Stacey Baker,

00:00:18.354 --> 00:00:22.116
and she'd seen some of my photographs
in an art exhibition

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:26.852
and was wondering if she could commission
me to take a portrait of her parents.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:31.335
Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey,
and I thought this was some sort of

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.367
wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.242
but it was only later that I found out

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.449
she'd actually taken out a loan
to make this happen.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.076
I took the picture of her parents,

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.074
but I was actually more excited
about photographing Stacey.

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:48.832
The picture I made that day

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:51.946
ended up becoming
one of my best-known portraits.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.031
At the time I made this picture,
Stacey was working as an attorney

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:58.686
for the State of Texas.

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:03.386
Not long after, she left her job
to study photography in Maine,

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.651
and while she was there,
she ended up meeting

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.786
the director of photography
at the New York Times Magazine

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:12.153
and was actually offered a job.

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:14.982
Stacey Baker: In the years since,
Alec and I have done

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:17.214
a number of magazine projects together,

00:01:17.214 --> 00:01:19.165
and we've become friends.

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:23.948
A few months ago, I started talking
to Alec about a fascination of mine.

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:27.338
I've always been obsessed
with how couples meet.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:30.310
I asked Alec how he
and his wife Rachel met,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.166
and he told me the story
of a high school football game

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:36.091
where she was 16 and he was 15,

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.181
and he asked her out.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.015
He liked her purple hair.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:43.173
She said yes, and that was it.

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:47.469
I then asked Alec if he'd be interested
in doing a photography project

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.280
exploring this question.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.320
AS: And I was interested in the question,
but I was actually much more interested

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.796
in Stacey's motivation for asking it,

00:01:56.796 --> 00:02:00.727
particularly since I'd never known
Stacey to have a boyfriend.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:03.513
So as part of this project,
I thought it'd be interesting

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.626
if she tried to meet someone.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:10.471
So my idea was to have Stacey here
go speed dating

00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:14.542
in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:20.463
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:25.664
SB: We ended up at what was advertised
as the world's largest speed dating event.

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:27.684
I had 19 dates

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.679
and each date lasted three minutes.

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.616
Participants were given a list of ice-
breaker questions to get the ball rolling,

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:38.563
things like, "If you could be any kind
of animal, what would you be?"

00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:40.444
That sort of thing.

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:42.858
My first date was Colin.

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.669
He's from England,

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.824
and he once married a woman he met
after placing an ad for a Capricorn.

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:52.169
Alec and I saw him
at the end of the evening,

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.092
and he said he'd kissed a woman in line
at one of the concession stands.

00:02:57.092 --> 00:03:00.398
Zack and Chris came
to the date-a-thon together.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:05.239
This is Carl.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.663
I asked Carl, "What's the first thing
you notice about a woman?"

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:12.753
He said, "Tits."

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:15.190
(Laughter)

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.554
Matthew is attracted to women
with muscular calves.

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:24.385
We talked about running. He does
triathlons, I run half-marathons.

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:29.238
Alec actually liked his eyes and asked
if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:32.219
and I don't think he was
attracted to me either.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.715
Austin and Mike came together.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.338
Mike asked me a hypothetical question.

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:43.959
He said, "You're in an elevator
running late for a meeting.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.397
Someone makes a dash for the elevator.

00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:49.346
Do you hold it open for them?"

00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:51.343
And I said I would not.

00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.926
(Laughter)

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:59.818
Cliff said the first thing he notices
about a woman is her teeth,

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:02.813
and we complimented each other's teeth.

00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:05.181
Because he's an open mouth sleeper,

00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:09.384
he says he has to floss more
to help prevent gum disease,

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.799
and so I asked him how often he flosses,

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.399
and he said, "Every other day."

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.214
(Laughter)

00:04:17.534 --> 00:04:19.972
Now, as someone who flosses twice a day,

00:04:19.972 --> 00:04:22.372
I wasn't really sure that
that was flossing more

00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:24.894
but I don't think I said that out loud.

00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:27.936
Bill is an auditor,

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:33.419
and we talked the entire three minutes
about auditing. (Laughter)

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.640
The first thing Spencer notices
about a woman is her complexion.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.333
He feels a lot of women
wear too much makeup,

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.164
and that they should only wear enough
to accentuate the features that they have.

00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:47.231
I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all

00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.249
and he seemed to think
that that was a good thing.

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:55.404
Craig told me he didn't think
I was willing to be vulnerable.

00:04:55.404 --> 00:05:00.466
He was also frustrated when I couldn't
remember my most embarrassing moment.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.768
He thought I was lying, but I wasn't.

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.852
I didn't think he liked me at all,
but at the end of the night,

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:09.173
he came back to me and he gave me
a box of chocolates.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:12.540
William was really difficult to talk to.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.676
I think he was drunk.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:17.111
(Laughter)

00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:20.875
Actor Chris McKenna
was the MC of the event.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.336
He used to be on
"The Young and the Restless."

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:26.076
I didn't actually go on a date with him.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:29.621
Alec said he saw several women
give their phone numbers to him.

00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:35.620
Needless to say, I didn't fall in love.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.614
I didn't feel a particular connection with
any of the men that I went on dates with,

00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:44.262
and I didn't feel like they felt
a particular connection with me either.

00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:48.043
AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --

00:05:48.043 --> 00:05:53.626
(Laughter) -- as a photographer
is the quality of vulnerability.

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:57.330
The physical exterior reveals a crack
in which you can get a glimpse

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.511
at a more fragile interior.

00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:03.878
At this date-a-thon event,
I saw so many examples of that,

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:08.499
but as I watched Stacey's dates
and talked to her about them,

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:14.512
I realized how different
photographic love is from real love.

00:06:14.512 --> 00:06:18.162
What is real love? How does it work?

00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:22.504
In order to work on this question
and to figure out how someone goes

00:06:22.504 --> 00:06:27.078
from meeting on a date
to having a life together,

00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:29.632
Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,

00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:33.769
which is the largest
retirement community in Las Vegas.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.638
Our contact there was George,
who runs the community's photography club.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.447
He arranged for us to meet other couples
in their makeshift photo studio.

00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:49.515
SB: After 45 years of marriage,
Anastasia's husband died two years ago,

00:06:49.515 --> 00:06:52.667
so we asked if she had
an old wedding picture.

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:56.080
She met her husband
when she was a 15-year-old waitress

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.565
at a small barbecue place in Michigan.

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:00.237
He was 30.

00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:02.512
She'd lied about her age.

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:05.321
He was the first person she'd dated.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.780
Dean had been named photographer of
the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.660
and this caught Alec's attention,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.238
as did the fact 
that he met his wife, Judy,

00:07:14.238 --> 00:07:17.767
at the same age when Alec met Rachel.

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:20.739
Dean admitted that he likes
to look at beautiful women,

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:24.686
but he's never questioned
his decision to marry Judy.

00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:27.054
AS: George met Josephine
at a parish dance.

00:07:27.054 --> 00:07:29.562
He was 18, she was 15.

00:07:29.562 --> 00:07:33.115
Like a lot of the couples we met,
they weren't especially philosophical

00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:35.460
about their early choices.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.041
George said something
that really stuck with me.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:43.565
He said, "When you get that feeling,
you just go with it."

00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:49.675
Bob and Trudy met on a blind date
when she was still in high school.

00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:52.445
They said they weren't particularly
attracted to each other

00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:53.865
when the first met.

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:56.543
Nevertheless, they were
married soon after.

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:59.528
SB: The story that stayed with me the most

00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:04.265
was that of George, the photography club
president, and his wife, Mary.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:07.655
This was George and Mary's
second marriage.

00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:12.345
They met at a country-western club
in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.

00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:16.083
He was there alone drinking
and she was with friends.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:21.795
When they started dating,
he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:24.326
and she offered to help him
get out of debt,

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:28.296
so for the next year, he turned
his paychecks over to Mary,

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:30.804
and she got him out of debt.

00:08:30.804 --> 00:08:35.239
George was actually an alcoholic
when they married, and Mary knew it.

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:38.072
At some point in their marriage,
he says he consumed

00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:41.601
54 beers in one day.

00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:44.434
Another time, when he was drunk,
he threatened to kill Mary

00:08:44.434 --> 00:08:45.966
and her two kids,

00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:50.412
but they escaped and a SWAT team
was called to the house.

00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:52.583
Amazingly, Mary took him back,

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.905
and eventually things got better.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:57.761
George has been involved
in Alcoholics Anonymous

00:08:57.761 --> 00:09:00.664
and hasn't had a drink in 36 years.

00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:01.778
(Music)

00:09:01.778 --> 00:09:04.125
At the end of the day,
after we left Sun City,

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:06.539
I told Alec that I didn't actually think

00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:10.672
that the stories of how these couples met
were all that interesting.

00:09:10.672 --> 00:09:12.878
What was more interesting

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:16.593
was how they managed to stay together.

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:20.773
AS: They all had this beautiful
quality of endurance,

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:23.048
but that was true of the singles, too.

00:09:23.048 --> 00:09:26.856
The world is hard,
and the singles were out there

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:29.201
trying to connect with other people,

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.825
and the couples
were holding onto each other

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:33.592
after all these decades.

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:39.151
My favorite pictures on this trip
were of Joe and Roseanne.

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.395
Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:46.906
we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
if they had an old wedding photograph.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:51.712
In their case, they simultaneously
pulled out of their wallets

00:09:51.712 --> 00:09:56.008
the exact same photograph.

00:09:56.008 --> 00:09:59.142
What's more beautiful,
I thought to myself,

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:03.438
this image of a young couple
who has just fallen in love

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:08.644
or the idea of these two people
holding onto this image for decades?

00:10:10.264 --> 00:10:12.122
Thank you.

00:10:12.122 --> 00:10:17.532
(Applause)
