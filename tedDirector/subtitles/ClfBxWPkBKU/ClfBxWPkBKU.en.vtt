00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.534
So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:20.819
and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.692
because the average bank robbery nets

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:26.230
only 7,500 dollars.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.200
Rank amateurs who know nothing

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.539
about how to cook the books.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.599
The folks who know, of course,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.390
run our largest banks,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.908
and in the last go-around,

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:41.144
they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.561
That's what 11 trillion looks like.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.108
That's how many zeros?

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:48.544
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:51.195
So our task is to educate ourselves

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:52.403
so that we can understand

00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:54.853
why we have these recurrent,

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:56.930
intensifying financial crises,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.125
and how we can prevent them in the future.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.515
And the answer to that is

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:06.921
that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.870
Control fraud is what happens

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.690
when the people who control,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.415
typically a CEO,

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.988
a seemingly legitimate entity,

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:17.244
use it as a weapon to defraud.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.839
And these are the weapons of mass destruction

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:22.939
in the financial world.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.669
They also follow in finance a particular strategy,

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:30.041
because the weapon of choice in finance

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.511
is accounting,

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.405
and there is a recipe for accounting

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:37.735
control fraud, and how it occurs.

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:39.368
And we discovered this recipe

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:42.062
in quite an odd way that I'll
come back to in a moment.

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:46.039
First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.077
second, by making or buying really crappy loans,

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.560
but loans that are made at a very high interest rate

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.038
or yield;

00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:58.270
three, while employing extreme leverage --

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.985
that just means a lot of debt --

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.219
compared to your equity;

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.239
and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.423
against the inevitable losses.

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:11.089
If you follow those four simple steps,

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.390
and any bank can follow them,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.898
then you are mathematically guaranteed

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:18.088
to have three things occur.

00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:19.648
The first thing is

00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:23.012
you will report record bank profits --

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:25.523
not just high, record.

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:30.780
Two, the CEO will immediately
be made incredibly wealthy

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.676
by modern executive compensation.

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:36.546
And three, farther down the road,

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:39.607
the bank will suffer catastrophic losses

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:42.803
and will fail unless it is bailed out.

00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:46.543
And that's a hint as to how

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:48.279
we discovered this recipe,

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.355
because we discovered it
through an autopsy process.

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:57.267
During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.722
we looked at every single failure,

00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:02.139
and we looked for common characteristics,

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.398
and we discovered this recipe was common

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:08.712
to each of these frauds.

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:11.790
In other words, a coroner could find these things

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.650
because this is a fatal recipe

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.074
that will destroy the banks

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:18.165
as well as the economy.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.678
And it also turns out to be precisely

00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:23.940
what could have stopped this crisis,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.462
the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:28.398
just in the household sector,

00:03:28.398 --> 00:03:30.502
that cost us 10 million jobs,

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.956
was the easiest financial crisis by far

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.427
to have avoided completely

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.499
if we had simply learned the lessons

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.604
of epidemics of control fraud,

00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:43.095
particularly using this recipe.

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.002
So let's go to this crisis,

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:47.851
and the two huge epidemics

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:51.515
of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --

00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:54.348
appraisal fraud and liar's loans --

00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:55.793
and what we're going to see

00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:58.140
in looking at both of these is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.393
we got warnings that were incredibly early

00:04:01.393 --> 00:04:03.362
about these frauds.

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:07.500
We got warnings that we could
have taken advantage of easily,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.970
because back in the savings and loan debacle,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.590
we had figured out how to respond

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.668
and prevent these crises.

00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:17.972
And three, the warnings were unambiguous.

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:20.541
They were obvious that what was going on

00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:25.420
was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.193
Let's take appraisal fraud first.

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:29.901
This is simply where you inflate the value

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:32.630
of the home that is being pledged

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.227
as security for the loan.

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:38.733
In 2000, the year 2000,

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:43.067
that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:47.303
the honest appraisers got together a formal petition

00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:50.405
begging the federal government to act,

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.260
and the industry to act,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.069
to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.373
And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:03.010
that banks were demanding that appraisers

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.920
inflate the appraisal,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.221
and that if the appraisers refused to do so,

00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:12.077
they, the banks, would blacklist

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:14.299
honest appraisers

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:16.851
and refuse to use them.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:19.413
Now, we've seen this before

00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:20.941
in the savings and loan debacle,

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.765
and we know that this kind of fraud

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:25.361
can only originate from the lenders,

00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.405
and that no honest lender would ever inflate

00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:29.714
the appraisal,

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:32.810
because it's the great protection against loss.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.441
So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.

00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:38.622
It was something we'd seen before,

00:05:38.622 --> 00:05:40.861
and it was completely unambiguous.

00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.253
This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud

00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:45.850
led by the banks.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.523
What about liar's loans?

00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:51.372
Well, that warning actually comes earlier.

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:54.001
The savings and loan debacle is basically

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.548
the early 1980s through 1993,

00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:00.303
and in the midst of fighting that wave

00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:02.970
of accounting control fraud,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.158
in 1990, we found that a second front

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.203
of fraud was being started.

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:11.358
And like all good financial frauds in America,

00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:15.210
it began in Orange County, California.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.221
And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.

00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:20.010
And our examiners said,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.365
they are making loans without even checking

00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:25.868
what the borrower's income is.

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:30.451
This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,

00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:34.083
and it only makes sense for entities engaged

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:36.324
in these accounting control frauds.

00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:38.595
And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:41.893
and we drove those liar's loans

00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:46.337
out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:48.389
but we could only deal with the industry

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.438
we had jurisdiction over,

00:06:50.438 --> 00:06:52.143
which was savings and loans,

00:06:52.143 --> 00:06:55.523
and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,

00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:58.429
Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.298
its federal savings and loan charter,

00:07:01.298 --> 00:07:03.741
gave up federal deposit insurance,

00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.000
converted to become a mortgage bank

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.200
for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.773
and changed its name to Ameriquest,

00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:13.445
and became the most notorious

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:17.070
of the liar's loans frauds early on,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.606
and to add to that,

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:23.826
they deliberately predated upon minorities.

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:27.917
So we knew again about this crisis.

00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:31.151
We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.341
We had incredibly early warnings of it,

00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.193
and it was absolutely unambiguous

00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:40.399
that no honest lender would
make loans in this fashion.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.241
So let's take a look at the reaction

00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:46.187
of the industry and the regulators

00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:48.990
and the prosecutors to these clear

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.457
early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.

00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:55.306
Start with the industry.

00:07:55.306 --> 00:08:01.260
The industry responded between 2003 and 2006

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.101
by increasing liar's loans

00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:09.333
by over 500 percent.

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.228
These were the loans

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:12.983
that hyperinflated the bubble

00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:16.631
and produced the economic crisis.

00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:21.482
By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime

00:08:21.482 --> 00:08:23.508
were also liar's loans.

00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:26.793
They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,

00:08:26.793 --> 00:08:29.233
they're the most toxic combination

00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:31.093
you can possibly imagine.

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:34.847
By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.464
made that year, all the home loans made that year,

00:08:37.464 --> 00:08:40.186
were liar's loans,

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.497
40 percent.

00:08:41.497 --> 00:08:44.201
And this is despite a warning

00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:47.624
from the industry's own antifraud experts

00:08:47.624 --> 00:08:50.779
that said that these loans were an open invitation

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:52.739
to fraudsters,

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.481
and that they had a fraud incidence

00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:56.969
of 90 percent,

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.661
nine zero.

00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:02.728
In response to that, the industry

00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:07.776
first started calling these loans liar's loans,

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:11.345
which lacks a certain subtlety,

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:14.395
and second, massively increased them,

00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:17.656
and no government regulator ever

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:21.346
required or encouraged any lender

00:09:21.346 --> 00:09:22.642
to make a liar's loan

00:09:22.642 --> 00:09:25.329
or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:28.499
and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:30.621
This came from the lenders

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:33.790
because of the fraud recipe.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.224
What happened to appraisal fraud?

00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:39.360
It expanded remarkably as well.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.757
By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,

00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:46.458
90 percent of appraisers reported

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:48.898
that they had been subject to coercion

00:09:48.898 --> 00:09:51.390
from the lenders trying to get them

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.960
to inflate an appraisal.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.950
In other words, both forms of fraud

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.724
became absolutely endemic and normal,

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.953
and this is what drove the bubble.

00:10:01.953 --> 00:10:04.145
What happened in the governmental sector?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.749
Well, the government, as I told you,

00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:09.465
when we were the savings and loan regulators,

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:12.143
we could only deal with our industry,

00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:14.581
and if people gave up their
federal deposit insurance,

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.844
we couldn't do anything to them.

00:10:16.844 --> 00:10:20.173
Congress, it may strike you as impossible,

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:23.421
but actually did something intelligent in 1994,

00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:26.974
and passed the Home Ownership
and Equity Protection Act

00:10:26.974 --> 00:10:30.227
that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,

00:10:30.227 --> 00:10:34.254
the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans

00:10:34.254 --> 00:10:36.360
by every lender,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.358
whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.

00:10:39.358 --> 00:10:42.893
So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:44.860
as chairs of the Fed, do

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.766
when they got these warnings

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:49.776
that these were massively fraudulent loans

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:53.130
and that they were being sold
to the secondary market?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.350
Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.398
Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,

00:10:57.398 --> 00:10:59.710
it can only be sold to the secondary market

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.906
through more frauds,

00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:03.454
lying about the reps and warrantees,

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.062
and then those people are going to produce

00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:06.490
mortgage-backed securities

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.758
and exotic derivatives

00:11:07.758 --> 00:11:10.980
which are also going to be supposedly backed

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.703
by those fraudulent loans.

00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:14.244
So the fraud is going to progress

00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:15.708
through the entire system,

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.961
hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:22.262
And remember, we had experience with this.

00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:24.550
We had seen significant losses,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.996
and we had experience of competent regulators

00:11:27.996 --> 00:11:29.486
in stopping it.

00:11:29.486 --> 00:11:32.382
Greenspan and Bernanke refused

00:11:32.382 --> 00:11:34.793
to use the authority under the statute

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:37.110
to stop liar's loans.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.674
And this was a matter first of dogma.

00:11:39.674 --> 00:11:42.525
They're just horrifically opposed

00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:44.344
to anything regulatory.

00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:49.060
But it is also the international competition in laxity,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.344
the race to the bottom

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:54.379
between the United States and the United Kingdom,

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:55.980
the city of London, in particular,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.950
and the city of London won that race to the bottom,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.802
but it meant that all regulation in the West

00:12:02.802 --> 00:12:04.806
was completely degraded

00:12:04.806 --> 00:12:06.890
in this stupid competition to be

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.962
who could have the weakest regulation.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.012
So that was the regulatory response.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:14.669
What about the response of the prosecutors

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:16.404
after the crisis,

00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:20.602
after 11 trillion dollars in losses,

00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:22.642
after 10 million jobs lost,

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:25.926
a crisis in which the losses and the frauds

00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:29.381
were more than 70 times larger

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.685
than the savings and loan debacle?

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.576
Well, in the savings and loan debacle,

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:37.546
our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,

00:12:37.546 --> 00:12:41.630
made over 30,000 criminal referrals,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.266
produced over 1,000 felony convictions

00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:46.940
just in cases designated as major,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.078
and that understates the degree of prioritization,

00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:51.874
because we worked with the FBI

00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:56.138
to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,

00:12:56.138 --> 00:12:59.402
the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.

00:12:59.402 --> 00:13:02.186
Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,

00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:05.500
roughly 600 senior officials.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.840
Virtually all of them were prosecuted.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.671
We had a 90 percent conviction rate.

00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:12.501
It's the greatest success against

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:15.103
elite white collar criminals ever,

00:13:15.103 --> 00:13:17.339
and it was because of this understanding

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.674
of control fraud

00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:21.185
and the accounting control fraud mechanism.

00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:24.357
Flash forward to the current crisis.

00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:26.930
The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.560
which was supposed to regulate

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.657
many of the largest makers of liar's loans

00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:31.764
in the country,

00:13:31.764 --> 00:13:36.458
has made, even today -- it no longer exists,

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:38.266
but as of a year ago,

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:43.110
it had made zero criminal referrals.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.806
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,

00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:47.322
which is supposed to regulate
the largest national banks,

00:13:47.322 --> 00:13:49.873
has made zero criminal referrals.

00:13:49.873 --> 00:13:51.499
The Fed appears to have made

00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:53.494
zero criminal referrals.

00:13:53.494 --> 00:13:55.449
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:59.983
is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.

00:13:59.983 --> 00:14:05.518
Without any guidance from the regulators,

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:08.400
there's no expertise in the FBI

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.872
to investigate complex frauds.

00:14:10.872 --> 00:14:12.804
It isn't simply that they've had

00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:14.626
to reinvent the wheel

00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:16.544
of how to do these prosecutions;

00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:21.300
they've forgotten that the wheel exists,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.398
and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:28.000
and of course, zero convictions,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.790
of any of the elite bank frauds,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.327
the Wall Street types,

00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:35.459
that drove this crisis.

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.696
With no expertise coming from the regulators,

00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:40.787
the FBI formed what it calls a partnership

00:14:40.787 --> 00:14:45.110
with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.943
The Mortgage Bankers Association

00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:50.694
is the trade association of the perps.

00:14:50.694 --> 00:14:53.110
And the Mortgage Bankers Association

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.900
set out, it had the audacity and the success

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.578
to con the FBI.

00:14:58.578 --> 00:15:01.655
It had created a supposed definition

00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:04.530
of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.392
its members are always the victim

00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:08.409
and never the perpetrators.

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:12.923
And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,

00:15:12.923 --> 00:15:17.004
rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.

00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:20.060
And so the FBI,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.158
under the leadership of an attorney general

00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:24.332
who is African-American

00:15:24.332 --> 00:15:26.794
and a president of the United
States who is African-American,

00:15:26.794 --> 00:15:30.294
have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,

00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:33.776
in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,

00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:37.454
conceived without sin in the executive ranks.

00:15:37.454 --> 00:15:40.850
And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.068
who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.452
who lack any financial sophistication.

00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:49.810
It is the silliest story you can conceive of,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.711
and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,

00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:57.890
and they leave the banksters alone entirely.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.800
And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.010
the FBI is chasing mice.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.440
What do we need to do?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.944
What can we do in all of this?

00:16:07.944 --> 00:16:11.763
We need to change the perverse incentive structures

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:14.759
that produce these recurrent epidemics

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:16.088
of accounting control fraud

00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:18.102
that are driving our crises.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.990
So we have to first get rid

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.478
of the systemically dangerous institutions.

00:16:23.478 --> 00:16:26.963
These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.

00:16:26.963 --> 00:16:29.105
We need to shrink them to the point,

00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:30.700
within the next five years,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.435
that they no longer pose a systemic risk.

00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:35.572
Right now, they are ticking time bombs

00:16:35.572 --> 00:16:38.915
that will cause a global crisis

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.264
as soon as the next one fails --

00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:43.060
not if, when.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.971
Second thing we need to do is completely reform

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.963
modern executive and professional compensation,

00:16:48.963 --> 00:16:53.306
which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.

00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:55.194
Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers

00:16:55.194 --> 00:16:56.976
through the compensation system,

00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:59.638
trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:02.217
in which bad ethics drives good ethics

00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:03.583
out of the marketplace.

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:05.519
And they largely succeeded,

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:08.402
which is how the fraud became endemic.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:11.100
And the third thing that we need to do

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.738
is deal with what we call the three D's:

00:17:13.738 --> 00:17:16.319
deregulation, desupervision,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.340
and the de facto decriminalization.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.437
Because we can make

00:17:22.437 --> 00:17:26.111
all three of these changes, and if we do so,

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.920
we can dramatically reduce

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.112
how often we have a crisis

00:17:31.112 --> 00:17:34.739
and how severe those crises are.

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:37.720
That is not simply critical to our economy.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.146
You can see what these crises do to inequality

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:43.466
and what they do to our democracy.

00:17:43.466 --> 00:17:46.210
They have produced crony capitalism,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.592
American-style,

00:17:47.592 --> 00:17:50.870
in which the largest financial institutions

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.514
are the leading financial donors of both parties,

00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:56.434
and that's the reason why

00:17:56.434 --> 00:18:00.409
even after this crisis,

00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:05.694
70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,

00:18:05.694 --> 00:18:08.548
we have no meaningful reforms

00:18:08.548 --> 00:18:11.922
in any of the three areas that I've talked about,

00:18:11.922 --> 00:18:13.714
other than banning liar's loans,

00:18:13.714 --> 00:18:14.790
which is good,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.214
but that's just one form of ammunition

00:18:17.214 --> 00:18:18.610
for this fraud weapon.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.591
There are many forms of ammunition they can use.

00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.342
That's why we need to learn

00:18:24.342 --> 00:18:26.454
what the bankers have learned:

00:18:26.454 --> 00:18:29.877
the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,

00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:32.742
so that we can stop that recipe,

00:18:32.742 --> 00:18:34.504
because our legislators,

00:18:34.504 --> 00:18:37.194
who are dependent on political contributions,

00:18:37.194 --> 00:18:39.388
will not do it on their own.

00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:41.458
Thank you very much.

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:43.585
(Applause)
