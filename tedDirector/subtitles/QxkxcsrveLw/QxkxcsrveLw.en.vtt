00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Many times

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I go around the world to speak,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and people ask me questions

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
about the challenges,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
my moments,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
some of my regrets.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
1998:

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
A single mother of four,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
three months after the birth of my fourth child,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
I went to do a job

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
as a research assistant.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I went to Northern Liberia.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And as part of the work,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
the village would give you lodgings.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And they gave me lodging with a single mother

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
and her daughter.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
This girl happened to be

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
the only girl in the entire village

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
who had made it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
to the ninth grade.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
She was the laughing stock of the community.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Her mother was often told by other women,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
"You and your child

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
will die poor."

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
After two weeks of working in that village,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
it was time to go back.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.260
The mother came to me, knelt down,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.260
and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I wish for her

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
to be a nurse."

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
I couldn't afford to.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
With tears in my eyes,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I said, "No."

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Two months later,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
I go to another village

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
on the same assignment

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and they asked me to live with the village chief.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
The women's chief of the village has this little girl,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
fair color like me,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
totally dirty.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
And all day she walked around

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
only in her underwear.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
When I asked, "Who is that?"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
She said, "That's Wei.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
The meaning of her name is pig.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Her mother died while giving birth to her,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
and no one had any idea who her father was."

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
For two weeks, she became my companion,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
slept with me.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
I bought her used clothes

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
and bought her her first doll.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
The night before I left,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
she came to the room

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
I wish to go with you.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I wish to go to school."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Dirt poor, no money,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
living with my parents,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
I again said, "No."

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Two months later,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
both of those villages fell into another war.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
Till today, I have no idea

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
where those two girls are.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Fast-forward, 2004:

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
In the peak of our activism,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
the minister of Gender Liberia called me

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I want you to bring her home

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
because we don't have safe homes."

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
The story of this little girl:

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
She had been raped

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
by her paternal grandfather

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
every day for six months.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
She came to me bloated,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
very pale.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
She'd lie beside me

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
I wish to go to school."

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
2010:

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
A young woman stands before President Sirleaf

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and gives her testimony

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
of how she and her siblings live together,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
their father and mother died during the war.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
She's 19; her dream is to go to college

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
to be able to support them.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
She's highly athletic.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
One of the things that happens

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
is that she applies for a scholarship.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Full scholarship. She gets it.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Her dream of going to school,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
her wish of being educated,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
is finally here.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
She goes to school on the first day.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
The director of sports

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
who's responsible for getting her into the program

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
asks her to come out of class.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And for the next three years,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
her fate will be

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
having sex with him every day,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
as a favor for getting her in school.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.260
Globally, we have policies,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
international instruments,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
work leaders.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Great people have made commitments --

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
we will protect our children

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
from want and from fear.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.260
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Other countries come with different things.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
There is a Millennium Development called Three

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.260
that focuses on girls.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
All of these great works by great people

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
aimed at getting young people

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
to where we want to get them globally,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
I think, has failed.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
In Liberia, for example,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the teenage pregnancy rate

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.260
is three to every 10 girls.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Teen prostitution is at its peak.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
In one community, we're told,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
you wake up in the morning

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.260
and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.260
for less than a dollar a night.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It's disheartening, it's sad.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And then someone asked me,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
"So where is the hope?"

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Several years ago, a few friends of mine

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
decided we needed to bridge the disconnect

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
between our generation

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
and the generation of young women.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It's not enough to say

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
when your girls' kids are totally out there

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
and no hope, or seemingly no hope.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
We created a space

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
called the Young Girls Transformative Project.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
We go into rural communities

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and all we do, like has been done in this room,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
is create the space.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
When these girls sit,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
you unlock intelligence,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
you unlock passion,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
you unlock commitment,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
you unlock focus,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
you unlock great leaders.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Today, we've worked with over 300.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And some of those girls

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
who walked in the room very shy

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
have taken bold steps, as young mothers,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
to go out there and advocate

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
for the rights of other young women.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
One young woman I met,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
teen mother of four,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
never thought about finishing high school,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
graduated successfully;

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
never thought about going to college,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
enrolled in college.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
One day she said to me,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
"My wish is to finish college

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
and be able to support my children."

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
She's at a place where she can't find money

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
to go to school.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
She sells water, sells soft drinks

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.260
and sells recharge cards for cellphones.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And you would think she would take that money

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
and put it back into her education.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Juanita is her name.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
She takes that money

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and finds single mothers in her community

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
to send back to school.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Says, "Leymah, my wish

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
is to be educated.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And if I can't be educated,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
when I see some of my sisters being educated,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
my wish has been fulfilled.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
I wish for a better life.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
I wish for food for my children.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.260
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
This is the dream of the African girl.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
Several years ago,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
there was one African girl.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
This girl had a son

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
who wished for a piece of doughnut

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
because he was extremely hungry.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
Angry, frustrated,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
really upset

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
about the state of her society

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and the state of her children,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
this young girl started a movement,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
a movement of ordinary women

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
banding together

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
to build peace.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I will fulfill the wish.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
This is another African girl's wish.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
I failed to do this.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman --

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
I failed, I failed, I failed.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So I will do this.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Women came out,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
protested a brutal dictator,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
fearlessly spoke.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
the wish of peace came true.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
This young woman

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
wished also to go to school.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
She went to school.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
This young woman wished for other things to happen,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
it happened for her.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Today, this young woman is me,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
a Nobel laureate.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
I'm now on a journey

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
to fulfill the wish,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
in my tiny capacity,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
of little African girls --

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
the wish of being educated.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
We set up a foundation.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
We're giving full four-year scholarships

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
to girls from villages that we see with potential.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I don't have much to ask of you.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
I've also been to places in this U.S.,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
and I know that girls in this country

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
also have wishes,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
a wish for a better life

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
somewhere in downtown L.A.,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
a wish for a better life somewhere in New York,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
a wish for a better life

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
somewhere in New Jersey.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
Will you journey with me

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
to help that girl,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
be it an African girl or an American girl

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
or a Japanese girl,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
fulfill her wish,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
fulfill her dream,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
achieve that dream?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Because all of these

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
great innovators and inventors

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that we've talked to and seen

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
over the last few days

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
are also sitting in tiny corners

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
in different parts of the world,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
and all they're asking us to do

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
is create that space

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
to unlock the intelligence,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
unlock the passion,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
unlock all of the great things

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
that they hold within themselves.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
Thank you.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:11:12.260
(Applause)

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Right now in Liberia,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
what do you see

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
as the main issue that troubles you?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
LG: I've been asked to lead

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
As part of my work,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.260
I'm doing these tours

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
in different villages and towns --

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.260
13, 15 hours on dirt roads --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
and there is no community that I've gone into

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
that I haven't seen intelligent girls.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
But sadly,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
the vision of a great future,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
or the dream of a great future,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
is just a dream,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
because you have all of these vices.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
So what troubles me

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.260
is that I was at that place

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and somehow I'm at this place,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
and I just don't want to be the only one

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
at this place.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
I'm looking for ways

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
for other girls to be with me.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I want to look back 20 years from now

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and see that there's another Liberian girl,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
standing on this TED stage.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
And maybe, just maybe, saying,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
"Because of that Nobel laureate

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
I'm here today."

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
So I'm troubled

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
when I see them like there's no hope.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
But I'm also not pessimistic,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
because I know it doesn't take a lot

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
to get them charged up.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
CA: And in the last year,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
tell us one hopeful thing

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
that you've seen happening.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
But in the last year,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
where President Sirleaf comes from, her village,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
we went there to work with these girls.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
And we could not find 25 girls

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
in high school.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
All of these girls went to the gold mine,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and they were predominantly prostitutes

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
doing other things.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
We took 50 of those girls

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
and we worked with them.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And this was at the beginning of elections.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
This is one place where women were never --

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
even the older ones

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
barely sat in the circle with the men.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
These girls banded together and formed a group

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and launched a campaign

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
for voter registration.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
This is a real rural village.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And the theme they used was:

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
"Even pretty girls vote."

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
They were able to mobilize young women.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
But not only did they do that,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
they went to those who were running for seats

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
to ask them, "What is it

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
that you will give the girls of this community

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
when you win?"

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
And one of the guys

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
who already had a seat was very --

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and he was one of those really fighting in parliament

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
to overturn that law

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
because he called it barbaric.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And when the girls started engaging him,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
he was very hostile towards them.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
These little girls turned to him and said,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
"We will vote you out of office."

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
He's out of office today.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:24.260
(Applause)

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
CA: Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
LG: You're welcome. (CA: Thank you.)

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.260
(Applause)
