00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:14.364
I'm really glad to be here.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.703
I'm glad you're here,

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:18.560
because that would be a little weird.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.565
I'm glad we're all here.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:25.156
And by "here," I don't mean here.

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:27.981
Or here.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.880
But here.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.054
I mean Earth.

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:35.570
And by "we," I don't mean
those of us in this auditorium,

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:37.064
but life,

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:38.537
all life on Earth --

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:43.943
(Laughter)

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.271
from complex to single-celled,

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.619
from mold to mushrooms

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:50.021
to flying bears.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:51.411
(Laughter)

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:55.245
The interesting thing is,

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.300
Earth is the only place
we know of that has life --

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.201
8.7 million species.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.914
We've looked other places,

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:04.035
maybe not as hard
as we should or we could,

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.986
but we've looked and haven't found any;

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.286
Earth is the only place
we know of with life.

00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:10.592
Is Earth special?

00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:14.045
This is a question I've wanted
to know the answer to

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.323
since I was a small child,

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:17.379
and I suspect 80 percent
of this auditorium

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:20.411
has thought the same thing
and also wanted to know the answer.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.046
To understand whether
there are any planets --

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.348
out there in our solar system or beyond --

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:26.830
that can support life,

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:30.051
the first step is to understand
what life here requires.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.138
It turns out, of all of those
8.7 million species,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.360
life only needs three things.

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:39.884
On one side, all life
on Earth needs energy.

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.393
Complex life like us derives
our energy from the sun,

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:45.518
but life deep underground
can get its energy

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.264
from things like chemical reactions.

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:49.439
There are a number
of different energy sources

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:50.706
available on all planets.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.556
On the other side,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.285
all life needs food or nourishment.

00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:00.215
And this seems like a tall order,
especially if you want a succulent tomato.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.955
(Laughter)

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.045
However, all life on Earth
derives its nourishment

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.099
from only six chemical elements,

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:10.127
and these elements can be found
on any planetary body

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:11.487
in our solar system.

00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:15.764
So that leaves the thing
in the middle as the tall pole,

00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:17.742
the thing that's hardest to achieve.

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:19.658
Not moose, but water.

00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:22.463
(Laughter)

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.079
Although moose would be pretty cool.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.261
(Laughter)

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:31.820
And not frozen water, and not water
in a gaseous state, but liquid water.

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:35.201
This is what life needs
to survive, all life.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.016
And many solar system bodies
don't have liquid water,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.676
and so we don't look there.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.693
Other solar system bodies
might have abundant liquid water,

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:45.052
even more than Earth,

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:47.526
but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.811
and so it's hard to access,
it's hard to get to,

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.554
it's hard to even find out
if there's any life there.

00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:56.470
So that leaves a few bodies
that we should think about.

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.923
So let's make the problem
simpler for ourselves.

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:02.288
Let's think only about liquid water
on the surface of a planet.

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:05.268
There are only three bodies
to think about in our solar system,

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.874
with regard to liquid water
on the surface of a planet,

00:03:07.898 --> 00:03:12.724
and in order of distance from the sun,
it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:16.637
You want to have an atmosphere
for water to be liquid.

00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.039
You have to be very careful
with that atmosphere.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:22.475
You can't have too much atmosphere,
too thick or too warm an atmosphere,

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.404
because then you end up
too hot like Venus,

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:27.165
and you can't have liquid water.

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.142
But if you have too little atmosphere
and it's too thin and too cold,

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.190
you end up like Mars, too cold.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.340
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,

00:03:36.364 --> 00:03:37.528
and Earth is just right.

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:41.027
You can look at these images behind me
and you can see automatically

00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.648
where life can survive
in our solar system.

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:45.896
It's a Goldilocks-type problem,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.410
and it's so simple
that a child could understand it.

00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:50.632
However,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.378
I'd like to remind you of two things

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:57.356
from the Goldilocks story
that we may not think about so often

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.476
but that I think are really relevant here.

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:01.206
Number one:

00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:05.103
if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.841
when Goldilocks walks into the room,

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:10.785
does that mean it's always been too cold?

00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:15.093
Or could it have been just right
at some other time?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.331
When Goldilocks walks into the room
determines the answer

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.687
that we get in the story.

00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:22.844
And the same is true with planets.

00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:24.894
They're not static things. They change.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.660
They vary. They evolve.

00:04:26.684 --> 00:04:28.727
And atmospheres do the same.

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.453
So let me give you an example.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:32.479
Here's one of my favorite
pictures of Mars.

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:35.634
It's not the highest resolution image,
it's not the sexiest image,

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:37.161
it's not the most recent image,

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:40.679
but it's an image that shows riverbeds
cut into the surface of the planet;

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.904
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:50.401
riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands
or tens of thousands of years to form.

00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:52.043
This can't happen on Mars today.

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:54.548
The atmosphere of Mars today
is too thin and too cold

00:04:54.572 --> 00:04:56.713
for water to be stable as a liquid.

00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:01.085
This one image tells you
that the atmosphere of Mars changed,

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.141
and it changed in big ways.

00:05:03.714 --> 00:05:08.523
And it changed from a state
that we would define as habitable,

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:12.137
because the three requirements
for life were present long ago.

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:15.117
Where did that atmosphere go

00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:17.961
that allowed water
to be liquid at the surface?

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.332
Well, one idea is it escaped
away to space.

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:24.023
Atmospheric particles
got enough energy to break free

00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:25.700
from the gravity of the planet,

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.413
escaping away to space, never to return.

00:05:28.437 --> 00:05:31.125
And this happens with all bodies
with atmospheres.

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:32.321
Comets have tails

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:35.602
that are incredibly visible reminders
of atmospheric escape.

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.035
But Venus also has an atmosphere
that escapes with time,

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.719
and Mars and Earth as well.

00:05:40.743 --> 00:05:43.711
It's just a matter of degree
and a matter of scale.

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:46.768
So we'd like to figure out
how much escaped over time

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:48.908
so we can explain this transition.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.543
How do atmospheres
get their energy for escape?

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.698
How do particles get
enough energy to escape?

00:05:53.722 --> 00:05:56.907
There are two ways, if we're going
to reduce things a little bit.

00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:58.082
Number one, sunlight.

00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:01.518
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed
by atmospheric particles

00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:03.256
and warm the particles.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.388
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --

00:06:05.412 --> 00:06:06.883
(Laughter)

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:09.605
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.121
(Laughter)

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:14.148
They get enough energy
to escape and break free

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:16.672
from the gravity of the planet
just by warming.

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:19.858
A second way they can get energy
is from the solar wind.

00:06:19.882 --> 00:06:24.908
These are particles, mass, material,
spit out from the surface of the sun,

00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:27.336
and they go screaming
through the solar system

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.145
at 400 kilometers per second,

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.763
sometimes faster during solar storms,

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.509
and they go hurtling
through interplanetary space

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:36.979
towards planets and their atmospheres,

00:06:37.003 --> 00:06:38.628
and they may provide energy

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.780
for atmospheric particles
to escape as well.

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:43.151
This is something that I'm interested in,

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:44.888
because it relates to habitability.

00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:48.510
I mentioned that there were two things
about the Goldilocks story

00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:51.518
that I wanted to bring to your attention
and remind you about,

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:53.781
and the second one
is a little bit more subtle.

00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:56.593
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.414
and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:06.168
shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder

00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:08.877
if we're following the trend?

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:12.507
This thing that you've accepted
your entire life,

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:15.601
when you think about it a little bit more,
may not be so simple.

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:20.541
And of course, distance of a planet
from the sun determines its temperature.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.831
This has to play into habitability.

00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:25.785
But maybe there are other things
we should be thinking about.

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:27.425
Maybe it's the bowls themselves

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.505
that are also helping to determine
the outcome in the story,

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:31.829
what is just right.

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:35.630
I could talk to you about a lot
of different characteristics

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:36.805
of these three planets

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:38.398
that may influence habitability,

00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:41.016
but for selfish reasons related
to my own research

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.628
and the fact that I'm standing up here
holding the clicker and you're not --

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:45.658
(Laughter)

00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:47.791
I would like to talk
for just a minute or two

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:49.112
about magnetic fields.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:52.247
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.

00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:55.948
Magnetic fields are generated
in the deep interior of a planet

00:07:55.972 --> 00:07:59.689
by electrically conducting
churning fluid material

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.618
that creates this big old magnetic field
that surrounds Earth.

00:08:02.642 --> 00:08:05.038
If you have a compass,
you know which way north is.

00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:06.556
Venus and Mars don't have that.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.494
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,

00:08:08.518 --> 00:08:09.914
congratulations, you're lost.

00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:11.841
(Laughter)

00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:13.905
Does this influence habitability?

00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:16.477
Well, how might it?

00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:19.628
Many scientists think
that a magnetic field of a planet

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:22.047
serves as a shield for the atmosphere,

00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.426
deflecting solar wind particles
around the planet

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.265
in a bit of a force field-type effect

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.989
having to do with electric charge
of those particles.

00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:33.989
I like to think of it instead
as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.292
(Laughter)

00:08:36.962 --> 00:08:40.343
And yes, my colleagues
who watch this later will realize

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:42.911
this is the first time in the history
of our community

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:45.214
that the solar wind has been
equated with mucus.

00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:46.888
(Laughter)

00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:52.453
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth
may have been protected

00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:53.646
for billions of years,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.520
because we've had a magnetic field.

00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:57.723
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.

00:08:57.747 --> 00:08:59.854
Mars, on the other hand,
has been unprotected

00:08:59.878 --> 00:09:01.720
because of its lack of magnetic field,

00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:03.696
and over billions of years,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.900
maybe enough atmosphere
has been stripped away

00:09:05.924 --> 00:09:08.517
to account for a transition
from a habitable planet

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:10.207
to the planet that we see today.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:14.048
Other scientists think
that magnetic fields

00:09:14.072 --> 00:09:16.235
may act more like the sails on a ship,

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:21.995
enabling the planet to interact
with more energy from the solar wind

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.291
than the planet would have been able
to interact with by itself.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.806
The sails may gather energy
from the solar wind.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.496
The magnetic field may gather
energy from the solar wind

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.764
that allows even more
atmospheric escape to happen.

00:09:33.788 --> 00:09:36.042
It's an idea that has to be tested,

00:09:36.066 --> 00:09:37.951
but the effect and how it works

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.126
seems apparent.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.301
That's because we know

00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:43.400
energy from the solar wind
is being deposited into our atmosphere

00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:44.575
here on Earth.

00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:47.004
That energy is conducted
along magnetic field lines

00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:48.376
down into the polar regions,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.536
resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.216
If you've ever experienced them,
it's magnificent.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.246
We know the energy is getting in.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.303
We're trying to measure
how many particles are getting out

00:09:58.327 --> 00:10:01.365
and if the magnetic field
is influencing this in any way.

00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:05.102
So I've posed a problem for you here,

00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:06.672
but I don't have a solution yet.

00:10:06.696 --> 00:10:07.972
We don't have a solution.

00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:11.059
But we're working on it.
How are we working on it?

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.381
Well, we've sent spacecraft
to all three planets.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:14.881
Some of them are orbiting now,

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.977
including the MAVEN spacecraft
which is currently orbiting Mars,

00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:21.533
which I'm involved with
and which is led here,

00:10:21.557 --> 00:10:23.366
out of the University of Colorado.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.672
It's designed to measure
atmospheric escape.

00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:28.496
We have similar measurements
from Venus and Earth.

00:10:28.953 --> 00:10:30.618
Once we have all our measurements,

00:10:30.642 --> 00:10:33.517
we can combine all these together,
and we can understand

00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:36.958
how all three planets interact
with their space environment,

00:10:36.982 --> 00:10:38.144
with the surroundings.

00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:41.690
And we can decide whether magnetic fields
are important for habitability

00:10:41.714 --> 00:10:42.872
or not.

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:45.161
Once we have that answer,
why should you care?

00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:46.485
I mean, I care deeply ...

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:50.134
And financially as well, but deeply.

00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:52.000
(Laughter)

00:10:52.763 --> 00:10:54.681
First of all, an answer to this question

00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:56.808
will teach us more
about these three planets,

00:10:56.832 --> 00:10:57.992
Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:00.927
not only about how they interact
with their environment today,

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.878
but how they were billions of years ago,

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:04.964
whether they were habitable
long ago or not.

00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:06.632
It will teach us about atmospheres

00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.651
that surround us and that are close.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.311
But moreover, what we learn
from these planets

00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:13.356
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,

00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:17.398
including planets that we're now
observing around other stars.

00:11:17.422 --> 00:11:19.177
For example, the Kepler spacecraft,

00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:22.409
which is built and controlled
here in Boulder,

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:25.718
has been observing
a postage stamp-sized region of the sky

00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:26.989
for a couple years now,

00:11:27.013 --> 00:11:29.241
and it's found thousands of planets --

00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:32.178
in one postage stamp-sized
region of the sky

00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:36.291
that we don't think is any different
from any other part of the sky.

00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:38.625
We've gone, in 20 years,

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:42.686
from knowing of zero planets
outside of our solar system,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.463
to now having so many,

00:11:44.487 --> 00:11:47.626
that we don't know
which ones to investigate first.

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:50.729
Any lever will help.

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:56.123
In fact, based on observations
that Kepler's taken

00:11:56.147 --> 00:11:58.276
and other similar observations,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.469
we now believe that,

00:11:59.493 --> 00:12:04.192
of the 200 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy alone,

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:09.390
on average, every star
has at least one planet.

00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:12.322
In addition to that,

00:12:12.346 --> 00:12:18.047
estimates suggest there are somewhere
between 40 billion and 100 billion

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.403
of those planets
that we would define as habitable

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:24.551
in just our galaxy.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.627
We have the observations of those planets,

00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:31.135
but we just don't know
which ones are habitable yet.

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:34.765
It's a little bit like
being trapped on a red spot --

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:35.960
(Laughter)

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:37.216
on a stage

00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:41.740
and knowing that there are
other worlds out there

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:45.818
and desperately wanting to know
more about them,

00:12:47.174 --> 00:12:51.108
wanting to interrogate them and find out
if maybe just one or two of them

00:12:51.132 --> 00:12:52.742
are a little bit like you.

00:12:54.244 --> 00:12:56.803
You can't do that.
You can't go there, not yet.

00:12:56.827 --> 00:13:00.820
And so you have to use the tools
that you've developed around you

00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:02.139
for Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:04.976
and you have to apply them
to these other situations,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.696
and hope that you're making
reasonable inferences from the data,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.838
and that you're going to be able
to determine the best candidates

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:15.261
for habitable planets,
and those that are not.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.854
In the end, and for now, at least,

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:21.665
this is our red spot, right here.

00:13:22.376 --> 00:13:25.712
This is the only planet
that we know of that's habitable,

00:13:25.736 --> 00:13:28.927
although very soon we may
come to know of more.

00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:31.687
But for now, this is
the only habitable planet,

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.013
and this is our red spot.

00:13:33.976 --> 00:13:35.396
I'm really glad we're here.

00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:37.682
Thanks.

00:13:37.706 --> 00:13:40.937
(Applause)
