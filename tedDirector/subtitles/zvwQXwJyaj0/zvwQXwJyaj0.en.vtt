00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
You may not know this,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.330
but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm not married,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330
but one year ago today,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
I woke up

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
from a month-long coma,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
following a double lung transplant.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
Crazy, I know. Insane.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Thank you.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
Six years before that,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.330
I was starting my career

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
as an opera singer in Europe,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
when I was diagnosed with

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension --

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
also known as PH.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
It happens when there's a thickening

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
in the pulmonary veins,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
making the right side of the heart

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
work overtime,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
and causing what I call

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
the reverse-Grinch effect.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
too big.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
Physical activity becomes very difficult

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
for people with this condition,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
and usually after two to five years,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
you die.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I went to see this specialist,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
and she was top-of-the-field

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
and told me I had to stop singing.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
While she didn't have any medical evidence

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
to back up her claim

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
that there was a relationship

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.330
between operatic arias

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.330
and pulmonary hypertension,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
she was absolutely emphatic

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
I was singing my own obituary.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
I was very limited by my condition, physically.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
But I was not limited when I sang,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
and as air came up from my lungs,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330
through my vocal cords

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
and passed my lips as sound,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
it was the closest thing I had ever come

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
to transcendence.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
And just because of someone's hunch,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
I wasn't going to give it up.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
who is dry as toast,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
but he and his team at Johns Hopkins

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330
didn't just want me to survive,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330
they wanted me

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
to live a meaningful life.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
This meant making trade-offs.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
I come from Colorado.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
It's a mile high,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
and two adoring parents.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.330
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.330
and enrolled in a conservatory nearby.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
I couldn't walk as much as I used to,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
so I opted for five-inch heels.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
And I gave up salt,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330
I went vegan,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and I started taking huge doses of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
sildenafil,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
also known as Viagra.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
(Laughter)

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330
in alternative or traditional therapies

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
for PH,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
but after six months,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
I could barely stand up

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
without feeling like I was going to faint.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330
I had a heart catheterization,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
Mine was 146.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
I like to do things big,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
and it meant one thing:

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
there is a big gun treatment

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
and it's not just a drug;

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.330
it's a way of life.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.330
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
which is attached to a pump

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.330
administering medicine

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
directly to your heart,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330
and it's not

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
a particularly preferable

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
medicine in many senses.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
This is a list of the side effects:

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
if you eat too much salt,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
you'll probably end up in the ICU.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
If you go through a metal detector,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330
you'll probably die.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
If you get a bubble in your medicine --

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
because you have to mix it every morning --

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
and it stays in there,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330
you probably die.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330
No one wants to go on Flolan.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
But when I needed it,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
it was a godsend.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
Within a few days, I could walk again.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Within a few weeks, I was performing,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330
and in a few months,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
I debuted at the Kennedy Center.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.330
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
so I'd attach it to my inner thigh

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.330
Literally hundreds of elevator rides

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
were spent with me alone

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
stuffing the pump into my Spanx,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
And the tubing coming out of my chest

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
was a nightmare for costume designers.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
I graduated from graduate school in 2006,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
A few days after arriving,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
I met this wonderful, old conductor

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
who started casting me in all of these roles.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
And before long, I was commuting

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
between Budapest, Milan

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
and Florence.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
Though I was attached

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
to this ugly, unwanted,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
high-maintenance, mechanical pet,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
very complicated,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.330
but in a good way.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
Then in February

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
of 2008,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
my grandfather passed away.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
He was a big figure in all of our lives,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
and we loved him very much.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
It certainly didn't prepare me

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330
for what came next.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.330
Seven weeks later,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
I got a call from my family.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
and he died.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
At 24, my death would have been

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
entirely expected.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
But his --

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
well, the only way I can articulate how it felt

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
was that it precipitated

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
my medical decline.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Against my doctors' and family's wishes,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.330
I needed to go back for the funeral.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
I had to say goodbye

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.330
in some way, shape or form.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.330
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330
and I had to return to sea level,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.330
doing so knowing

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
that I probably would never see my home again.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
I canceled most of my engagements that summer,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
After one performance,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
I could barely drag myself

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
from the stage to the taxicab.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
I sat down and felt the blood

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
rush down from my face,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
and in the heat of the desert,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
I was freezing cold.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
My fingers started turning blue,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and I was like, "What is going on here?"

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
I heard my heart's valves

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
snapping open and closed.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
The cab stopped,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and I pulled my body from it

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
feeling each ounce of weight

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
as I walked to the elevator.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
I fell through my apartment door

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
and crawled to the bathroom

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
where I found my problem:

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
I had forgotten to mix in

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
the most important part of my medicine.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
I was dying,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.330
I would never leave that apartment alive.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330
I started mixing,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.330
and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
but I just kept on going.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.330
I attached the pump to the tubing

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
and lay there hoping it would kick in

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.330
soon enough.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.330
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
sooner than I anticipated.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330
Thankfully, in a few minutes,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
I saw the signature hive-like rash

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
appear on my legs,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
which is a side effect of the medication,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
and I knew I'd be okay.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
We're not big on fear in my family,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
but I was scared.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
I went back to the States,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
anticipating I'd return to Europe,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
but the heart catheterization

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.330
showed that I wasn't going anywhere

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
I performed here and there,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
but as my condition deteriorated,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.330
so did my voice.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
I didn't.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I had two friends who had recently died

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.330
months after having very challenging surgeries.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.330
I knew another young man, though, who had PH

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
who died while waiting for one.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
I wanted to live.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
I thought stem cells were a good option,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
but they hadn't developed to a point

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
where I could take advantage of them yet.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
I officially took a break from singing,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
and I went to the Cleveland Clinic

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
to be reevaluated

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
for the third time in five years, for transplant.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
with the head transplant surgeon,

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
and I asked him if I needed a transplant,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
what I could do to prepare.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
He said, "Be happy.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
A happy patient

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
is a healthy patient."

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
It was like in one verbal swoop

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.330
he had channeled my thoughts

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.330
on life and medicine

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.330
and Confucius.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.330
I still didn't want a transplant,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
but in a month,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.330
I was back in the hospital

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
with some severely edemic kankles --

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.330
very attractive.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
And it was right-heart failure.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
I finally decided

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.330
it was time to take my doctor's advice.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It was time for me to go to Cleveland

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
and to start the agonizing wait

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
for a match.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
But the next morning,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
while I was still in the hospital,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
I got a telephone call.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.330
It was my doctor in Cleveland,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
Marie Budev.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.330
And they had lungs.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
It was a match.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
They were from Texas.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
And everybody was really happy for me,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.330
but me.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
Because, despite their problems,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
I had spent my whole life training my lungs,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
and I was not particularly enthusiastic

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
about giving them up.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.330
I flew to Cleveland,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
and my family rushed there

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.330
in hopes that they would meet me

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
and say what we knew

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
might be our final goodbye.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
But organs don't wait,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
and I went into surgery

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.330
before I could say goodbye.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
The last thing I remember

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
was lying on a white blanket,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
and to please try and save my voice.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
I flatlined twice,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
40 quarts of blood

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
were infused into my body.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.330
And in my surgeon's 20-year career,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.330
he said it was among the most difficult transplants

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.330
that he's ever performed.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
They left my chest open for two weeks.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
You could see my over-sized heart

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
beating inside of it.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.330
I was on a dozen machines

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
that were keeping me alive.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
An infection ravaged my skin.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.330
I had hoped my voice would be saved,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.330
but my doctors knew

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.330
that the breathing tubes going down my throat

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
might have already destroyed it.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
So my doctor got the ENT,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.330
the top guy at the clinic, to come down

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.330
and give me surgery

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
to move the tubes around my voice box.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.330
He said it would kill me.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
So my own surgeon performed the procedure

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.330
before the surgery,

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.330
she didn't leave my side

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.330
in the months of recovery that followed.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And if you want an example

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
of perseverance,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
grit and strength

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
in a beautiful, little package,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
it is her.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
One year ago

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.330
to this very day,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.330
I woke up.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
I was 95 lbs.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
There were a dozen tubes

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
coming in and out of my body.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
I couldn't eat, I couldn't move,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
I certainly couldn't sing,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
I couldn't even breathe,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
but when I looked up

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
and I saw my mother,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
I couldn't help but smile.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
Whether by a Mack truck

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
or by heart failure

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
or faulty lungs,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
death happens.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.330
It's about living.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
And when people are allowed

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
to pursue their passions,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.330
doctors will find they have better,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.330
happier and healthier patients.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
My parents were totally stressed out

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
about me going and auditioning

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
and traveling and performing all over the place,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
but they knew that it was much better for me to do that

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.330
And I'm so grateful they did.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
This past summer, when I was running and singing

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330
in the Colorado Rockies,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
I couldn't help but think of that doctor

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.330
who told me that I couldn't sing.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
And I wanted to tell her,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
and I want to tell you,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
we need to stop letting disease

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
divorce us from our dreams.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
When we do,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
we will find that patients

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
don't just survive;

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
we thrive.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.330
And some of us

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
might even sing.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.330
(Applause)

00:15:17.330 --> 00:17:36.330
[Singing: French]

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.330
Thank you.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:45.330
(Applause)

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
Thank you.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.330
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.330
(Applause)

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.330
Thank you so much.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
Thank you.
