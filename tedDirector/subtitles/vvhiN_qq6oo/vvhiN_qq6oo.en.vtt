00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
This is Shivdutt Yadav,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
in Uttar Pradesh,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and he discovered

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
that official records were listing him as dead.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
His land was no longer registered

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
in his name.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
were also listed as dead.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
Family members had bribed officials

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
by having the brothers declared dead,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
allowing them to inherit

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
their father's share of the ancestral farmland.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Because of this, all three brothers and their families

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
had to vacate their home.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
According to the Yadav family,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
the local court has been scheduling a case review

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
since 2001,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
but a judge has never appeared.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
of people dying

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
before their case is given a proper review.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
led to this corruption.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.260
or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Photographing these brothers

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
was a disorienting exchange

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
because on paper they don't exist,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Yet, these men remain dead.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
This quandary led to the title of the project,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
which considers in many ways

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that we are all the living dead

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and that we in some ways represent

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
ghosts of the past and the future.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
So this story is the first of 18 chapters

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.260
in my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
And for this work,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I traveled around the world over a four-year period

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
researching and recording bloodlines

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and their related stories.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I was interested in ideas surrounding fate

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and whether our fate is determined

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
by blood, chance or circumstance.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
The subjects I documented

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
ranged from feuding families in Brazil

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to victims of genocide in Bosnia

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
to the first woman to hijack an airplane

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and the living dead in India.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
In each chapter, you can see the external forces

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
of governance, power and territory or religion

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
colliding with the internal forces

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.260
of psychological and physical inheritance.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Each work that I make

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
is comprised of three segments.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
On the left are one or more portrait panels

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
in which I systematically order

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
the members of a given bloodline.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
in which I construct

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
the narrative at stake.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
It's a space that's more intuitive

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
in which I present fragments of the story,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
And it's meant to kind of reflect

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
in a less linear form.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So it's more disordered.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
And this disorder is in direct contrast

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
to the unalterable order of a bloodline.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
In my past projects I've often worked in serial form,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
documenting things that have

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
the appearance of being comprehensive

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
through a determined title and a determined presentation,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
but in fact, are fairly abstract.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and find an absolute catalog,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.260
something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
This led me to blood.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
A bloodline is determined and ordered.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
But the project centers

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
on the collision of order and disorder --

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
the order of blood butting up against the disorder

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
represented in the often chaotic and violent stories

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
that are the subjects of my chapters.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
by the Zionist organization

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
to look at areas for Jewish settlement

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and acquire land for Jewish settlement.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
He oversaw land acquisition

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
whose work led to the establishment

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
of a Jewish state.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
I wanted to look at the early paperwork

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
of the establishment of the Jewish state.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And I found these maps which you see here.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And these are studies

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
commissioned by the Zionist organization

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
In this, I was interested in the consequences

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
of geography

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and imagining how the world would be different

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
if Israel were in Uganda,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
which is what these maps demonstrate.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
These archives in Jerusalem,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
they maintain a card index file

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
to Palestine, and later Israel,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
from 1919 to 1965.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Chapter three:

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
mental illness, evil spirits.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
He's most often paid for his services

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
in cash, cows or goats.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
But sometimes when his female patients

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
can't afford his services,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
their families give the women to Jura

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
in exchange for medical treatment.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
As a result of these transactions,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
Jura has nine wives,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
32 children

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
and 63 grandchildren.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
Two of his wives were brought to him

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
suffering from infertility

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and he cured them,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
three for evil spirits,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
paying their families a total of 16 cows.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
One wife deserted him

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
It's common among a privileged class

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
capable of paying numerous dowries

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and keeping multiple homes.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Instances of prominent social and political figures

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
in polygamous relationships

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
has led to the perception of polygamy

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.260
as a symbol of wealth, status and power.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
there are empty portraits.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
These empty portraits represent individuals,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
living individuals, who couldn't be present.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
They include dengue fever,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
imprisonment, army service,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
women not allowed to be photographed

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
for religious and cultural reasons.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
And in this particular chapter,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
it's children whose mothers

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.260
for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
Twenty-four European rabbits

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
were brought to Australia in 1859

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
by a British settler

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
for sporting purposes, for hunting.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And within a hundred years,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and it competes with native wildlife

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and damages native plants

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
and degrades the land.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Since the 1950s,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
Australia has been introducing lethal diseases

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
into the wild rabbit population

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
to control growth.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
These rabbits were bred at a government facility,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Biosecurity Queensland,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
and have infected them with a lethal disease

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
and are monitoring their progress

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
to see if it will effectively kill them.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
So they're testing its virulence.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
except for a few, which were euthanized.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Haigh's Chocolate,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
in collaboration

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
Now this was done to counter

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the annual celebration of rabbits

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
and presumably make the public more comfortable

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
with the killing of rabbits

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and promote an animal that's native to Australia,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and actually an animal that is threatened

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
by the European rabbit.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
In chapter seven, I focus on the effects

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
of a genocidal act

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
on one bloodline.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
So over a two-day period,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
six individuals from this bloodline

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
This is the only work

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
in which I visually represent the dead.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
But I only represent those

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
since the Second World War.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
And during this massacre,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
were systematically executed.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
So when you look at a detail of this work,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
you can see, the man on the upper-left

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is the father of the woman sitting next to him.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
Her name is Zumra.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
She is followed by her four children,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
who is then followed by her children

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
who were killed as well.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
During the time I was in Bosnia,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
were exhumed from a mass grave.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
And I was therefore able to photograph

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
the fully assembled remains.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
However, the other individuals

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
are represented by these blue slides,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
which show tooth and bone samples

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
to prove they were the identities

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
of those individuals.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
They've all been given a proper burial,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
so what remains are these blue slides

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
at the International Commission for Missing Persons.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
These are personal effects

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
dug up from a mass grave

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that are awaiting identification from family members

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and also the Serbian soldiers later

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.260
during the times of the executions.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
which from top to bottom

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
shows a Serbian scorpion unit

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
being blessed by an Orthodox priest

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
before rounding up the boys and men

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
and killing them.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.260
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
to select a multi-generational bloodline

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
to represent China for this project.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and they declined to give me

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
any further reasoning for their choice.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
This is one of the rare situations

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
where I have no empty portraits.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
Everyone showed up.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
as it travels through the bloodline.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.260
the State Council Information Office

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260
is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
It controls all foreign media and image production

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
outside of China

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
from foreign media working within China.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
It also monitors the Internet

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
and instructs local media

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
on how to handle any potentially controversial issues,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
including Tibet, ethnic minorities,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Human Rights, religion,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
democracy movements and terrorism.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
For the footnote panel in this work,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
this office instructed me

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
when I left.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
These are the descendants of Hans Frank

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
who was Hitler's personal legal advisor

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
and governor general of occupied Poland.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
highlighting a complex relationship

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
to one's family history.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
The reasons for these absences

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
include people who declined participation.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
There's also parents who participated

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
who wouldn't let their children participate

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Another section of the family

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
because they didn't want to be identified

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
with the past that I was highlighting.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And finally, another individual

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
sat for me from behind

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and later rescinded his participation,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
In the footnote panel that accompanies this work

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.260
I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
and an imitation of that stamp

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
produced by British Intelligence

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
with Hans Frank's image on it.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
It was released in Poland

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
to create friction between Frank and Hitler,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
so that Hitler would imagine

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Frank was trying to usurp his power.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Again, talking about fate,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
I was interested in the stories and fate

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
of particular works of art.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
These paintings were taken by Hans Frank

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
during the time of the Third Reich.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
They are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,"

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Rembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan"

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
and Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,"

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.260
which has never been found.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Chapter 12 highlights

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
people being born into a battle that is not of their making,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
but becomes their own.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
So this is the Ferraz family

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
and the Novaes family.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And they are in an active blood feud.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
This feud has been going on since 1991

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and it involved the deaths

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
of 20 members of the families

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and 40 others associated with the feud,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
including hired hit men, innocent bystanders

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
and friends.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Tensions between these two families date back to 1913

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
when there was a dispute over local political power.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
But it got violent in the last two decades

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
and includes decapitation

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and the death of two mayors.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Installed into a protective wall

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
who's the head of the Novaes family,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
are these turret holes,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
which were used for shooting and looking.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.260
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
is one of the nation's most violent regions.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
or an eye for an eye,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
so retaliatory killings

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
have led to several deaths in the area.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
This story, like many of the stories in my chapters,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
reads almost as an archetypal episode,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
like something out of Shakespeare,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
that's happening now and will happen again in the future.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
So after I returned home, I received word

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
that one member of the family

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
had been shot 30 times in the face.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
Chapter 17

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and the absence of a history.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
are between the ages of six and 16.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
This piece is ordered by age

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
because it can't be ordered by blood.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
only one child had been adopted.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.260
despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
It's commonly reported in Ukraine

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
that children, when leaving the orphanage

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
are targeted for human trafficking,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
child pornography and prostitution.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and high rates of suicide are recorded.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
This is a boys' bedroom.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
and not enough warm clothing.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Children bathe infrequently

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
because the hot water isn't turned on until October.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
This is a girls' bedroom.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
as an industrial size washing machine and dryer,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
four vacuum cleaners, two computers,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
a video projector, a copy machine,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
winter shoes and a dentist's drill.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.260
This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
And it reads: "Those who do not know their past

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.260
are not worthy of their future."

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
There are many more chapters in this project.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
This is just an abridged rendering

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
of over a thousand images.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And this mass pile of images and stories

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
forms an archive.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
And within this accumulation of images and texts,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
I'm struggling to find patterns

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.260
and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.260
are just as coded as blood itself.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
But archives exist

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.260
Something is said in the gaps

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
between all the information that's collected.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
And there's this relentless persistence

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
of birth and death

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
and an unending collection of stories in between.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
It's almost machine-like

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
the way people are born and people die,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
and the stories keep coming and coming.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
And in this, I'm considering,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
is this actual accumulation

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
leading to some sort of evolution,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
or are we on repeat

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.260
over and over again?

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
Thank you.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
(Applause)
