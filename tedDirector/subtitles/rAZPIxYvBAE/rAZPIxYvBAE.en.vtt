00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.776
I spend most of my time

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.480
thinking about little girls,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.056
which is kind of a weird thing
for a grown man in our society to say.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.015
But I do. I spend most of my time
thinking about little girls,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.200
and I think it's primarily
because I have one.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.216
This one's mine, and I think
you would really like her.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.696
She is smart and funny

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.080
and kind to people and a good friend.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.336
But when I talk about my daughter,
the word I find myself saying most

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560
is "athlete."

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.600
My kid's athletic.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.776
She is strong and fast

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.976
and has great balance
and good body control.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.376
She is a three-time,
back-to-back-to-back state champion

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.056
in Shaolin Kempo.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.776
At nine years old, she is already
halfway to a black belt.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.576
My daughter is athletic.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.776
Now, when a man who is six feet two
and 265 pounds stands in front of you

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.536
and says his daughter is athletic,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.776
you might think
that's a reflection of him.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.016
It is not.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.496
(Laughter)

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.896
My wife in high school
was a two-time all-state soccer player

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.216
and a two-time all-state
volleyball player,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.256
and I played "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.376
And that is why,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.336
although my daughter is an athlete,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.536
she's also a huge nerd, which I love.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.176
She walks around our house
in a cloak of flames

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.840
that she made herself.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.376
She sits on the Iron Throne --

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.176
(Laughter)

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.536
even though she has never
seen "Game of Thrones,"

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.416
primarily because we are not
the worst parents who ever lived.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.216
But she knows there's someone
called the Mother of Dragons,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.336
and she calls herself that
and she loves it.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.056
She's a huge comic book fan.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.136
Right now, her favorite
character is Groot.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.376
She loves Groot.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.200
She adores The Incredible Hulk.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.256
But my daughter really at heart,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.296
her thing is Star Wars.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.720
My kid is a Jedi.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.336
Although some days she's also a Sith,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.576
which is a choice that I can respect.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.696
(Laughter)

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.376
But here's the question
that I have to ask.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.696
Why is it that when
my daughter dresses up,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.296
whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.856
whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.680
why is every character
she dresses up as a boy?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.336
And where are all the female superheroes?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.216
And that is not actually the question,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.376
because there's plenty
of female superheroes.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.920
My question really is,
where is all the female superhero stuff?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.680
Where are the costumes?
Where are the toys?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.336
Because every day when my daughter
plays when she dresses up,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.840
she's learning stuff

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.376
through a process that,
in my own line of work,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.976
as a professor of media studies,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.936
we refer to as public pedagogy.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.176
That is, it is how societies
are taught ideologies.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.936
It's how you learned what it meant
to be a man or a woman,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.536
what it meant to behave
yourself in public,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.296
what it meant to be a patriot
and have good manners.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.176
It's all the constituent social relations
that make us up as a people.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.216
It's, in short, how we learn
what we know about other people

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.016
and about the world.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.496
But we live in a 100-percent
media-saturated society.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.016
What that means is that every single
aspect of your human existence

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.416
outside of your basic bodily functions

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.896
is in some way touched by media.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.376
From the car that you drive
to the food that you eat

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.776
to the clothes that you wear

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.816
to the way you construct
your relationships

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.936
to the very language
you use to formulate thought --

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.216
all of that is in some way mediated.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.256
So the answer in our society

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.566
to how do we learn what we know
about other people and about the world

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.070
is largely through media.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.016
Well, there's a wrinkle in that,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.816
in that our society,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.136
media don't simply exist as information
distribution technologies and devices.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.016
They also exist as corporate entities.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.856
And when the distribution of information
is tied to financial gain,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.080
there's a problem.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.496
How big of a problem?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.736
Well think about this:

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.496
in 1983, 90 percent of American media
were owned by 50 companies.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.816
In any market, 50 companies
doing something is a lot of companies.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.696
It's a lot of different worldviews.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.456
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.815
six companies.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:36.616
They are NBCUniversal Comcast,
AOL Time Warner,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.456
the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,
Viacom and the CBS Corporation.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.456
These six companies produce
nine out of every 10 movies you watch,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.936
nine out of every 10 television shows,
nine out of every 10 songs,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.736
nine out of every 10 books.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.656
So my question to you is,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.376
if six companies control
90 percent of American media,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.480
how much influence do you think they have
over what you're allowed to see every day?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.256
Because in media studies,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.536
we spend a lot of time saying
that media can't tell us what to think,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.816
and they can't; they're terrible at that.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.216
But that's not their job.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.176
Media don't tell us what to think.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.976
Media tell us what to think about.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.856
They control the conversation,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.616
and in controlling the conversation,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.656
they don't have to get you
to think what they want you to think.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.256
They'll just get you thinking about
the things they want you to think about,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.176
and more importantly, not thinking about
things they don't want you to think about.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.136
They control the conversation.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.776
How does this work in practice?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.776
Let's just take one of those companies.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.016
We'll do an easy one.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.576
Let's talk about the Walt Disney
Company for a second.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.496
The reason why I always pick
the Walt Disney Company is this.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.936
Is there a single person in this room
who has never seen a Disney movie?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.840
Look around. Exactly.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.376
I picked Disney because they have
what we call 100 percent penetration

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.616
in our society.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.016
Every single person
has been exposed to Disney,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.016
so it's an easy one for me to use.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.296
Since 1937, Disney has made most
of its money selling princesses to girls.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.416
It's made a huge chunk of its money.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.416
Unless, of course, the princess
your daughter is interested in,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.920
as my daughter is, is this one.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.176
See, in 2012,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.816
Disney purchased LucasFilm
for the sum of four billion dollars,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.656
and immediately they flooded
the Disney stores with Han Solo

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.016
and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader
and Luke Skywalker and Yoda

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.896
and not Princess Leia.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.336
Why? Because this princess
messes up the public pedagogy

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.136
for these princesses.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.696
So Disney did not put Princess Leia
merchandise in the store,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.656
and when people went to Disney and said,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.696
"Hey, where's all
the Princess Leia stuff?"

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.376
Disney said, "We have no intention

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.816
of putting Princess Leia
merchandise in the store."

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.936
And fans were angry
and they took to Twitter

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.056
with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.496
And Disney said,
"Wait, that's not what we meant.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.176
What we meant was,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.896
we don't have any Princess Leia
merchandise yet, but we will."

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.296
And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.851
and if you go to the Disney Store,
as I recently have,

00:07:02.876 --> 00:07:04.740
and look for Princess Leia merchandise,

00:07:04.765 --> 00:07:08.099
do you know how many Princess Leia
items there are in the Disney Store?

00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:11.704
Zero, because Disney has no intention
of putting Princess Leia in the store.

00:07:11.728 --> 00:07:15.136
And we shouldn't be surprised
because we found out that was their policy

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.136
when they bought Marvel in 2009

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.056
for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.496
Because when you make a lot of money
selling princesses to girls,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.896
you also kind of want
to make money from boys.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.376
And so what better to sell boys
than superheroes?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.376
So now Disney had access
to Captain America and to Thor,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.736
The Incredible Hulk,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.536
and they had access even

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.296
to a group of superheroes
no one had ever even heard of.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.456
That's how good Marvel was
at selling superheroes.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.896
Last year, they released a film
called "Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.816
It's a film that absolutely
should not work.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.920
Nobody knew who they were
except for comic book nerds like me.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.976
One of the characters is a talking tree.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.456
One of the characters
is an anthropomorphic raccoon.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.936
It should not work.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.136
And they made a killing
off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.696
This character here in the middle,
her name is Gamora.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.576
She's played by Zoe Saldana,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.256
and she is strong and smart and fast
and fights like a ninja,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.416
and she is played
by a beautiful black woman,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.616
and my daughter fell in love with her.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.856
So like any good nerd dad,
I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.976
and when I got to the store,
I learned a very interesting thing.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.736
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.640
well, Gamora's not on it.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.056
They probably should have marketed this
as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.136
(Laughter)

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.136
And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox,
she wasn't on it,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.136
and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.536
she wasn't on it.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.456
And as a matter of fact,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.696
if I went to the store, as I did,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.216
and looked at the display,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.056
you would find a small picture
of Gamora right here,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.816
but if you look at any
of the actual merchandise on that shelf,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.416
Gamora is not on any of it.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.096
Now, I could have taken to Twitter
with the hashtag #WheresGamora,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.296
like millions of fans did
across the world,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.416
but the truth was
I wasn't even really that surprised,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.376
because I was there
when Disney had released "The Avengers."

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.736
And just this year, we got
a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,"

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.976
and we were very excited,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.496
because there was not one
but two female superheroes,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.496
Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.816
And we were very excited.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.056
But here's the real thing about this.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.856
Even though Scarlett Johansson,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.336
who is one of the most popular
actresses in America, plays Black Widow,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.696
and Black Widow is the star

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.696
of not one, not two,
but five different Marvel movies,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.336
there is not a single piece
of Black Widow merchandise available.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.736
Not one.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.016
And if you go to the Disney store
and look for a Black Widow costume,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.656
what you will find, is you will find
Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.256
You will find Iron Man and Thor.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.776
You will even find War Machine,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.576
who isn't even really
in the movie that long.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.016
Who you will not find is Black Widow.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.576
And I could have gone to Twitter
with the hashtag, as many people did,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.376
# WheresNatasha.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.736
But I'm tired of doing that.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.536
I'm tired of having to do that.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.096
All over the country right now,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.576
there are kids playing
with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.576
where Captain America
rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.136
and it's really awesome.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.496
You know how awesome it is?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.976
So awesome that when
it happened in the movie,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.376
it was Black Widow that did it.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.976
Not only has she been erased,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.480
but she has been replaced
with a male figure.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.696
And so what is this teaching us?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.616
I mean, over the next five years,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.336
Disney and Warner Bros.
and a bunch of movie studios

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.776
are going to release
over 30 feature-length films

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.256
with comic book characters,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.656
and of those 30 feature-length films,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.576
exactly two of them
will have female solo leads.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.816
Two.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.696
Now, there will be females
in the rest of these movies,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.376
but they will be sidekicks,
they will be love interests,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.829
they will be members of teams.

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:02.656
They will not be the main character.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.936
And if what we learn, what we know

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.976
about other people and about the world
we learn through media,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.536
then these companies are teaching
my daughter that even if she is strong

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.776
and smart and fast
and fights like a ninja,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.856
all four of which are true of her,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.616
it doesn't matter.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.056
She will either be ignored like Gamora

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.736
or erased and replaced with a boy

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.000
like Black Widow.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.576
And it's not fair.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.656
It's not fair to her and it's not fair
to your sons and daughters either.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.936
But here's the thing:

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.256
I'm raising a little girl,
and she has a little tomboy in her,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.776
which by the way is
a terrible thing to call a girl.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.016
What that basically is saying is,
those traits that define you,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.256
they're not really yours,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.960
they're just on loan to you
for a little while from boys.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.856
But do you know how much grief
she's going to take in her life

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.600
for having a little tomboy in her?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.296
Zero. None.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.696
People will think it's cute.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.336
They'll call her feisty,
because in our society,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.776
adding so-called male traits to girls

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.976
is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.376
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.336
Mike is a little boy in Florida.
He's 11 years old,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.496
and the thing that he loves
most in the world

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.456
is a show called "My Little Pony:
Friendship is Magic,"

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.536
like millions of other children
across America.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.056
Now, the show is marketed to girls
ages five to nine,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.416
but there are millions of boys

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.216
and grown men

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.616
who enjoy "My Little Pony:
Friendship is Magic."

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.856
They have a club.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.736
They call themselves Bronies,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.976
pony bros, guys who like ponies.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.896
I happen to be one of them.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.456
And what are Mike and myself

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.338
and millions of other boys and men
learning in this feminine,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:47.216
sissified world of "My Little Pony?"

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.096
Well, they're learning to study hard
and to work hard and to party hard

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.176
and to look good and to feel good

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.736
and to do good,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.856
and heaven preserve us from teaching
these wussified concepts to boys.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.816
So the other kids in his neighborhood
pick on Mike and they beat him up

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.096
and they make fun of him,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.576
and at 11 years old, Mike goes home,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.936
finds a belt, wraps it around his neck,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.736
and hangs himself
from the top bunk of his bed.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.336
Because we have developed a society

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.256
in which you would rather be dead as a boy
than thought of as liking stuff for girls.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.456
And that is not Mike's fault.
That is our fault.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.776
We have failed him.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.096
We have failed our children.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.056
And we have to do better for them.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.976
We have to stop making it
so that the only female superheroes

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.120
appear on shirts that are pink
and cut for girls.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.056
We have to stop.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.896
And when I was putting this together,
people said to me,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.856
"Well, that's never going to happen."
And I said, "Oh really?"

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.816
Because just this year, Target announced

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.480
that they were going to stop
gendering their toy aisles.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.616
They were going to mix it up.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.216
Now, before we break our shoulders
patting Target on the back,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.176
just this week they released a shirt

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.416
in which one of the most
iconic scenes in "Star Wars: A New Hope"

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.416
where Princess Leia stands up
to the Dark Lord of the Sith,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.656
was released on a t-shirt

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.936
in which she's mysteriously
replaced by Luke.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.976
So let's don't pat ourselves
on the back too much.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.496
Just this week also,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.976
Disney announced it was no longer
going to gender its Halloween costumes,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.776
which I say, "Thank you, Disney,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.536
except the only costumes you make
are of male superheroes,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.680
so does it matter
who you have wearing them?"

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.256
Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.736
announced they're going to release
a line of DC superhero girls.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.016
And the funny thing is,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.456
they met with girls

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.856
and asked them what they
wanted to see in dolls,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.256
and you can see, they have calves

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.856
and elbows that bend
so they can do superhero stuff.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.416
And please buy them.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.456
And don't just buy them
for your daughters,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.816
buy them for your sons.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.776
Because it's important that boys
play with and as female superheroes

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.776
just as my daughter plays
with and as male superheroes.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.656
As a matter of fact, what I would love

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.256
is a world in which every person
who goes to the store

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.976
goes with a little flowchart in their head

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.096
of whether or not they should buy
this toy for a boy or a girl,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.501
and it's a real simple flowchart
because it only has one question on it.

00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:12.576
It says, "Is this toy
operated with your genitals?"

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.856
(Laughter)

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.720
If the answer is yes,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.616
then that is not a toy for children.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.200
(Laughter)

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.936
And if the answer is no,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.176
then it's for boys and girls.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.696
It's really simple.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.696
Because today is about the future
of the future, and in my future,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.976
boys and girls are equally respected,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.600
equally valued, and most importantly,
equally represented.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.736
Thank you.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.960
(Applause)
