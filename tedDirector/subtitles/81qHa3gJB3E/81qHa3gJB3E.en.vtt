00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So anyway, who am I?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I say, "I do hardware,"

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Valley event, to which he replied, "How quaint."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I sort of really was dumbstruck.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I really should have said something smart.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I would have said, "Well, you know,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
if we look at the next 100 years

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and we've seen all these problems in the last few days,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
most of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and they're interchangeable in some respects --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and cleaner, more functional materials --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
they all look to me to be hardware problems.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This doesn't mean we should ignore software,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or information, or computation."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
about "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist,"

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It is so much stranger than you think.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So, you may think that's sort of really crazy,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that make this possible.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is called the registry of standard biological parts.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and a few other very, very bright individuals.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Literally, think of proteins as subroutines

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that you can string together to execute a program.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This one is a two-bit counter.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for a design competition in biology.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And from the results of the same competition last year,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so that they can detect light and switch on and off.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
do "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is a pretty interesting trend,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"Form follows function," but I think I've sort of grown up in a world

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
-- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was in a lab associated with his -- where it's really a world

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
where information defines form and function.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I spent six years thinking about that,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but to show you the power of art over science --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons."

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Took me six years at MIT,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and about that many pages to describe what I was doing,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
He's an interesting little kid -- and his sister, Celine --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and what he's doing here

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so he starts chocolate-dipping edges,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
In theory, if you program those sufficiently,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
you should be able to do something pretty interesting

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and make a very complex structure.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And that's what I thought about for a long time,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because this is how we currently make things.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is a silicon wafer, and essentially

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The feature side is -- you know, people will say,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
On the right, that's a radiolara.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and it's a complex 3D structure.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
if we knew how to build things this way.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The secret to biology is, it builds computation

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
into the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And the ribosome here is another little computer

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that helps in the translation of the proteins.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I thought about this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but can we do similar things?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
in inorganic systems?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
like higher speed semiconductors, etc.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So, this is some of my work

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And this is sort of Babbage's revenge.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
These are little mechanical computers.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
These are five-state state machines.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, that's about three light switches lined up.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
In a neutral state, they won't bind at all.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now, if I make a string of these, a bit string,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
they will be able to replicate.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So we start with white, blue, blue, white.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and then from two comes three.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And so you've got this sort of replicating system.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He did a lot of this work in the '60s,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So we've tracked in the video the input string,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We set them off on this air hockey table.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know, high science uses air hockey tables --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Laughter)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
-- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
emerging from the parts bin that you have here.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So, why would you want to replicate bit strings?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that will do the same thing?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the B -- assemble from a string of components

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that follow extremely simple rules.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
was that you don't need digital logic to do computation.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but I'll show you again.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
can look at that, and that will satisfy you

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and then reassemble it so it's a linear string

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that will fold from a sequence. And now

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
when you start looking at the world a little bit differently.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And the universe is now a compiler.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
for programming the physical universe?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And how do we think about materials and structure,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
sort of as an information and computation problem?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Having totally absorbed this philosophy,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
With the universe as a computer,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
you can look at this droplet of water

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
as having performed the computations.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute,"

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So, this actually applied to the problem

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
of -- so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
don't have access to cheap eyeglasses.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So can you make a machine

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
If it's circular, you make a spherical lens.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
If it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
so that's part of the extra program.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And literally with only those two inputs --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
so, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you can define an infinite number of lenses

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that cover the range of human refractive error,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
from minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then literally, you now pour on a monomer.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
This is three minutes of UV light.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
once you've cooked it. Pop it out.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So you reverse this. This is a very old movie,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but this will show you the point.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and that was programmed in --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
literally into the physics of the system.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and structure as information leads to other things, like this.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
are working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And under no load, it's one structure.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
by putting in a very small number of

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
at any particular point in the rope.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Just by thinking about the physics of the world,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
materials as the computer,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
you can start to do things like this.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'm going to segue a little here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that I think about with this.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
how do we make things in a very general sense,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the same way you share open source hardware?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
of having lots of people look at problems,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
share the information and work on those things together.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and unless Lisa Randall changes that,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
we'll continue to move in linear time.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So that means anything you do, or anything you make,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
you produce a sequence of steps --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and they did it most elegantly.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But they can show you how to build things in sequence.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the way we make all sorts of things,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
so you end up with this sort of guy, right?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
globally to do housing for humanity?"

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And if you've seen Amy Smith,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
she talks about how you get students at MIT

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
to work with communities in Haiti.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
how we define structure and materials and assembly things,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
so that we can really share the information

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
on how you do those things in a more profound way

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and build on each other's source code for structure.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I don't know exactly how to do this yet,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
but, you know, it's something being actively thought about.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So, you know, that leads to questions

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Interesting things like that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
They're starting to invest in materials science,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
but these are the new things in materials science.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that defines the computers of the universe --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
it's sort of an analog computer.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But it's definitely an interesting new worldview.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So maybe I'll do that with this short video.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So returning to the droplet, again,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
thinking about the universe in a new way.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So that's a kite the size of your house.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And so you want that to tow boats very fast.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So I've been working on this a little, also,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
with a couple of other guys.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But, you know, this is another way to look at the --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
if you abstract again,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You could just hang it as a bed sheet,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
but again, the computation of all the physics

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
gives you the aerodynamic shape.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Applause)
