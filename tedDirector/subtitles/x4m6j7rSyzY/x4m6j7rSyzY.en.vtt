00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Arguably the financial markets have failed us

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
and the aid system is failing us,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Because of the resources, the skills,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
with the mindset to create change.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
must consider yourself a global soul,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
a global citizen.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160
And no matter what country you live or work in,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
even in their most ordinariness.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Today there is a raging debate

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.160
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
how best we release their energies.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.160
On the one hand, we have people that say

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
And on the other we have people who say

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
the problem is that we need more aid.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
We call it patient capital.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
in Africa since 1970

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.160
and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
They use Mobutu as metaphor.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
And their policy prescription is to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.160
make government more accountable,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.160
focus on the capital markets,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
invest, don't give anything away.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
the problem is that we need more money.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
and we'll hand a lot of aid,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
but when it comes to our poor brethren,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
we want little to do with it.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
They point to the successes of aid:

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
the eradication of smallpox,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
and the distribution of tens of millions

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
Both sides are right.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Even more problematic, they're not listening to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
poor people themselves.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.160
After 25 years of working on issues of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
poverty and innovation,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
individuals on the planet

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160
than low-income people.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
They must navigate markets daily,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160
to move their way through society,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
impacts their family,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And so we need both the market

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
and we need aid.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Patient capital works between,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
and tries to take the best of both.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160
and are building solutions

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Patient capital requires that we have

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
incredible tolerance for risk,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
entrepreneurs time to experiment,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
and the expectation of below-market returns,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
but outsized social impact.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
and so patient capital also works

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
to include all people.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
for three reasons.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160
First, they tend to work in markets

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
where people make one, two, three dollars a day

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Second, the geographies in which they work

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
have terrible infrastructure --

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
and high levels of corruption.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Third, they are often creating markets.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Even if you're bringing clean water

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
And so many low-income people

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160
have seen so many failed promises broken

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
that building trust takes a lot of time,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
takes a lot of patience.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
Not only to build the systems,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
the business models that allow us

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
but to connect those business

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
to other markets, to governments, to corporations --

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.160
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
I want to share one story

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
about an innovation called drip irrigation.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
named Amitabha Sadangi from India,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.160
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And he was expressing his frustration

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
despite the fact that 200 million farmers

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
alone in India make under a dollar a day.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
They were creating subsidies

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
either for large farms,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160
or they were giving inputs to the farmers

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
that they thought they should use, rather than

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
that the farmers wanted to use.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
At the same time Amitabha was

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.160
that had been invented in Israel.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.160
directly to the stalk of the plant.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And it could transform

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
because these systems were both too expensive,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
The average small village farmer

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
works on two acres or less.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
and he would redesign it from the perspective

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
of the poor farmers themselves,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
not what he thought that they should have.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
And he used three fundamental principles.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
The first one was miniaturization.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
The drip irrigation system

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
had to be small enough that a farmer only had

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
to risk a quarter acre,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
even if he had two,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
or else they wouldn't take the risk.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.160
infinitely expandable.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
the farmers could buy a second

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
and a third and a fourth.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.160
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
and has seen their yields and incomes

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
double or triple on average,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.160
but this didn't happen overnight.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.160
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160
there were no private investors

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.160
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.160
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
to research, to experiment, to fail,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160
to innovate and try again.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.160
And when he had a prototype

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
that's when patient capital could come in.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
And we helped him build a company, for profit,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
that would build on IDE's knowledge,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
and start looking at sales and exports,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
And while, again, you needed patience

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160
to move a technology for the poor

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160
in India into Pakistan,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
just to get the permits,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.160
over time we were able to start a company

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.160
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.160
community development organization in the Thar Desert,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.160
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
And though that company has just started,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
our assumption is that there too

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
we'll see the impact on millions.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.160
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.160
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160
has worked in partnership with us,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
for Africans around the world.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
Lifespring Hospital

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160
is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.160
to bring quality, affordable maternal health care

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.160
to low-income women,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.160
and it's been so successful that it's currently building

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
a new hospital every 35 days.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.160
reinvent a completely broken industry,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
building an ambulance service in Bombay

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
that would use the technology of Google Earth,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
a sliding scale pricing system

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
so that all people could have access,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
and a severe and public decision

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.160
not to engage in any form of corruption.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160
So that in the terrorist attacks of November

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
they were the first responder,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.160
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
in India.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.160
This idea of scale is critical.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
Because we're starting to see these enterprises

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.160
reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160
have reached at least a quarter million people.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
But that's obviously not enough.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
And it's where the idea of partnership

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
becomes so important.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
Whether it's by finding those innovations

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.160
that can access the capital markets,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
government itself, or partner with major corporations,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.160
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
President Obama understands that.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.160
to focus on what works in this country,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
and look at how we can scale it.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
And I would submit that it's time to consider

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
a global innovation fund

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160
who really have innovations, not only for their country,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And then measure the returns,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160
both from a financial perspective

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
and from a social impact perspective.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
When we think about new approaches to aid,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.160
it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
We've had a rocky relationship with that country

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
and, in all fairness,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.160
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
But again I would say that this is our moment

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
for extraordinary things to happen.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
we could use this time to invest

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
nor in international experts,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
but in the many existing entrepreneurs

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
and civil society leaders

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160
who already are building wonderful innovations

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
that are reaching people all across the country.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160
People like Rashani Zafar,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.160
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
called incremental housing,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160
where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
into safe, affordable community housing.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
that are building schools across the country.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160
It's not hyperbole

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160
to say that these civil society institutions

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.160
and these social entrepreneurs

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
are building real alternatives to the Taliban.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
and those of you who've also worked there

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.160
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.160
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160
President Kennedy said that

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
those who make peaceful revolution impossible

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
make violent revolution inevitable.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
I would say that the converse is true.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160
That these social leaders

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
who really are looking at innovation

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160
and extending opportunity

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.160
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
provide real pathways to hope.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
while we need to strengthen the judiciary,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.160
build greater stability,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
we also need to think about lifting those leaders

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160
who can be role models for the rest of the world.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160
On one of my last visits to Pakistan,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.160
It was about 115 degrees.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.160
And we drove for eight hours

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
along this moonscape-like landscape

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
with very little color, lots of heat,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
very little discussion, because we were exhausted.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
And finally, at the end of the journey,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.160
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160
That there in the desert

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160
was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.160
had gotten access to a technology

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
that had allowed him to change his own life.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
His name was Raja,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
and warm expressive hands

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.160
that reminded me of my father.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.160
And he said it was the first dry season

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.160
in his entire life that he hadn't taken

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
on a two day journey across the desert

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
for about 50 cents a day.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
Because he was building these crops.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.160
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.160
And for the first time ever in three generations,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160
his children would go to school.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
And he said, "Of course I will.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160
When we think about solutions to poverty,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.160
we cannot deny individuals

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160
their fundamental dignity.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
Because at the end of the day,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.160
who are building innovations that recognize

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
that what people want is freedom

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
and choice and opportunity.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
Because that is where dignity really starts.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.160
Martin Luther King said that

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.160
love without power is anemic and sentimental,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
and that power without love

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
is reckless and abusive.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.160
Our generation has seen both approaches tried,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
and often fail.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.160
But I think our generation also might be the first

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.160
to dream and imagine what it will really take

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160
to build a global economy that includes all of us,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.160
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
The time for us to begin innovating

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
I can only talk from my own experience,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.160
but in eight years of running Acumen fund,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
I've seen the power of patient capital.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
but to truly build systems that have created

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
more than 25,000 jobs

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
and delivered tens of millions of services and products

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
to some of the poorest people on the planet.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.160
I know it works.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.160
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
in whatever job you do,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
to start thinking about how we might

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
build solutions that start

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.160
Rather than what we think that they might need.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
It will take embracing the world with both arms.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.160
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.160
with a sense of integrity and perseverance.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.160
And yet these are the very qualities

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160
for which men and women have been honored

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
throughout the generations.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
And there is so much good that we can do.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
Thank you.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160
(Applause)
