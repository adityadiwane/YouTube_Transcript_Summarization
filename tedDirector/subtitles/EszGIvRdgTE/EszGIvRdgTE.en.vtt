00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160
So, my question:

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
are we alone?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
The story of humans is the story of ideas --

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.160
scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.160
ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
ideas that have vanished in history,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
and ideas that have been set in dogma.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
It's a story of nations,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
of ideologies,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
of territories,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160
and of conflicts among them.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
But, every moment of human history,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
from the Stone Age to the Information Age,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
they've all been carried out --

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
every book that you've read,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.160
every poem, every laugh, every tear --

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
they've all happened here.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Here.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160
Here.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Here.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
(Laughter)

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Perspective is a very powerful thing.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Perspectives can change.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
Perspectives can be altered.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.160
From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
in a universe of possibilities.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.160
For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
about who we are and why we are,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
and of course, who else might be out there.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Is it really just us?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Are we alone in this vast universe

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
(Laughter)

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
But, what if we're not?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.160
What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.160
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
but from the opposite side?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.160
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.160
inspire us to find ways to survive

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.160
our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
and our common cosmic origins

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.160
that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.160
we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
We, all of us,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.160
are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Fifty years ago,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
the journey to find answers took a different path

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
began.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
So, what exactly is SETI?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.160
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
and theirs might be as well.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
It might be that some massive network of communications,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
or some shield against asteroidal impact,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.160
or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160
that a determined program of searching might detect.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.160
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.160
for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.160
rather than ask what should be, believed.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.160
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.160
it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.160
in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.160
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160
and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.160
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160
including the small planet, announced earlier this week,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.160
which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:55.160
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
altogether 10^22 stars.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.160
Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
Remember, one billion?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Alright, one billion stars.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160
that's 10 trillion.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Well, what about 10^22?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Where's the line that marks that?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.160
That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160
(Laughter)

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
16 times farther away than the moon,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
or four percent of the distance to the sun.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
So, there are many possibilities.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
(Laughter)

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
And much of this vast universe,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160
much more may be habitable than we once thought,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
as we study extremophiles on Earth --

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.160
organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:00.160
in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.160
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
Even our nearest star, the Sun --

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.160
its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.160
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.160
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160
and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.160
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.160
And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
not their present.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.160
Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.160
It tells us about their past,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:14.160
but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.160
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.160
when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.160
by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.160
and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160
The first is that problems are inevitable.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
The second is that problems are soluble.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.160
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
is the longevity of technologies,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:53.160
and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos --

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.160
distance over space and distance over time.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
If technologies don't last and persist,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
we will not succeed.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160
And we're a very young technology

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
in an old galaxy,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.160
and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160
So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Let me talk about a relatively small number.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.160
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:32.160
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.160
tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160
there was abundant water and perhaps even life.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:53.160
So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160
developing life,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
not anticipating its emergence.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
Life happened very quickly,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.160
and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.160
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
is the very narrow range of time

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.160
over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.160
It's only the last few hundred thousand years

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.160
modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160
So, one needs a very deep appreciation

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160
of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:43.160
as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.160
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.160
We are not the determined product

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160
of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:06.160
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
We are residents of one small planet

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160
in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.160
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.160
on a very extensive Tree of Life,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:29.160
which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160
over millions of years.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160
We misuse language,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
and talk about the "ascent" of man.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.160
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160
but our ego hasn't caught up yet.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.160
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
has got to go.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.160
It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
Loren Eiseley has said,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
"One does not meet oneself

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.160
One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.160
and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:28.160
the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.160
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:43.160
and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
and perhaps SETI will help as well.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Occasionally, throughout history, this concept

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.160
and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.160
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,"

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and by taking the Earth out of the center,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.160
and putting the sun in the center of the solar system,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
he opened our eyes to a much larger universe,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160
of which we are just a small part.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160
And that Copernican revolution continues today

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160
to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.160
So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.160
published the first SETI article in a refereed journal,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160
and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.160
And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160
looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160
for about 150 hours.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160
but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
with the search for extraterrestrial technology.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
We've been searching ever since,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.160
but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.160
All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.160
are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160
on the basis of one glass of water.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses --

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
much bigger glasses.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.160
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.160
with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array --

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160
and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.160
and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160
who have so generously supported this research.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:08.160
(Applause)

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
and hooked together with computers.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
It's making silicon as important as aluminum,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.160
and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
Today, our signal detection algorithms

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.160
can find very simple artifacts and noise.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.160
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.160
the most distant human object in the universe,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160
106 times as far away from us as the sun is.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.160
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.160
It may be hard for your eye to see it,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
But this is a simple signal,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.160
and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160
This is a very good year.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:14.160
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
Darwin's 200th birthday,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.160
the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,"

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.160
the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.160
the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.160
and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.160
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.160
and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160
the targets for SETI's searches.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:51.160
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.160
a global festival to help us residents of Earth

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.160
rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.160
And in 2009, change has come to Washington,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.160
with a promise to put science in its rightful position.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160
(Applause)

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160
So, what would change everything?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.160
and four of the respondents said, "SETI."

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Why?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Well, to quote:

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160
that has plagued our species since its inception.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
And it wouldn't simply change everything,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
it would change everything all at once."

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:41.160
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:47.160
I think it's a problem of completion and delivery,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
because the fine print said,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.160
"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
would you expect to live to see?"

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
So, we have a fulfillment problem.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160
and then working together, maybe we can all live to see

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160
That brings me to my wish.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.160
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160
to become active participants

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.160
in the ultimate search for cosmic company.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.160
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.160
to build an environment where raw data could be stored,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160
and where it could be accessed and manipulated,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.160
where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160
And this is a technically creative challenge,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.160
and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:55.160
And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:01.160
We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.160
to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.160
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.160
We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
and get them out to students everywhere,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160
We'd like to tell our story better,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.160
and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.160
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.160
We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
into smaller islands.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.160
And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160
to Earthlings.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.160
And SETI is a mirror --

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.160
a mirror that can show us ourselves

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.160
from an extraordinary perspective,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.160
and can help to trivialize the differences among us.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.160
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.160
then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.160
So, in the opening days of 2009,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.160
a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160
and said, "We cannot help but believe

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
that the old hatreds shall someday pass,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.160
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.160
that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160
So, I look forward to working with the TED community

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.160
to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.160
and in collaborating with you,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.160
Thank you.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:17.160
(Applause)
