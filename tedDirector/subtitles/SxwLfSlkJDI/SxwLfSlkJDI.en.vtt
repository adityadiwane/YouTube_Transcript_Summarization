00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.360
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.719
to work with many of the great

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:18.445
international architects,

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:20.869
documenting their work and observing

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.828
how their designs have the capacity

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:25.797
to influence the cities in which they sit.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.640
I think of new cities like Dubai

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.117
or ancient cities like Rome

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:34.479
with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.296
or like right here in New York with the High Line,

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.867
a city which has been so much influenced

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.570
by the development of this.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.645
But what I find really fascinating

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:46.741
is what happens when architects and planners leave

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.860
and these places become appropriated by people,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.200
like here in Chandigarh, India,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.520
the city which has been completely designed

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.659
by the architect Le Corbusier.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.639
Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.260
by people in very different ways

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.582
from whatever perhaps intended for,

00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:06.888
like here, where you have the people

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.851
sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.938
But over the course of several years,

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.356
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.402
CCTV building in Beijing

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:19.240
and the olympic stadium in the same city

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.384
by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:25.829
At these large-scale construction sites in China,

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.952
you see a sort of makeshift camp

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.142
where workers live during the entire building process.

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:34.624
As the length of the construction takes years,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:37.382
workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready

00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:40.648
informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:44.091
against the sophisticated structures that they're building.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.300
Over the past seven years, I've been following

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.971
my fascination with the built environment,

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.674
and for those of you who know me, you would say

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:53.660
that this obsession has led me to live

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.082
out of a suitcase 365 days a year.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:59.579
Being constantly on the move

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.394
means that sometimes I am able

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:04.570
to catch life's most unpredictable moments,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.551
like here in New York

00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:10.944
the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:13.008
Just over three years ago,

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.694
I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:18.490
and while flying over the city, I was just amazed

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.530
by the extent to which the slums

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.979
reach into every corner of the city,

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.716
a place where nearly 70 percent of the population

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.057
lives in slums,

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:30.350
draped literally all over the mountains.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.777
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.130
I learned about the Torre David,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.673
a 45-story office building which sits

00:02:38.673 --> 00:02:40.726
right in the center of Caracas.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.329
The building was under construction

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.855
until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:48.221
and the death of the developer in the early '90s.

00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:51.183
About eight years ago, people started moving

00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:53.196
into the abandoned tower

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:55.215
and began to build their homes right in between

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:58.414
every column of this unfinished tower.

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.211
There's only one little entrance to the entire building,

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.149
and the 3,000 residents come in and out

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.217
through that single door.

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:09.106
Together, the inhabitants created public spaces

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.379
and designed them to feel more like a home

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.974
and less like an unfinished tower.

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:17.489
In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.499
They also made a basketball court.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.199
But when you look up closely,

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.680
you see massive holes where elevators

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.260
and services would have run through.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.249
Within the tower, people have come up

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.515
with all sorts of solutions

00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:33.496
in response to the various needs

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.983
which arise from living in an unfinished tower.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.182
With no elevators,

00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:41.510
the tower is like a 45-story walkup.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.760
Designed in very specific ways

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.236
by this group of people

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:49.132
who haven't had any education in architecture or design.

00:03:49.132 --> 00:03:51.413
And with each inhabitant finding their own

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:53.380
unique way of coming by,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.182
this tower becomes like a living city,

00:03:56.182 --> 00:03:59.394
a place which is alive with micro-economies

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:01.311
and small businesses.

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:03.925
The inventive inhabitants, for instance,

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.656
find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:08.781
like the adjacent parking garage,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.858
which has been reclaimed as a taxi route

00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:13.156
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:14.603
in order to shorten the hike

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:18.621
up to the apartments.

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:20.531
A walk through the tower

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.641
reveals how residents have figured out

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:26.167
how to create walls, how to make an air flow,

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.130
how to create transparency,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.554
circulation throughout the tower,

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.373
essentially creating a home

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:34.021
that's completely adapted

00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:37.299
to the conditions of the site.

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:39.424
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:41.332
they already have a roof over their head,

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:43.371
so they just typically mark their space

00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:46.287
with a few curtains or sheets.

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:49.459
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.382
and people create a space out of any found objects

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.271
or materials.

00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:56.771
It's remarkable to see the design decisions

00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:58.447
that they're making,

00:04:58.447 --> 00:05:01.082
like when everything is made out of red bricks,

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:03.347
some residents will cover that red brick

00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:07.208
with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:12.260
just to make it a kind of clean finish.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.719
The inhabitants literally built up these homes

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.876
with their own hands, and this labor of love

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.629
instills a great sense of pride

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.881
in many families living in this tower.

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:24.815
They typically make the best out of their conditions,

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.623
and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,

00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:31.170
or at least up until as far as they can reach.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.182
Throughout the tower, you come across

00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:36.348
all kinds of services, like the barber,

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:40.161
small factories, and every floor has

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.585
a little grocery store or shop.

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:46.095
And you even find a church.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.459
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.213
where all the weights and barbells

00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:52.009
are made out of the leftover pulleys

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.419
from the elevators which were never installed.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.054
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,

00:05:58.054 --> 00:05:59.673
you see how the fixed concrete beams

00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:01.538
provide a framework for the inhabitants

00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:03.005
to create their homes

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.881
in an organic, intuitive way

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.598
that responds directly to their needs.

00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:10.253
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:12.824
to a community called Makoko,

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.383
a slum where 150,000 people

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:18.565
live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:22.279
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.685
when you see it from above, there seems to be

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.850
a whole grid of waterways and canals

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.364
connecting each and every home.

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:34.578
From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes

00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:37.248
which carry them out to their various homes and shops

00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:39.923
located in the expansive area.

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:41.870
When out on the water, it's clear

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.759
that life has been completely adapted

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.398
to this very specific way of living.

00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:49.045
Even the canoes become variety stores

00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:50.985
where ladies paddle from house to house,

00:06:50.985 --> 00:06:55.101
selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.

00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:57.120
Behind every window and door frame,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.823
you'll see a small child peering back at you,

00:06:59.823 --> 00:07:02.807
and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,

00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:04.642
what's more shocking is actually

00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:08.127
the amount of children pouring out of every building.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.107
The population growth in Nigeria,

00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:12.576
and especially in these areas like Makoko,

00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:14.728
are painful reminders

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:18.967
of how out of control things really are.

00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:21.246
In Makoko, very few systems

00:07:21.246 --> 00:07:23.112
and infrastructures exist.

00:07:23.112 --> 00:07:26.044
Electricity is rigged and freshest water

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:29.409
comes from self-built wells throughout the area.

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:31.813
This entire economic model

00:07:31.813 --> 00:07:34.605
is designed to meet a specific way of living

00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:37.720
on the water, so fishing and boat-making

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.495
are common professions.

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:41.462
You'll have a set of entrepreneurs

00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:44.486
who have set up businesses throughout the area,

00:07:44.486 --> 00:07:49.286
like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,

00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:54.649
movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:56.444
There is even a photo studio

00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:58.201
where you see the sort of aspiration

00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:01.501
to live in a real house or to be associated

00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:05.800
with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.424
On this particular evening,

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:09.528
I came across this live band

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:12.679
dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:14.709
They were floating through the canals

00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:17.633
in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator

00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:21.969
for all of the community to enjoy.

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.960
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.788
save for a small lightbulb

00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:29.522
or a fire.

00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:32.137
What originally brought me to Makoko

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.944
was this project from a friend of mine,

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:36.745
Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:38.791
this three-story floating school

00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:40.812
for the kids in Makoko.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.841
With this entire village existing on the water,

00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:46.264
public space is very limited,

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:47.928
so now that the school is finished,

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:51.302
the ground floor is a playground for the kids,

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.169
but when classes are out, the platform

00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:54.740
is just like a town square,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.135
where the fishermen mend their nets

00:08:57.135 --> 00:09:01.300
and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.830
Another place I'd like to share with you

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.878
is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.637
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating

00:09:08.637 --> 00:09:11.107
from the upper Egypt in the '40s,

00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:12.533
and today they make their living

00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.723
by collecting and recycling waste from homes

00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:17.974
from all over Cairo.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.096
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages

00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:22.765
where they would move around

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:25.284
trying to avoid the local authorities,

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.603
but in the early 1980s, they settled

00:09:27.603 --> 00:09:29.320
on the Mokattam rocks

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.969
just at the eastern edge of the city.

00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:34.000
Today, they live in this area,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.804
approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:38.937
who live in this community of self-built

00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:41.117
multi-story houses

00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:45.410
where up to three generations live in one structure.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.888
While these apartments that they built for themselves

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:50.873
appear to lack any planning or formal grid,

00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:54.279
each family specializing in a certain form of recycling

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:56.512
means that the ground floor of each apartment

00:09:56.512 --> 00:10:00.169
is reserved for garbage-related activities

00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:04.192
and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.

00:10:04.192 --> 00:10:06.063
I find it incredible to see

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:07.999
how these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:10.510
are invisible to the people who live there,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.910
like this very distinguished man who is posing

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.119
while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:20.759
or like these two young men who are sitting

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:25.611
and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.

00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:27.344
While to most of us, living amongst

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:29.432
these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:29.432 --> 00:10:31.783
may seem totally uninhabitable,

00:10:31.783 --> 00:10:33.873
to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just

00:10:33.873 --> 00:10:36.352
a different type of normal.

00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:38.989
In all these places I've talked about today,

00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:41.110
what I do find fascinating is that there's really

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.708
no such thing as normal,

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.913
and it proves that people are able to adapt

00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:47.288
to any kind of situation.

00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:48.804
Throughout the day, it's quite common

00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:52.152
to come across a small party taking place

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.996
in the streets, just like this engagement party.

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:57.983
In this tradition, the bride-to-be

00:10:57.983 --> 00:11:00.128
displays all of their belongings,

00:11:00.128 --> 00:11:02.322
which they soon bring to their new husband.

00:11:02.322 --> 00:11:04.353
A gathering like this one

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:06.250
offers such a juxtaposition

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.028
where all the new stuff is displayed

00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:11.394
and all the garbage is used

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:18.031
as props to display all their new home accessories.

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.197
Like Makoko and the Torre David,

00:11:20.197 --> 00:11:21.742
throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:24.886
the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.

00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:26.966
There are the retail shops, the cafes

00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:29.286
and the restaurants, and the community

00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:32.227
is this community of Coptic Christians,

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:34.466
so you'll also find a church,

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:37.911
along with the scores of religious iconographies

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.669
throughout the area,

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:42.858
and also all the everyday services

00:11:42.858 --> 00:11:44.657
like the electronic repair shops,

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:47.745
the barbers, everything.

00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:49.918
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.607
is also full of surprises.

00:11:51.607 --> 00:11:53.119
While from the outside,

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:55.662
these homes look like any other informal structure

00:11:55.662 --> 00:11:57.980
in the city, when you step inside,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.843
you are met with all manner of design decisions

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:04.110
and interior decoration.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.274
Despite having limited access to space and money,

00:12:07.274 --> 00:12:09.153
the homes in the area are designed

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:11.139
with care and detail.

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:13.182
Every apartment is unique,

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:14.975
and this individuality tells a story

00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:18.101
about each family's circumstances and values.

00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:20.247
Many of these people take their homes

00:12:20.247 --> 00:12:23.415
and interior spaces very seriously,

00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:24.922
putting a lot of work and care

00:12:24.922 --> 00:12:26.248
into the details.

00:12:26.248 --> 00:12:29.421
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,

00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:33.278
where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.

00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:36.261
But despite this elaborate decor,

00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:38.815
sometimes these apartments are used

00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:40.625
in very unexpected ways,

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.005
like this home which caught my attention

00:12:43.005 --> 00:12:46.487
while all the mud and the grass was literally

00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:48.974
seeping out under the front door.

00:12:48.974 --> 00:12:52.773
When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:56.081
was being transformed into a complete animal farm,

00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:58.972
where six or seven cows stood grazing

00:12:58.972 --> 00:13:03.644
in what otherwise would be the living room.

00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:07.012
But then in the apartment across the hall

00:13:07.012 --> 00:13:09.535
from this cow shed lives a newly married couple

00:13:09.535 --> 00:13:11.361
in what locals describe

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:19.482
as one of the nicest apartments in the area.

00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:22.708
The attention to this detail astonished me,

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:25.379
and as the owner of the home so proudly

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:27.365
led me around this apartment,

00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:31.081
from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:34.883
But if it weren't for the strangely familiar

00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:37.746
stomach-churning odor that constantly

00:13:37.746 --> 00:13:41.191
passes through the apartment,

00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:43.784
it would be easy to forget

00:13:43.784 --> 00:13:46.476
that you are standing next to a cow shed

00:13:46.476 --> 00:13:51.973
and on top of a landfill.

00:13:51.973 --> 00:13:54.652
What moved me the most was that despite

00:13:54.652 --> 00:13:56.686
these seemingly inhospitable conditions,

00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:58.479
I was welcomed with open arms

00:13:58.479 --> 00:14:02.405
into a home that was made with love, care,

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:04.655
and unreserved passion.

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:08.039
Let's move across the map to China,

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:11.926
to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.

00:14:11.926 --> 00:14:15.616
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.299
there lived until recently an estimated

00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:22.168
40 million people in these houses underground.

00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:24.619
These dwellings are called the yaodongs.

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:26.809
Through this architecture by subtraction,

00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:30.396
these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:34.270
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.016
and hidden behind these mounds of dirt

00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:39.516
are these square, rectangular houses

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:42.107
which sit seven meters below the ground.

00:14:42.107 --> 00:14:44.095
When I asked people why they were digging

00:14:44.095 --> 00:14:45.984
their houses from the ground,

00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:48.007
they simply replied that they are poor wheat

00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:50.187
and apple farmers who didn't have the money

00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:53.588
to buy materials, and this digging out

00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:58.056
was their most logical form of living.

00:14:58.056 --> 00:15:00.954
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities

00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:02.953
have approached the tasks of planning,

00:15:02.953 --> 00:15:05.352
design and management of their communities

00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:07.731
and neighborhoods in ways that respond

00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:11.641
specifically to their environment and circumstances.

00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:13.872
Created by these very people who live,

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:17.583
work and play in these particular spaces,

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.580
these neighborhoods are intuitively designed

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.618
to make the most of their circumstances.

00:15:23.618 --> 00:15:25.523
In most of these places, the government

00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:28.052
is completely absent, leaving inhabitants

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:31.971
with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,

00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:34.943
and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,

00:15:34.943 --> 00:15:36.985
they do present examples

00:15:36.985 --> 00:15:39.433
of brilliant forms of ingenuity,

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:41.761
and prove that indeed we have the ability

00:15:41.761 --> 00:15:45.304
to adapt to all manner of circumstances.

00:15:45.304 --> 00:15:47.497
What makes places like the Torre David

00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:49.294
particularly remarkable

00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:51.195
is this sort of skeleton framework

00:15:51.195 --> 00:15:52.817
where people can have a foundation

00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:54.889
where they can tap into.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:57.987
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities

00:15:57.987 --> 00:16:00.079
could create themselves,

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:02.765
and how highly particular their solutions would be,

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:05.307
if they were given the basic infrastructures

00:16:05.307 --> 00:16:07.286
that they could tap into.

00:16:07.286 --> 00:16:10.793
Today, you see these large residential development projects

00:16:10.793 --> 00:16:13.248
which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions

00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:15.290
to massive amounts of people.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.850
From China to Brazil, these projects attempt

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.857
to provide as many houses as possible,

00:16:20.857 --> 00:16:23.060
but they're completely generic

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.965
and simply do not work as an answer

00:16:24.965 --> 00:16:28.294
to the individual needs of the people.

00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:30.748
I would like to end with a quote

00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:33.829
from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:36.595
Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.271
Shorefast Foundation,

00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:41.360
based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.201
She says that "there's this plague of sameness

00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:46.124
which is killing the human joy,"

00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:48.419
and I couldn't agree with her more.

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:49.862
Thank you.

00:16:49.862 --> 00:16:53.824
(Applause)
