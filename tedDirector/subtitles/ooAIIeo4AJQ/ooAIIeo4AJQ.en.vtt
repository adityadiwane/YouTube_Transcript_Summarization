00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
but what I'm going to try to say is that

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
even in that complexity,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
there's some simple themes that I think,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
if we understand, we can really move forward.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And those simple themes aren't really

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
themes about the complex science of what's going on,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
but things that we all pretty well know.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And I'm going to start with this one:

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
We know that, right? We've experienced that.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And if we just take that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
and we build from there,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
then we can go to the next step,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
which is that if the ocean ain't happy,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
ain't nobody happy.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
That's the theme of my talk.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Cannery Row, at the time,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
had the biggest industrial

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
canning operation on the west coast.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
We piled enormous amounts of pollution

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
into the air and into the water.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
wrote in the 1940s that

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
were so bad they turned

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
lead-based paints black."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
People working in these canneries

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
could barely stay there all day because of the smell,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
but you know what they came out saying?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
They say, "You know what you smell?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
You smell money."

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
That pollution was money to that community,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and those people dealt with the pollution

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
because they needed the money.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
and we made them unhealthy.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
The connection between ocean health and human health

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
is actually based upon another couple simple adages,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and I want to call that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
The pyramid of ocean life ...

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
we look at the ocean in a very different way,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
we see all those interconnections.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
We see the base of the food chain,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the plankton, the small things,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
and we see how those animals

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and on so up this diagram.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And that flow, that flow of life,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
from the very base up to the very top,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
is the flow that ecologists see.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And that's what we're trying to preserve

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
It's that pyramid.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Now why does that matter for human health?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
Because when we jam things in the bottom

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
some very frightening things happen.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
molecules like PCBs

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
that can't be broken down by our bodies.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
And they go in the base of that pyramid,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and they drift up; they're passed up that way,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
on to predators and on to the top predators,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and in so doing,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
they accumulate.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Imagine that when we got on this boat,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
we were all given

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
two Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
you give them the drink,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
will start moving through our society here,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
and they will accumulate in

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
the drunkest, stingiest people.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
(Laughter)

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
There's no mechanism in this game

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
for them to go anywhere but into

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
a bigger and bigger pile

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
in this food pyramid:

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
They accumulate into the top of it.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
we take these lovely little chocolates that we get

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
and we had those instead.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
instead of passing them around,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
and instead of accumulating,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
they will just pass into our group here

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
and not accumulate in any one group

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
because they're absorbed by us.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And that's the difference between a PCB

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
and, say, something natural like an omega-3,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
something we want out of the marine food chain.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
PCBs accumulate.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
PCBs accumulate in dolphins

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
They get into the food chain.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
The dolphins eat the fish

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that have PCBs from the plankton,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
accumulate in these dolphins.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Now, a dolphin,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
mother dolphin, any dolphin --

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
there's only one way

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And what's that?

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
In mother's milk.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Here's a diagram of the PCB load

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Adult males: a huge load.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Juveniles: a huge load.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Females after their first calf is already weaned:

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
a lower load.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Those females, they're not trying to.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Those females are passing the PCBs

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
in the fat of their own mother's milk

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
into their offspring,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
and their offspring don't survive.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
The death rate in these dolphins,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
for the first calf born of every female dolphin,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
is 60 to 80 percent.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
These mothers pump their first offspring

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
full of this pollutant,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and most of them die.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
but what a terrible price to pay

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
for the accumulation of this pollutant

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
in these animals --

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
the death of the first-born calf.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
That top predator, of course, is us.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
And we also are eating meat

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
that comes from some of these same places.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
This is whale meat

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
or is it?

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
In fact, what we did a few years ago

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
was learn how to smuggle

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
a molecular biology lab into Tokyo

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
and use it to genetically test the DNA

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
out of whale meat samples

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and identify what they really were.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
That's another story.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
But some of them were not whale meat at all.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
And those dolphin parts

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
had a huge load of PCBs,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
dioxins and heavy metals.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
And that huge load was passing into the people

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
that ate this meat.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
It turns out that a lot of dolphins

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
are being sold as meat

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
in the whale meat market around the world.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
That's a tragedy for those populations,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but it's also a tragedy

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
for the people eating them

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
because they don't know that that's toxic meat.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
We had these data a few years ago.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
I remember sitting at my desk

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
being about the only person in the world

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
ever allowed by the EPA.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
but it was so awful.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
And for the very first time in my scientific career,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
I broke scientific protocol,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
and then begin to talk about them.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
We sent a very polite letter

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
to the Minister of Health in Japan

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and simply pointed out that

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
this is an intolerable situation, not for us,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
but for the people of Japan

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
because mothers who may be breastfeeding,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
who may have young children,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
would be buying something that they thought was healthy,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
but it was really toxic.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
and I'm really proud to say that at this point,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
that's labeled incorrectly,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
even though they're still selling whale meat,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
which I believe they shouldn't.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
But at least it's labeled correctly,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and you're no longer going to be buying

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
toxic dolphin meat instead.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
It isn't just there that this happens,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
but in a natural diet of some communities

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
in the Canadian arctic and in the United States

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
and in the European arctic,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
a natural diet of seals and whales

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
leads to an accumulation of PCBs

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
that have gathered up from all parts of the world

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and ended up in these women.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
These women have toxic breast milk.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
They cannot feed their offspring, their children,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
their breast milk

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
because of the accumulation of these toxins

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in their food chain,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
in their part of the world's

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
ocean pyramid.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
That means their immune systems are compromised.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It means that their children's development

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
can be compromised.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And the world's attention on this over the last decade

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
has reduced the problem

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
for these women,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
not by changing the pyramid,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
in order to solve this problem.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in the base of that food pyramid,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
it can back up all through it.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
We end up with things we've heard about before:

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
red tides, for example,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
which are blooms of toxic algae

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
floating through the oceans

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
causing neurological damage.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
We can also see blooms of bacteria,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
blooms of viruses in the ocean.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
and a bacteria

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
in the genus vibrio,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
which includes the genus that has cholera in it.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Why does that happen?

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
It happens because we have jammed so much

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
into the base of the natural ocean pyramid

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
that these bacteria clog it up

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and overfill onto our beaches.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
Often what jams us up is sewage.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
where you had a big sign at the front saying,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
"Closed because human sewage

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
is so far over this park

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
that you can't use it"?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
We wouldn't tolerate our parks

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
being swamped by human sewage,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
but beaches are closed a lot in our country.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
It's not just a question of cleanliness;

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
it's also a question of

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
how those organisms

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
then turn into human disease.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
showing the rise of the infections

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
by vibrio in people

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
over the last few years.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.260
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And if you can see on some surfing sites,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
in fact, not only do you see

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
what the waves are like or what the weather's like,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
but on some surf rider sites,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
you see a little flashing poo alert.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
That means that the beach might have great waves,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
because they can carry with them,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
even after a great day of surfing,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Some of these infections are actually carrying

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
antibiotic resistance genes now,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and that makes them even more difficult.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
These same infections

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
create harmful algal blooms.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that come out of these harmful algal blooms:

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
These are things that are getting into our food chain

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
because of these blooms.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Rita Calwell very famously

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
traced a very interesting story

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
of cholera into human communities,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
brought there, not by

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
a normal human vector,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
but by a marine vector, this copepod.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Copepods are small crustaceans.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
and they can carry on their little legs

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
some of the cholera bacteria

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
that then leads to human disease.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
That has sparked cholera epidemics

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
in ports along the world

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
and has led to increased concentration

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
on trying to make sure shipping

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
doesn't move these

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
vectors of cholera around the world.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.260
So what do you do?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
that the pyramid may not be working so well,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
that the flow from the base up into it

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
is being blocked and clogged.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And he could come in

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and fix the flow.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
But in fact, if you look around the world,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
not only are there hope spots

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
for where we may be able to fix problems,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
there have been places where problems have been fixed,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
where people have come to grips with these issues

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
and begun to turn them around.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
Monterey is one of those.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
I started out showing how much

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
with pollution and the canning industry

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
and all of the attendant problems.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
In 1932, that's the picture.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But there's a greater sense here

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
that what the individual communities need

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
is working ecosystems.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And that pyramid

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
in Monterey, right now,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
because of the efforts of a lot of different people,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
is functioning better than it's ever functioned

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
for the last 150 years.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
It didn't happen accidentally.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
It happened because many people put their time and effort

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
and their pioneering spirit into this.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
On the left there, Julia Platt,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
At 74 years old, became mayor

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
because something had to be done

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to protect the ocean.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
In 1931, she produced California's first

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
community-based marine protected area,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
right next to the biggest polluting cannery,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
because Julia knew

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
that when the canneries eventually were gone,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
the ocean needed a place to grow from,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and she wanted to provide that seed.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
to lock into people's notion

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
that the ocean

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
and the health of the ocean ecosystem

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
were just as important to the economy of this area

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
as eating the ecosystem would be.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
but other places around the world.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
what we're really trying to do here

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
is protect this ocean pyramid,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and that ocean pyramid

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
connects to our own pyramid of life.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
It's an ocean planet,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
but the pyramid of life in the ocean

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
and our own lives on land

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
are intricately connected.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
that we can remain healthy ourselves.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
(Applause)
