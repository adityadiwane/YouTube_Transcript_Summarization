00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I was asked by Wilsonart International,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
a plastic laminate company, which is

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.160
the largest plastic laminate company in the world --

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
they asked me to design

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
a trade show booth

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
in New York, in 2000.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.160
So looking at their three main markets

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
for their product which were basically

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
transportation design,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
interiors and furniture,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
we came up with the solution of taking

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
an old Airstream trailer and gutting it,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
and trying to portray laminate,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and a trailer, in kind of a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
fresh, new contemporary look.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
When this trailer showed up at my shop

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
So I can be somebody that can look at this

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
I decided I had to do some research

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
and really figure out what had gone wrong

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
somewhere along the history of Airstream.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
What I discovered in these interiors is that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
there was a disconnect between the exterior shell

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
and the interior architecture of the pieces.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
In that the shell was originally conceived

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
as a lightweight, modern, futuristic,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
the interiors were completely out of sync with that.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
In fact it appeared like they

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
referenced a mountain cabin.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
That seemed really like a crisis to me,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
that they had never been able to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
develop a vocabulary

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
about escape, and about travel, and modernity

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
We really needed to do some archeology

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
in an Airstream trailer,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
We stripped out all the vinyl

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
and zolatone paint that was covering up

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
this just fantastic aluminum shell.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.160
We took off all the visible hardware and trim

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.160
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
mocked it up in cardboard,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
pull it out, put it back in.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
The main goal was to smooth out the interior,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
and begin to speak about motion,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
and mobility, and independence.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
is that when you're designing there's actually no

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
logical place to stop and start materials

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
because of the continuous form of the trailer.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
So that became a challenge.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Compounding that,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
the material of choice, laminate,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160
that I was trying to highlight,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
only bends in two dimensions.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
It's a compound curve interior.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
What I had to devise was

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
a way of fooling the eye

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
into believing that all these panels

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160
are curved with the shell.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.160
What I came up with was

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
a series of second skins

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
that basically float over the aluminum shell.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
And what I was trying to do there was

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
direct your eye in the space,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.160
and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
They also gave us a way to run power

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.160
so they function as an electrical chase.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.160
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
That trailer led to another commission,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.160
he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
He said one he would like to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160
We came up with a fantasy scenario

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
of a DJ traveling around the States,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
that would collect records and go on tours.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
This trailer housed two turntables,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.160
mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160
and basically we'd had a great time with this.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
A lot of these ideas migrated into

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160
the production trailers for Airstream.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.160
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
They came to me and said,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.160
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.160
rock climbers, would use these things?"

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160
(Laughter)

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Anyway, I went out to Airstream

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
about six times during the process of building this prototype,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
and it's called the Bambi prototype.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160
big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.160
for tooling and molding."

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
And I walked in their prototype facility, and

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
it's exactly like my shop, only bigger --

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
same tools, same things.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.160
that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160
and there's no money for tooling or molding.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.160
so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.160
you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.160
(Applause)
