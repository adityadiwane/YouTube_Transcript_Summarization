00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.481
I want to talk to you today about something

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.496
the open-source programming world can teach democracy,

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:22.131
but before that, a little preamble.

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:23.951
Let's start here.

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.346
This is Martha Payne. Martha's a 9-year-old Scot

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:29.367
who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:32.060
A couple months ago, Payne started a food blog

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.933
called NeverSeconds, and she would take her camera

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.213
with her every day to school to document

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.227
her school lunches.

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:41.116
Can you spot the vegetable? (Laughter)

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:44.870
And, as sometimes happens,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.460
this blog acquired first dozens of readers,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.140
and then hundreds of readers,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.726
and then thousands of readers, as people tuned in

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:53.394
to watch her rate her school lunches,

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:54.919
including on my favorite category,

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:58.511
"Pieces of hair found in food." (Laughter)

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:01.982
This was a zero day. That's good.

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:05.176
And then two weeks ago yesterday, she posted this.

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.087
A post that read: "Goodbye."

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:10.301
And she said, "I'm very sorry to tell you this, but

00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:13.045
my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:16.041
I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.767
I really enjoyed doing this.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.997
Thank you for reading. Goodbye."

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:26.175
You can guess what happened next, right? (Laughter)

00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:32.093
The outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous,

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:35.024
that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.325
the same day and said, "We would,

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.491
we would never censor a nine-year-old." (Laughter)

00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:40.968
Except, of course, this morning. (Laughter)

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:45.381
And this brings up the question,

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.595
what made them think they could get away

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.645
with something like that? (Laughter)

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:54.362
And the answer is, all of human history prior to now.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.910
(Laughter) So,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.835
what happens when a medium suddenly puts

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.539
a lot of new ideas into circulation?

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.644
Now, this isn't just a contemporaneous question.

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:09.644
This is something we've faced several times

00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:11.000
over the last few centuries.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.985
When the telegraph came along, it was clear

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.203
that it was going to globalize the news industry.

00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:16.692
What would this lead to?

00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:20.256
Well, obviously, it would lead to world peace.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:23.066
The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.833
but see, literally see, what was going on

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.150
elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.390
World peace. (Laughter)

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.347
The telephone?

00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:33.942
You guessed it: world peace.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:38.916
Sorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:41.395
Even the printing press, even the printing press

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.524
was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:48.177
Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:50.661
Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses,

00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.681
the Protestant Reformation, and, you know,

00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.039
the Thirty Years' War. All right,

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:59.270
so what all of these predictions of world peace got right

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.801
is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.727
come into circulation, it changes society.

00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:08.259
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.808
The more ideas there are in circulation,

00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:15.516
the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:20.289
More media always means more arguing.

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.209
That's what happens when the media's space expands.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.112
And yet, when we look back on the printing press

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:29.491
in the early years, we like what happened.

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:32.735
We are a pro-printing press society.

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:34.705
So how do we square those two things,

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:37.461
that it leads to more arguing, but we think it was good?

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.060
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.345
This is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions,"

00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:45.967
the first scientific journal ever published in English

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:47.849
in the middle of the 1600s,

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.676
and it was created by a group of people who had been

00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.313
calling themselves "The Invisible College,"

00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:53.517
a group of natural philosophers who only later

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.122
would call themselves scientists,

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.666
and they wanted to improve the way

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.323
natural philosophers argued with each other,

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:04.313
and they needed to do two things for this.

00:04:04.313 --> 00:04:06.797
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:08.656
which said, when you do an experiment,

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:11.341
you have to publish not just your claims,

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:12.767
but how you did the experiment.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.564
If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:17.924
But the other thing they needed was speed.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.229
They had to quickly synchronize what

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.683
other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise,

00:04:22.683 --> 00:04:25.540
you couldn't get the right kind of argument going.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.490
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.076
but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.

00:04:31.076 --> 00:04:33.938
And so they invented the scientific journal

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:36.724
as a way of synchronizing the argument

00:04:36.724 --> 00:04:39.278
across the community of natural scientists.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:42.776
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.922
It was created by scientists,

00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:46.781
but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have

00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:48.951
a printing press as a tool.

00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.191
So what about us? What about our generation,

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.194
and our media revolution, the Internet?

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:57.313
Well, predictions of world peace? Check. (Laughter)

00:04:57.313 --> 00:05:05.896
More arguing? Gold star on that one. (Laughter)

00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:07.207
(Laughter)

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:11.554
I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine. (Laughter)

00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:15.649
Better arguing? That's the question.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.693
So I study social media, which means,

00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:20.304
to a first approximation, I watch people argue.

00:05:20.304 --> 00:05:24.411
And if I had to pick a group that I think is

00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:28.204
our Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:31.363
trying to take these tools and to press it into service,

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:34.144
not for more arguments, but for better arguments,

00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:36.539
I'd pick the open-source programmers.

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.801
Programming is a three-way relationship

00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.085
between a programmer, some source code,

00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:43.699
and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.401
are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions

00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.424
that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:55.462
of instructions that the computer knows how to execute,

00:05:55.462 --> 00:05:57.328
and that's if one person is writing it.

00:05:57.328 --> 00:05:59.427
Once you get more than one person writing it,

00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:02.511
it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite

00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.172
each other's work if they're working on the same file,

00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.354
or to send incompatible instructions

00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:09.795
that simply causes the computer to choke,

00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:12.754
and this problem grows larger

00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:15.523
the more programmers are involved.

00:06:15.523 --> 00:06:18.870
To a first approximation, the problem of managing

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.596
a large software project is the problem

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:25.252
of keeping this social chaos at bay.

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:27.727
Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution

00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:29.381
to this problem, which is to use something called

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.361
a "version control system,"

00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:33.570
and a version control system does what is says on the tin.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.964
It provides a canonical copy of the software

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:38.516
on a server somewhere.

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.422
The only programmers who can change it are people

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:44.953
who've specifically been given permission to access it,

00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:48.720
and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.150
that they have permission to change.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.335
And when people draw diagrams of version control systems,

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:56.700
the diagrams always look something like this.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.578
All right. They look like org charts.

00:06:59.578 --> 00:07:00.985
And you don't have to squint very hard

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:04.450
to see the political ramifications of a system like this.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.926
This is feudalism: one owner, many workers.

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:12.250
Now, that's fine for the commercial software industry.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.640
It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.472
The corporation owns the software.

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:22.786
The programmers come and go.

00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:26.159
But there was one programmer who decided

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.147
that this wasn't the way to work.

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:30.409
This is Linus Torvalds.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.561
Torvalds is the most famous open-source programmer,

00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:37.862
created Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way

00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:41.374
the open-source movement had been dealing with this problem.

00:07:41.374 --> 00:07:45.998
Open-source software, the core promise of the open-source license,

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:49.744
is that everybody should have access to all the source code

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:52.997
all the time, but of course, this creates

00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:56.304
the very threat of chaos you have to forestall

00:07:56.304 --> 00:07:57.882
in order to get anything working.

00:07:57.882 --> 00:08:00.364
So most open-source projects just held their noses

00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:03.044
and adopted the feudal management systems.

00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:05.552
But Torvalds said, "No, I'm not going to do that."

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:09.117
His point of view on this was very clear.

00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:11.650
When you adopt a tool, you also adopt

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.239
the management philosophy embedded in that tool,

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:18.375
and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.684
the way the Linux community worked.

00:08:20.684 --> 00:08:23.216
And to give you a sense of how enormous

00:08:23.216 --> 00:08:26.884
a decision like this was, this is a map

00:08:26.884 --> 00:08:30.373
of the internal dependencies within Linux,

00:08:30.373 --> 00:08:32.980
within the Linux operating system, which sub-parts

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.425
of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going.

00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:41.003
This is a tremendously complicated process.

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:43.795
This is a tremendously complicated program,

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:46.460
and yet, for years, Torvalds ran this

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.364
not with automated tools but out of his email box.

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.837
People would literally mail him changes

00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:56.956
that they'd agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.

00:08:56.956 --> 00:09:01.702
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out

00:09:01.702 --> 00:09:04.512
how the community worked, he said, "I think I know

00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:08.679
how to write a version control system for free people."

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:14.574
And he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:17.598
It has two big differences

00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:19.661
with traditional version control systems.

00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:22.808
The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise

00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:26.094
of open-source. Everybody who works on a project

00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:29.765
has access to all of the source code all of the time.

00:09:29.765 --> 00:09:32.439
And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow,

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:35.376
they use drawings that look like this.

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.694
And you don't have to understand what the circles

00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:41.373
and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:44.468
complicated way of working than is supported

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:47.189
by ordinary version control systems.

00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:51.498
But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back,

00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:54.548
and this is Git's second big innovation.

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:58.544
This is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service,

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:01.894
and every time a programmer uses Git

00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:05.055
to make any important change at all,

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:08.364
creating a new file, modifying an existing one,

00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:13.038
merging two files, Git creates this kind of signature.

00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:16.181
This long string of numbers and letters here

00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:21.256
is a unique identifier tied to every single change,

00:10:21.256 --> 00:10:24.113
but without any central coordination.

00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:28.602
Every Git system generates this number the same way,

00:10:28.602 --> 00:10:31.944
which means this is a signature tied directly

00:10:31.944 --> 00:10:35.094
and unforgeably to a particular change.

00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:37.030
This has the following effect:

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.708
A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:44.410
can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.236
Each of them can make changes and they can merge them

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:51.171
after the fact even if they didn't know

00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:54.130
of each other's existence beforehand.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.629
This is cooperation without coordination.

00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:00.565
This is the big change.

00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:05.775
Now, I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great

00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:09.472
that open-source programmers now have a tool

00:11:09.472 --> 00:11:12.565
that supports their philosophical way of working,

00:11:12.565 --> 00:11:14.669
although I think that is great.

00:11:14.669 --> 00:11:17.437
I tell you all of this because of what I think it means

00:11:17.437 --> 00:11:19.631
for the way communities come together.

00:11:19.631 --> 00:11:25.950
Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.890
you start to see communities form

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.142
that are enormously large and complex.

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:35.421
This is a graph of the Ruby community.

00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:36.950
It's an open-source programming language,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.948
and all of the interconnections between the people --

00:11:39.948 --> 00:11:42.347
this is now not a software graph, but a people graph,

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:44.449
all of the interconnections among the people

00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:46.792
working on that project —

00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:49.782
and this doesn't look like an org chart.

00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:53.202
This looks like a dis-org chart, and yet,

00:11:53.202 --> 00:11:55.810
out of this community, but using these tools,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.096
they can now create something together.

00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:02.461
So there are two good reasons to think that

00:12:02.461 --> 00:12:06.634
this kind of technique can be applied

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:11.167
to democracies in general and in particular to the law.

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:13.025
When you make the claim, in fact,

00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:15.983
that something on the Internet is going to be good

00:12:15.983 --> 00:12:18.424
for democracy, you often get this reaction.

00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:24.348
(Music) (Laughter)

00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:26.874
Which is, are you talking about the thing

00:12:26.874 --> 00:12:29.285
with the singing cats? Like, is that the thing

00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:31.914
you think is going to be good for society?

00:12:31.914 --> 00:12:34.049
To which I have to say, here's the thing

00:12:34.049 --> 00:12:37.410
with the singing cats. That always happens.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.143
And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet,

00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:41.723
I mean that always happens with media, full stop.

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:43.763
It did not take long after the rise

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.439
of the commercial printing press before someone

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:49.752
figured out that erotic novels were a good idea. (Laughter)

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:52.794
You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books

00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:55.815
very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet

00:12:55.815 --> 00:12:57.983
people would pay for?" (Laughter)

00:12:57.983 --> 00:13:01.533
It took people another 150 years to even think

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:08.293
of the scientific journal, right? So -- (Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:11.331
So the harnessing by the Invisible College

00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:13.716
of the printing press to create the scientific journal

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:16.627
was phenomenally important, but it didn't happen big,

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:19.386
and it didn't happen quick, and it didn't happen fast, so

00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:22.684
if you're going to look for where the change is happening,

00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:24.700
you have to look on the margins.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.164
So, the law is also dependency-related.

00:13:30.164 --> 00:13:33.573
This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code,

00:13:33.573 --> 00:13:36.653
and the dependencies of one law on other laws

00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:39.051
for the overall effect.

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:42.483
So there's that as a site for source code management.

00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:44.385
But there's also the fact that law is another place

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.659
where there are many opinions in circulation,

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.167
but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy,

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:52.744
and when you go onto GitHub, and you look around,

00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.813
there are millions and millions of projects,

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:56.167
almost all of which are source code,

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:58.852
but if you look around the edges, you can see people

00:13:58.852 --> 00:14:01.061
experimenting with the political ramifications

00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:02.674
of a system like that.

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:04.484
Someone put up all the Wikileaked cables

00:14:04.484 --> 00:14:06.749
from the State Department, along with software used

00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:09.938
to interpret them, including my favorite use ever

00:14:09.938 --> 00:14:12.309
of the Cablegate cables, which is a tool for detecting

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.324
naturally occurring haiku in State Department prose.

00:14:15.324 --> 00:14:21.220
(Laughter)

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.292
Right. (Laughter)

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:27.091
The New York Senate has put up something called

00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:29.498
Open Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub,

00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:31.884
again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity.

00:14:31.884 --> 00:14:34.550
You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.585
a list of bills they have sponsored.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:40.217
Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code,

00:14:40.217 --> 00:14:42.982
the laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.431
not just to distribute the code,

00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:47.629
but with the very interesting possibility that this could

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:52.184
be used to further the development of legislation.

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:56.023
Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate

00:14:56.023 --> 00:15:00.209
last year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:03.333
has more access to Canadian legislators

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:07.149
than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:11.625
to show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:15.377
And it includes this very evocative screenshot.

00:15:15.377 --> 00:15:18.355
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:21.325
This shows you, for text that many people are editing,

00:15:21.325 --> 00:15:23.526
when a change was made, who made it,

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:24.529
and what the change is.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:25.984
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted.

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:28.676
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added.

00:15:28.676 --> 00:15:31.458
Programmers take this capability for granted.

00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:34.383
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:38.198
to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets,

00:15:38.198 --> 00:15:40.728
even though those are the things done

00:15:40.728 --> 00:15:43.867
with our consent and with our money.

00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:47.105
Now, I would love to tell you that the fact

00:15:47.105 --> 00:15:50.277
that the open-source programmers have worked out

00:15:50.277 --> 00:15:53.948
a collaborative method that is large scale, distributed,

00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:57.413
cheap, and in sync with the ideals of democracy, I would love

00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:59.584
to tell you that because those tools are in place,

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:03.915
the innovation is inevitable. But it's not.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:06.908
Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information.

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:08.811
Somebody put a question up on Quora saying,

00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:10.903
"Why is it that lawmakers don't use

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.310
distributed version control?"

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.931
This, graphically, was the answer. (Laughter)

00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:18.022
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:23.044
And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part.

00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:26.221
The bigger problem, of course, is power.

00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:29.391
The people experimenting with participation don't have

00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:31.960
legislative power, and the people who have legislative

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.923
power are not experimenting with participation.

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:37.468
They are experimenting with openness.

00:16:37.468 --> 00:16:39.328
There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have

00:16:39.328 --> 00:16:42.256
a transparency move, but transparency is openness

00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:46.161
in only one direction, and being given a dashboard

00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:49.331
without a steering wheel has never been the core promise

00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:52.742
a democracy makes to its citizens.

00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:55.092
So consider this.

00:16:55.092 --> 00:16:57.678
The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions

00:16:57.678 --> 00:17:01.369
out into the public was a piece of technology,

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:05.003
but the thing that kept them there was political will.

00:17:05.003 --> 00:17:07.277
It was the expectation of the citizens

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:10.812
that she would not be censored.

00:17:10.812 --> 00:17:16.140
That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.147
We have them. We've seen them. They work.

00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:21.198
Can we use them?

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:26.324
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this?

00:17:26.324 --> 00:17:30.041
T.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things

00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:32.121
that can happen to a culture

00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:35.764
is that they acquire a new form of prose."

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.012
I think that's wrong, but -- (Laughter)

00:17:38.012 --> 00:17:41.671
I think it's right for argumentation. Right?

00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:45.026
A momentous thing that can happen to a culture

00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:47.840
is they can acquire a new style of arguing:

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.510
trial by jury, voting, peer review, now this. Right?

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:57.625
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes,

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:59.512
in the last decade, in fact.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:03.565
It's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost,

00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:06.864
and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy.

00:18:06.864 --> 00:18:08.850
The question for us now is, are we going to let

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.376
the programmers keep it to themselves?

00:18:10.376 --> 00:18:12.425
Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.577
for society at large?

00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:17.177
Thank you for listening. (Applause)

00:18:17.177 --> 00:18:21.315
(Applause)

00:18:21.315 --> 00:18:26.452
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
