00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm here to talk to you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
about the economic invisibility of nature.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
The bad news

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
so those invoices don't get issued.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
But we need to do something about this problem.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I began my life as a markets professional

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and continued to take an interest,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
but most of my recent effort

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
has been looking at the value

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
of what comes to human beings from nature,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and which doesn't get priced by the markets.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
A project called TEEB was started in 2007,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
and it was launched by a group of environment ministers

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
of the G8+5.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And their basic inspiration

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
was a stern review of Lord Stern.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
They asked themselves a question:

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
If economics could make such a convincing case

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
for early action on climate change,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
well why can't the same be done for conservation?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Why can't an equivalent case be made

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
for nature?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And the answer is: Yeah, it can.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
But it's not that straightforward.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
It exists in many layers,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
international, national, local, community --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and doing for nature

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And yet, we began.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
We began the project with an interim report,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
which quickly pulled together

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
a lot of information that had been collected on the subject

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
by many, many researchers.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And amongst our compiled results

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
was the startling revelation

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
that, in fact, we were losing natural capital --

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
the benefits that flow from nature to us.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
of natural capital.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
This came out in 2008,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
that we had lost financial capital

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
of the order of two and a half trillion dollars.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We then have gone on since

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to present for [the] international community,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
for governments,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
for local governments and for business

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and for people, for you and me,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
which address the economic invisibility of nature

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and describe what can be done to solve it.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
What is this about?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
A picture that you're familiar with --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
the Amazon rainforests.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
but what people don't really know

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
is this also is a rain factory.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Because the northeastern trade winds,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
as they go over the Amazonas,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
effectively gather the water vapor.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
and eventually precipitates in the form of rain

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
across the La Plata Basin.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
effectively feeds an agricultural economy

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
in Latin America.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
But the question arises: Okay, so how much

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
pay for that vital input to that economy

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And the answer is zilch,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
exactly zero.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
That's the economic invisibility of nature.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
That can't keep going on,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Economics has become the currency of policy.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And unless we address

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
this invisibility,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
we are going to get the results that we are seeing,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
which is a gradual degradation and loss

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
of this valuable natural asset.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
No matter what level you look at,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
we see the same problem again and again.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
at an ecosystem level.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
At the species level,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
bees pollinating fruit and so on,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
That's something like eight percent

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.260
of the total agricultural output globally.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
It completely passes below the radar screen.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
60 percent of medicines were prospected,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Once again, most of that doesn't get paid.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And that brings me to another aspect of this,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
which is, to whom should this get paid?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
That genetic material

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
to a local community of poor people

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
which then became the medicine.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They were the ones that didn't get paid.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And if you look at the species level,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
you saw about fish.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
the artisanal fisher folk

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and those who fish for their own livelihoods,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
to feed their families.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Something like a billion people depend on fish,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
the quantity of fish in the oceans.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
A billion people depend on fish

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
for their main source for animal protein.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
And at this rate at which we are losing fish,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
a health problem

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
of a kind we haven't seen before.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
And finally, at the ecosystem level,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
or whether it is the ability of poor farmers

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
to go out and gather leaf litter

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
for their cattle and goats,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
or whether it's the ability of their wives

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
to go and collect fuel wood from the forest,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
it is actually the poor

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
who depend most on these ecosystem services.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
We did estimates in our study

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
even though ecosystem services --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
the answers are more like

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
That's the difference.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
Because these are important benefits for the poor.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And you can't really have a proper model for development

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
if at the same time you're destroying or allowing

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
which is your development asset,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
that is ecological infrastructure.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
How bad can things get?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
It's basically a measure

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
of biomass of various species are around.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
The green represents the percentage.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
the pre-industrial era, 1750.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
Now I'm going to show you

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
how business as usual will affect this.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
And just watch the change in colors

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
in India, China, Europe,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
as we move on and consume global biomass

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
See that again.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
like the tundra and like the Sahara.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
But that doesn't help because there were very few species

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and volume of biomass there in the first place.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
This is the challenge.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
The reason this is happening

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
which is our inability to perceive the difference

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
between public benefits

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and private profits.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
simply because it is in the common wealth,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
it's common goods.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
And here's an example from Thailand

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.260
where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.260
it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
compared to its value as a shrimp farm,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
which is more like $9,600,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and convert them to shrimp farms.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.260
But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
almost 8,000 of those dollars

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
are, in fact, subsidies.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
So you compare the two sides of the coin

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
That's not that hard.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
But on the other hand, if you start measuring,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
how much would it actually cost

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
to restore the land of the shrimp farm

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
back to productive use?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
has had its effects,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
that provide fish for the poor,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
that answer is more like $11,000.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
So now look at the different lens.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
If you look at the lens of public wealth

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
as against the lens of private profits,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
you get a completely different answer,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
which is clearly conservation makes more sense,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and not destruction.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
So is this just a story from South Thailand?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
Sorry, this is a global story.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And here's what the same calculation looks like,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
by a group called TRUCOST.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
what are the externalities?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
health cost and so on.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Use of freshwater.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Can we stop this, and how?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
When we measure GDP

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
as a measure of economic performance at the national level,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
When we measure corporate performances,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
we don't include our impacts on nature

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
and what our business costs society.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
That has to stop.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
That was in the early 2000s

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
as the means forward --

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
and wondering, why can we do the same?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And a few friends of mine and I

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
decided this doesn't make sense.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
and started producing green accounts for India and its states.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
That's how my interests began

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and went to the TEEB project.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
And the World Bank has acknowledged this

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and they've started a project called WAVES --

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
But calculating this at the next level,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
that means at the business sector level, is important.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
We've done this for a very difficult case,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
which was for deforestation in China.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260
This is important, because in China in 1997,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
causing severe loss of agriculture output

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and pain and loss to society.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
causing something like 5,500 deaths.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
It was associated largely with the construction industry.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And the Chinese government responded sensibly

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and placed a ban on felling.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
A retrospective on 40 years

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.260
shows that if we had accounted for these costs --

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
the cost of loss of topsoil,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
the cost of loss of waterways,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
the lost productivity, the loss to local communities

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
as a result of all these factors,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
desertification and so on --

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
those costs are almost twice as much

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
as the market price of timber.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
ought to have been three-times what it was

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
had it reflected the true pain and the costs

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
to the society within China.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Of course, after the event one can be wise.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
to take leadership forward,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and to disclose these answers.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
is it Unilever or is it P&amp;G

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
good though they are and professional though they are,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
do not calculate or disclose their externalities.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
But if we look at companies like PUMA --

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
once challenged me at a function,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
300 million dollars of profits,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
200 million dollars after tax,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Now that's not a happy situation for them,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
but they have the confidence and the courage

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
to come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
We are measuring it because we know

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
that you cannot manage what you do not measure."

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
That's an example, I think, for us to look at

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and for us to draw comfort from.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
If more companies did this,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
you could have analysts, business analysts,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
actually look and compare the social performance of companies.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
This can be done.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
has already set up a coalition to do this,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
an international coalition.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
The other favorite, if you like, solution for me

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
is the creation of green carbon markets.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
And by the way, these are my favorites --

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
externalities calculation and green carbon markets.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.260
TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
including protected area evaluation

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
and payments for ecosystem services

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
What's green carbon?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
It's about energy emissions.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
you get what you see, declining prices.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
But that's all about energy and industry.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
But what we're missing is also some other emissions

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
like black carbon, that is soot.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
What we're also missing is blue carbon,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
more than 55 percent.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
is more or less balanced.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
In fact, what's being absorbed

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
is something like 25 percent of our emissions,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
which then leads to acidification

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
or lower alkalinity in oceans.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
More of that in a minute.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And finally, there's deforestation,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
and there's emission of methane

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
from agriculture.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
Green carbon,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
and blue carbon

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
together comprise 25 percent of our emissions.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
We have the means already in our hands,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
a scheme for the reduced emissions

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
from deforestation and forest degradation.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
towards Indonesia and Brazil

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
to implement this Red Plus scheme.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
So we actually have some movement forward.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
But the thing is to do a lot more of that.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Well I'm afraid not.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
As you can see,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
they cut across the entire globe

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
all the way from Micronesia

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
and to the West of the Caribbean.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
These red dots, these red areas,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
basically provide the food and livelihood

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
for more than half a billion people.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
So that's almost an eighth of society.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and scientists tell us

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
we are not only risking the extinction

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
of the entire coral species, the warm water corals,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.260
we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
of more than 500 million people

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
who live in the developing world in poor countries.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
to not have coral reefs.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
Well what I will say to you in parting

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260
is that we may have done that.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Let's think about it and what it means,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
but please, let's not do more of that.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Because mother nature only has that much
