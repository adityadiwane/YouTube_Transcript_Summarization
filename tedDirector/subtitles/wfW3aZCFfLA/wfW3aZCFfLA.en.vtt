00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.015
As a matter of fact,

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:17.287
I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House,

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:21.583
and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.742
This little boy is looking up
at his father,

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:27.787
and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president."

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:29.477
(Laughter)

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:33.193
Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president,

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:35.620
because I have had an access

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.277
that very few other people
in the world have ever had

00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:41.923
to get to know so many people
around this whole universe.

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:45.545
Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:50.421
but also my wife and I have visited
more than 145 countries in the world,

00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:54.670
and the Carter Center has had full-time
programs in 80 nations on Earth.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.866
And a lot of times,
when we go into a country,

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.076
we not only the meet
the king or the president,

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:03.424
but we also meet the villagers who live
in the most remote areas of Africa.

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:06.930
So our overall commitment
at the Carter Center

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.927
is to promote human rights,

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:13.639
and knowing the world as I do,
I can tell you without any equivocation

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:17.530
that the number one abuse
of human rights on Earth

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.369
is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
is the abuse of women and girls.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.657
(Applause)

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:31.890
There are a couple of reasons for this
that I'll mention to begin with.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.360
First of all is the misinterpretation
of religious scriptures, holy scriptures,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.983
in the Bible, Old Testament,
New Testament, Quran and so forth,

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:48.246
and these have been misinterpreted by men
who are now in the ascendant positions

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:50.875
in the synagogues and the churches
and in the mosques.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:54.706
And they interpret these rules
to make sure that women

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:58.960
are ordinarily relegated
to a secondary position

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.848
compared to men in the eyes of God.

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:06.780
This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.891
A number of years ago, in the year 2000,

00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:12.454
I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years --

00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:14.936
I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday;

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.807
I'll be teaching this Sunday as well --

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:21.222
but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided

00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:23.823
that women should play
a secondary position,

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:25.889
a subservient position to men.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.606
So they issued an edict, in effect,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:34.510
that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.802
or chaplains in the military,

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.960
and if a woman teaches a classroom

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.142
in a Southern Baptist seminary,

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:45.555
they cannot teach if a boy is in the room,

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.576
because you can find verses in the Bible,

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:50.600
there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.410
that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.445
But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted

00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:58.906
to keep men in an ascendant position.

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:00.996
That is an all-pervasive problem,

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:05.872
because men can exert that power

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:11.886
and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women,

00:03:11.886 --> 00:03:15.670
they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.862
why should I treat them as equals myself?

00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:22.320
Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work?

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.247
The other very serious blight

00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:28.264
that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence,

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:32.858
and that is increasing
tremendously around the world.

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:35.787
In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:39.967
an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people,

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:45.261
mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison.

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:47.815
When I was in office
as governor of Georgia,

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:51.181
one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:56.290
Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.310
That's a sevenfold increase.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.958
And since I left the White House,

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.279
there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.856
who are black who are in prison.

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:08.380
We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.334
that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country.

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:15.701
And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:19.205
in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty.

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:22.411
We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:25.406
that California has spent
four billion dollars

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:29.818
in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty.

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:34.653
If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:37.601
to send a person to be executed.

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.474
Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty,

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:45.940
because it costs so much. (Applause)

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:51.087
So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people

00:04:51.087 --> 00:04:55.185
is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women.

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:59.979
Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most,

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.880
and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.130
One is genital mutilation.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.474
Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women,

00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:16.219
but in some countries, many countries,

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.525
when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life,

00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:27.235
her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter

00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:31.227
who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way,

00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:35.170
they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.591
And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases,

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:43.405
they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:46.784
And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:49.400
and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.415
This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries.

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:55.347
In Egypt, for instance,

00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:59.000
91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.560
have been sexually mutilated in that way.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.950
In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.246
of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity.

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:11.846
This is a horrible affliction

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:15.515
on all women that live in those countries.

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:19.299
Another very serious thing
is honor killings,

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:22.625
where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture --

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:25.313
there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this --

00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:29.500
will execute a girl in their family

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.377
if she is raped

00:06:31.377 --> 00:06:35.112
or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve,

00:06:35.112 --> 00:06:38.223
or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing.

00:06:38.223 --> 00:06:41.251
And this is done by members
of her own family,

00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:43.456
so the family becomes murderers

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:47.808
when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:51.155
An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:55.197
and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl

00:06:55.197 --> 00:07:00.580
are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.032
but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women.

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:05.994
Another problem that we have in the world

00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:08.732
that relates to women
particularly is slavery,

00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:11.147
or human trafficking it's called nowadays.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:15.565
There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:19.784
in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century.

00:07:19.784 --> 00:07:23.639
There are 30 million people
now living in slavery.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:29.281
The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.603
to give a report every year,

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:36.246
and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:39.893
across international borders
every year into slavery,

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.841
and that 80 percent
of those sold are women,

00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:44.977
into sexual slavery.

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:47.531
In the United States right this moment,

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:51.385
60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery.

00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:54.171
Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.772
and where I teach at Emory University,

00:07:56.772 --> 00:08:02.079
they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month.

00:08:02.672 --> 00:08:05.781
It's the number one place
in the nation because of that.

00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.987
Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world,

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:13.234
and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:08:13.234 --> 00:08:15.858
If a brothel owner

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:18.877
wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin,

00:08:18.877 --> 00:08:21.523
they can do it for 1,000 dollars.

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:25.610
A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.000
and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.504
can earn about $35,000 per slave.

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:38.613
The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:08:38.613 --> 00:08:43.458
So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution,

00:08:43.465 --> 00:08:47.459
because there's not
a whorehouse in America

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.688
that's not known by the local officials,

00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:53.659
the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:56.386
And this leads to one
of the worst problems,

00:08:56.386 --> 00:09:00.635
and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery

00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:02.586
in all countries in the world.

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:05.140
Sweden has got a good approach to it.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.762
About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law,

00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:11.316
and women are no longer prosecuted

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:14.100
if they are in sexual slavery,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.675
but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted,

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:24.463
and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:27.477
In the United States, we take
just the opposite position.

00:09:27.477 --> 00:09:33.664
For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade,

00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:39.120
25 women are arrested
in the United States of America.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.230
Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.150
France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.309
That's another thing that can be done.

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:52.680
We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire:

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.511
our military and our great
university system.

00:09:56.511 --> 00:10:00.830
In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.219
The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.564
that took place in the military --

00:10:07.564 --> 00:10:09.200
26,000.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.420
Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.590
and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization --

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.842
a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army

00:10:22.842 --> 00:10:24.978
or a company in the Marines --

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:29.103
the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide

00:10:29.103 --> 00:10:31.688
whether to prosecute a rapist or not,

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:34.869
and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:38.306
that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place,

00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:40.210
so they do not do it.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.752
That law needs to be changed.

00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:46.664
About one out of four girls
who enter American universities

00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:49.451
will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates,

00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:51.737
and this is now getting
a lot of publicity,

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:53.943
partially because of my book,
but other things,

00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:58.131
and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned

00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:00.816
by the Department of Education
under Title IX

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:05.529
because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:07.480
to protect them from sexual assault.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.148
The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes

00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:14.631
on a college campus
take place by serial rapists,

00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:17.209
because outside of the university system,

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:20.227
if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted,

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:24.255
but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity.

00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:26.298
They're not prosecuted.

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:29.642
Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society.

00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:35.214
Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:40.207
is the lack of equal pay for equal work,

00:11:40.207 --> 00:11:42.296
as you know. (Applause)

00:11:42.296 --> 00:11:49.133
And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment,

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:52.480
a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.369
When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent.

00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:59.246
So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president

00:11:59.246 --> 00:12:05.160
and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) --

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.568
but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made,

00:12:08.568 --> 00:12:11.424
so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference

00:12:11.424 --> 00:12:13.699
for the last 15 years.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.627
These are the kind of things that go on.

00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:18.710
If you take the Fortune 500 companies,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.849
23 of them have women CEOs,

00:12:21.849 --> 00:12:23.660
out of 500,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.795
and those CEOs, I need not tell you,

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:28.792
make less on an average

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:31.910
than the other CEOs.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.388
Well, that's what goes on in our country.

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:36.872
Another problem with the United States

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:40.564
is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth.

00:12:40.564 --> 00:12:44.790
We have been to war
with about 25 different countries

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.251
since the Second World War.

00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:49.782
Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting.

00:12:49.782 --> 00:12:51.802
The other times,
we've been flying overhead

00:12:51.802 --> 00:12:53.775
dropping bombs on people.

00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:57.537
Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth.

00:12:57.537 --> 00:13:00.210
We've been at war
with 25 different countries

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.993
or more since the Second World War.

00:13:02.993 --> 00:13:05.370
There was four years,
I won't say which ones,

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.964
where we didn't --

00:13:06.964 --> 00:13:12.722
(Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile,

00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:14.464
we didn't fire a bullet.

00:13:14.464 --> 00:13:18.860
But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.476
and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures

00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:26.770
are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.369
There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention,

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:35.710
and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.751
(Applause)
That's true.

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:43.777
The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls

00:13:43.777 --> 00:13:48.130
quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.570
and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.797
when separate but equal had existed.

00:13:53.797 --> 00:13:59.440
Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.573
from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War,

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:05.417
all the way up to the 1960s,

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:08.134
when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed

00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:10.107
for equal rights.

00:14:10.107 --> 00:14:12.847
But during that time,
there were many white people

00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:16.214
that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay,

00:14:16.214 --> 00:14:18.373
but they stayed quiet,

00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:23.507
because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs,

00:14:23.507 --> 00:14:26.918
unique access to jury duty,

00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:29.169
better schools, and everything else,

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.330
and that's the same thing
that exists today,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.975
because the average man
really doesn't care.

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:41.320
Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women,"

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.770
they enjoy a privileged position.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.142
And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:50.188
who control the university system,

00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:52.852
the majority of men that control
the military system,

00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:56.350
the majority of men that control
the governments of the world,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.584
and the majority of men that control
the great religions.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:04.997
So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today?

00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:07.528
I would say the best thing
that we could do today

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:11.840
is for the women in the powerful nations

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.563
like this one, and where you come from,

00:15:14.563 --> 00:15:19.532
Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act,

00:15:19.532 --> 00:15:24.558
need to take the responsibility
on yourselves

00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:27.623
to be more forceful in demanding

00:15:27.623 --> 00:15:32.265
an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.626
all over the world.

00:15:33.626 --> 00:15:36.527
The average woman in Egypt

00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:38.693
doesn't have much to say
about her daughters

00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:42.101
getting genitally mutilated and so forth.

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:44.175
I didn't even go down
to detail about that.

00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:46.234
But I hope that out of this conference,

00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:50.748
that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize

00:15:50.748 --> 00:15:54.870
that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth

00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:57.411
and in the future job market,

00:15:57.411 --> 00:16:01.860
need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.622
I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren,

00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:09.546
and I think often about them

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:12.611
and about the plight that they
will face in America,

00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:16.396
not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country,

00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:18.602
in having equal rights,

00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:20.935
and I hope that all of you will join me

00:16:20.935 --> 00:16:24.662
in being a champion for women
and girls around the world

00:16:24.662 --> 00:16:26.217
and protect their human rights.

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:29.189
Thank you very much.

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:33.189
(Applause)
