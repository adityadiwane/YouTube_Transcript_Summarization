00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:15.853
I consider it my life's mission

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:19.515
to convey the urgency
of climate change through my work.

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.702
I've traveled north to the Arctic
to the capture the unfolding story

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:25.205
of polar melt,

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:29.141
and south to the Equator to document
the subsequent rising seas.

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:33.593
Most recently, I visited
the icy coast of Greenland

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.483
and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:40.984
connecting two seemingly disparate
but equally endangered

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.475
parts of our planet.

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:49.547
My drawings explore moments
of transition, turbulence

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.285
and tranquility in the landscape,

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.791
allowing viewers to emotionally connect

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:58.530
with a place you might never
have the chance to visit.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:03.579
I choose to convey the beauty
as opposed to the devastation.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.662
If you can experience the sublimity
of these landscapes,

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:12.299
perhaps you'll be inspired
to protect and preserve them.

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:16.912
Behavioral psychology tells us
that we take action

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:21.062
and make decisions based
on our emotions above all else.

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:24.933
And studies have shown
that art impacts our emotions

00:01:24.957 --> 00:01:28.284
more effectively than a scary news report.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.637
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.163
as early as 2020.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.688
And sea levels are likely to rise
between two and ten feet

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:41.038
by century's end.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:47.040
I have dedicated my career
to illuminating these projections

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:49.128
with an accessible medium,

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:53.606
one that moves us in a way
that statistics may not.

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:57.363
My process begins
with traveling to the places

00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:59.686
at the forefront of climate change.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.672
On-site, I take thousands of photographs.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:03.939
Back in the studio,

00:02:03.963 --> 00:02:08.223
I work from both my memory
of the experience and the photographs

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:10.502
to create very large-scale compositions,

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.666
sometimes over 10 feet wide.

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:17.904
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry
like charcoal, but colors.

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:21.754
I consider my work drawings
but others call them painting.

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:26.224
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to
as a "finger painter."

00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:27.366
(Laughter)

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.695
But I don't use any tools

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.196
and I have always used
my fingers and palms

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.646
to manipulate the pigment on the paper.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.576
Drawing is a form of meditation for me.

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:41.981
It quiets my mind.

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:44.244
I don't perceive what I'm drawing

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:45.641
as ice or water.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.127
Instead, the image is stripped down

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.840
to its most basic form of color and shape.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.306
Once the piece is complete,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.466
I can finally experience
the composition as a whole,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.052
as an iceberg floating
through glassy water,

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:02.766
or a wave cresting with foam.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.806
On average, a piece this size
takes me about,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.520
as you can see, 10 seconds.

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:11.324
(Laughter)

00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:14.871
(Applause)

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:19.792
Really, more like 200 hours,
250 hours for something that size.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.798
But I've been drawing ever since
I could hold a crayon, really.

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:24.735
My mom was an artist, and growing up,

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.245
we always had art supplies
all over the house.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.822
My mother's love of photography

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:33.381
propelled her to the most
remote regions of the earth,

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:35.811
and my family and I were fortunate enough

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.536
to join and support her
on these adventures.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.847
We rode camels in Northern Africa

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.918
and mushed on dog sleds
near the North Pole.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:50.067
In August of 2012,
I led my first expedition,

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:54.605
taking a group of artists and scholars
up the northwest coast of Greenland.

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:59.122
My mother was originally
supposed to lead this trip.

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:01.861
She and I were in the early
stages of planning,

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:04.447
as we had intended to go together,

00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:07.146
when she fell victim to a brain tumor.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:11.809
The cancer quickly took over
her body and mind,

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.380
and she passed away six months later.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.095
During the months of her illness, though,

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:22.619
her dedication to the expedition
never wavered, and I made a promise

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:24.508
to carry out her final journey.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:28.517
My mother's passion for the Arctic

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.914
echoed through my experience in Greenland,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.914
and I felt the power

00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:37.488
and the fragility of the landscape.

00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:41.398
The sheer size of the icebergs

00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:42.826
is humbling.

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:46.591
The ice fields are alive
with movement and sound

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:48.752
in a way that I never expected.

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:51.532
I expanded the scale of my compositions

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:56.317
to give you that same sense of awe
that I experienced.

00:04:57.021 --> 00:05:00.716
Yet, while the grandeur
of the ice is evident,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.676
so, too, is its vulnerability.

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:04.257
From our boat,

00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:09.645
I could see the ice sweating
under the unseasonably warm sun.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.503
We had a chance to visit
many of the Inuit communities in Greenland

00:05:14.527 --> 00:05:17.357
that now face huge challenges.

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.697
The locals spoke to me
of vast areas of sea ice

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.407
that are no longer
freezing over as they once did.

00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:26.509
And without ice, their hunting
and harvesting grounds

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:28.295
are severely diminished,

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.160
threatening their way
of life and survival.

00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:34.511
The melting glaciers in Greenland

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:38.879
are one of the largest
contributing factors to rising sea levels,

00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:41.019
which have already begun to drown

00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:43.873
some of our world's lowest-lying islands.

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:48.458
One year after my trip to Greenland,
I visited the Maldives,

00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:52.352
the lowest and flattest country
in the entire world.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:56.785
While I was there, I collected
images and inspiration

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:58.510
for a new body of work:

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:03.105
drawings of waves lapping
on the coast of a nation

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.283
that could be entirely underwater
within this century.

00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:13.027
Devastating events happen every day

00:06:13.051 --> 00:06:16.299
on scales both global and personal.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:18.107
When I was in Greenland,

00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:22.045
I scattered my mother's ashes
amidst the melting ice.

00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:27.830
Now she remains a part
of the landscape she loved so much,

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:31.941
even as it, too, passes
and takes on new form.

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:35.863
Among the many gifts my mother gave me

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.887
was the ability to focus on the positive,

00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:40.434
rather than the negative.

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:47.164
My drawings celebrate the beauty
of what we all stand to lose.

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:53.639
I hope they can serve as records
of sublime landscapes in flux,

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:58.285
documenting the transition
and inspiring our global community

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:00.427
to take action for the future.

00:07:01.102 --> 00:07:02.309
Thank you.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:12.978
(Applause)
