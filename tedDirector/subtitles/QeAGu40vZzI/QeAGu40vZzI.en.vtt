00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.359
I'm going to talk about hackers.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.279
And the image that comes to your mind

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.738
when I say that word is probably not

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:20.255
of Benjamin Franklin,

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:23.443
but I'm going to explain to you why it should be.

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:24.920
The image that comes to your mind

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.606
is probably more likely of a pasty kid

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.122
sitting in a basement doing something mischievous,

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:34.257
or of a shady criminal who is
trying to steal your identity,

00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:37.280
or of an international rogue

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.991
with a political agenda.

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.524
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:49.033
that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.665
But like most things in technology

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:52.114
and the technology world,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:55.289
hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.723
For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.961
there's one that's building a tool

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.092
that will help you find your
loved ones after a disaster

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:06.571
or to monitor environmental quality

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.308
after an oil spill.

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:13.180
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.576
on an existing system,

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.406
and it is a deeply democratic activity.

00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:18.805
It's about critical thinking.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.839
It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:25.227
It's the idea that if you see a 
problem, you work to fix it,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.258
and not just complain about it.

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:31.168
And in many ways, hacking is what built America.

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:33.313
Betsy Ross was a hacker.

00:01:33.313 --> 00:01:36.508
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:39.384
And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:41.923
hacking has always been at the foundation

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:44.975
of American democracy.

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:49.276
So if there's one thing I want
to leave you here with today,

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.847
it's that the next time you
think about who a hacker is,

00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:55.869
you think not of this guy

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.449
but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:01.407
who was one of the greatest hackers of all time.

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:03.548
He was one of America's most prolific inventors,

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:05.730
though he famously never filed a patent,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.324
because he thought that all human knowledge

00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:09.952
should be freely available.

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:12.984
He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:15.181
and of course there was his collaboration

00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.146
on the invention of American democracy.

00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:20.469
And in Code For America, we really try to embody

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.487
the spirit of Ben Franklin.

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:25.929
He was a tinkerer and a statesman

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.789
whose conception of citizenship

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.876
was always predicated on action.

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:32.661
He believed that government could be built

00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:34.301
by the people,

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:38.850
and we call those people civic hackers.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.305
So it's no wonder that the values

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.973
that underly a healthy democracy,

00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:46.966
like collaboration and empowerment

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.029
and participation and enterprise,

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.515
are the same values that underly the Internet.

00:02:52.515 --> 00:02:54.611
And so it's no surprise that many hackers

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.968
are turning their attention to
the problem of government.

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:00.021
But before I give you a few examples

00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.843
of what civic hacking looks like,

00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:03.359
I want to make clear that you don't have

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.453
to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:07.208
You just have to believe that you can bring

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.475
a 21st-century tool set to bear

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.914
on the problems that government faces.

00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:13.959
And we hear all the time from our community

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.247
of civic hackers at Code for America

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.855
that they didn't understand
how much nontechnical work

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.881
actually went into civic hacking projects.

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:22.372
So keep that in mind.

00:03:22.372 --> 00:03:26.462
All of you are potential civic hackers.

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:28.482
So what does civic hacking look like?

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:30.746
Our team last year in Honolulu,

00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:33.361
which in this case was three full-time fellows

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:35.513
who were doing a year of public service,

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:39.478
were asked by the city to rebuild the website.

00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:42.557
And it's a massive thing of
tens of thousands of pages

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:44.673
which just wasn't going to be possible

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.426
in the few months that they had.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.883
So instead, they decided to build a parallel site

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:51.345
that better conformed to how citizens actually

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.684
want to interact with information on a city website.

00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:56.621
They're looking for answers to questions,

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.247
and they want to take action when they're done,

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:01.533
which is really hard to do from a site

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.182
that looks like this.

00:04:03.182 --> 00:04:05.427
So our team built Honolulu Answers,

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.793
which is a super-simple search interface

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:10.246
where you enter a search term or a question

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:12.944
and get back plain language answers

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:15.384
that drive a user towards action.

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:18.241
Now the site itself was easy enough to build,

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:20.144
but the team was faced with the challenge

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:22.854
of how they populate all of the content.

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:24.530
It would have taken the three of them

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.907
a very long time,

00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:28.906
especially given that none of 
them are actually from Honolulu.

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:30.981
And so they did something that's really radical,

00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:32.654
when you think about how government

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:34.695
is used to working.

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:37.707
They asked citizens to write the content.

00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:39.201
So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:40.865
They held a write-a-thon,

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.502
where on one Saturday afternoon --

00:04:43.502 --> 00:04:45.543
("What do I do about wild pigs 
being a nuisance?") (Laughter) â€”

00:04:45.543 --> 00:04:49.589
Wild pigs are a huge problem 
in Honolulu, apparently.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.632
In one Saturday afternoon,

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:53.966
they were able to populate most of the content

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:55.627
for most of the frequently asked questions,

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:57.860
but more importantly than that,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.975
they created a new way for citizens 
to participate in their government.

00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:05.020
Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.357
but it gets more awesome.

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.963
On the National Day of Civic Hacking

00:05:09.963 --> 00:05:12.374
this past June in Oakland, where I live,

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:14.403
the Code For America team in Oakland

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:16.603
took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers

00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:18.614
and turned it into Oakland Answers,

00:05:18.614 --> 00:05:20.693
and again we held a write-a-thon

00:05:20.693 --> 00:05:24.041
where we took the most frequently asked questions

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.703
and had citizens write the answers to them,

00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:27.172
and I got into the act.

00:05:27.172 --> 00:05:30.773
I authored this answer, and a few others.

00:05:30.773 --> 00:05:33.885
And I'm trying to this day to articulate

00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:36.931
the sense of empowerment and responsibility

00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.511
that I feel for the place that I live

00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:44.553
based simply on this small act of participation.

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:48.278
And by stitching together my small act

00:05:48.278 --> 00:05:51.084
with the thousands of other
small acts of participation

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.665
that we're enabling through civic hacking,

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:56.449
we think we can reenergize citizenship

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.499
and restore trust in government.

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:00.836
At this point, you may be wondering

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.562
what city officials think of all this.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.115
They actually love it.

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:06.309
As most of you guys know, cities are being asked

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.030
every day to do more with less,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.228
and they're always looking for innovative solutions

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:12.962
to entrenched problems.

00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:16.496
So when you give citizens a way to participate

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:18.334
beyond attending a town hall meeting,

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.286
cities can actually capture

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:23.040
the capacity in their communities

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.075
to do the business of government.

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:28.068
Now I don't want to leave the impression

00:06:28.068 --> 00:06:30.180
that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.883
It's happening across the globe,

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:33.536
and one of my favorite examples

00:06:33.536 --> 00:06:35.967
is from Mexico City, where earlier this year,

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.077
the Mexico House of Representatives

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:42.389
entered into a contract with
a software development firm

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.569
to build an app that legislators would use

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.820
to track bills.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.496
So this was just for the handful of legislators

00:06:49.496 --> 00:06:52.070
in the House.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.739
And the contract was a two-year contract

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:58.665
for 9.3 million dollars.

00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.017
Now a lot of people were really angry about this,

00:07:01.017 --> 00:07:03.964
especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:06.268
was an absolutely outrageous amount of money

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:08.239
for what was a very simple app.

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:10.668
But instead of taking to the streets,

00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:12.876
they issued a challenge.

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:15.707
They asked programmers in Mexico

00:07:15.707 --> 00:07:18.910
to build something better and cheaper,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.361
and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --

00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.262
10,000 times cheaper

00:07:25.262 --> 00:07:26.910
than the government contract,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.013
and they gave the entrants 10 days.

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:31.825
And in those 10 days,

00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:35.886
they submitted 173 apps,

00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:38.520
five of which were presented to Congress

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.621
and are still in the app store today.

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:42.442
And because of this action,

00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:44.570
that contract was vacated,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.702
and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City

00:07:46.702 --> 00:07:48.459
which is home to one of our partners,

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:50.917
Code for Mexico City.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:53.668
And so what you see in all three of these places,

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.485
in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,

00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:59.676
are the elements that are
at the core of civic hacking.

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:02.699
It's citizens who saw things
that could be working better

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.630
and they decided to fix them,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.289
and through that work, they're creating

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:09.480
a 21st-century ecosystem of participation.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.510
They're creating a whole new set of ways

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.516
for citizens to be involved,

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:17.461
besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:21.438
They can actually build government.

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:24.574
So back to our friend Ben Franklin,

00:08:24.574 --> 00:08:27.320
who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.195
was that in 1736 he founded

00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:34.753
the first volunteer firefighting
company in Philadelphia,

00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:36.452
called a brigade.

00:08:36.452 --> 00:08:38.678
And it's because he and his friends noticed

00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:40.377
that the city was having trouble keeping up

00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:42.447
with all the fires that were happening in the city,

00:08:42.447 --> 00:08:45.236
so in true civic hacker fashion,

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:47.886
they built a solution.

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:50.396
And we have our own brigades at Code for America

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.542
working on the projects that I've just described,

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.280
and we want to ask you

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.742
to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps

00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:59.209
and come join us.

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:01.499
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.767
We are pleased to announce today

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:05.043
that we're opening up the 
brigade to international cities

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:06.635
for the first time,

00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:10.616
starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.715
You can find out if there's a brigade where you live

00:09:12.715 --> 00:09:15.209
at brigade.codeforamerica.org,

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:17.648
and if there's not a brigade
where you live, we will help you.

00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:19.504
We've created a tool kit which also lives

00:09:19.504 --> 00:09:21.068
at brigade.codeforamerica.org,

00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:23.608
and we will support you along the way.

00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:27.523
Our goal is to create a global
network of civic hackers

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:30.276
who are innovating on the existing system

00:09:30.276 --> 00:09:33.236
in order to build tools that will solve

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:35.102
entrenched problems,

00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:37.129
that will support local government,

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:38.688
and that will empower citizens.

00:09:38.688 --> 00:09:41.063
So please come hack with us.

00:09:41.063 --> 00:09:42.611
Thank you.

00:09:42.611 --> 00:09:45.161
(Applause)
