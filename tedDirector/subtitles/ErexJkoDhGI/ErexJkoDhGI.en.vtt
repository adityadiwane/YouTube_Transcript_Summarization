00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.776
I do want to test this question
we're all interested in:

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.816
Does extinction have to be forever?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.536
I'm focused on two projects
I want to tell you about.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.376
One is the Thylacine Project.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.162
The other one is the Lazarus Project,

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.896
and that's focused
on the gastric-brooding frog.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.816
And it would be a fair question to ask,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.096
why have we focused on these two animals?

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.496
Well, point number one, each of them
represents a unique family of its own.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.096
We've lost a whole family.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.736
That's a big chunk
of the global genome gone.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.336
I'd like it back.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.696
The second reason
is that we killed these things.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.656
In the case of the thylacine, regrettably,
we shot every one that we saw.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.116
We slaughtered them.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.696
In the case of the gastric-brooding frog,
we may have "fungicided" it to death.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.416
There's a dreadful fungus
that's moving through the world

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.056
that's called the chytrid fungus,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.296
and it's nailing frogs all over the world.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.368
We think that's probably
what got this frog,

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:10.776
and humans are spreading this fungus.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.656
And this introduces
a very important ethical point,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.896
and I think you will have heard
this many times

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.536
when this topic comes up.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.296
What I think is important

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.896
is that, if it's clear
that we exterminated these species,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.336
then I think we not only
have a moral obligation

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.837
to see what we can do about it,

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:32.011
but I think we've got a moral imperative
to try to do something, if we can.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.576
OK. Let me talk to you
about the Lazarus Project.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.456
It's a frog. And you think, frog.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.856
Yeah, but this was not just any frog.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.656
Unlike a normal frog,
which lays its eggs in the water

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.336
and goes away
and wishes its froglets well,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.976
this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.656
swallowed them into the stomach,
where it should be having food,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.176
didn't digest the eggs,
and turned its stomach into a uterus.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.536
In the stomach, the eggs
went on to develop into tadpoles,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.416
and in the stomach, the tadpoles
went on to develop into frogs,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.096
and they grew in the stomach

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.136
until eventually the poor old frog
was at risk of bursting apart.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.216
It has a little cough and a hiccup,
and out comes sprays of little frogs.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.976
Now, when biologists saw this,
they were agog.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.936
They thought, this is incredible.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.776
No animal, let alone a frog,
has been known to do this,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.936
to change one organ
in the body into another.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.776
And you can imagine the medical world
went nuts over this as well.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.016
If we could understand

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.336
how that frog is managing
the way its tummy works,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.816
is there information here
that we need to understand

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.176
or could usefully use to help ourselves?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.536
Now, I'm not suggesting we want
to raise our babies in our stomach,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.176
but I am suggesting it's possible

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.856
we might want to manage
gastric secretion in the gut.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.696
And just as everybody
got excited about it, bang!

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.920
It was extinct.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.576
I called up my friend,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.981
Professor Mike Tyler
in the University of Adelaide.

00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:02.376
He was the last person who had this frog,
a colony of these things, in his lab.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.448
And I said, "Mike, by any chance --"
This was 30 or 40 years ago.

00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:09.216
"By any chance had you kept
any frozen tissue of this frog?"

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.456
And he thought about it,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.296
and he went to his deep freezer,
minus 20 degrees centigrade,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.576
and he poured through
everything in the freezer,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.896
and there in the bottom was a jar
and it contained tissues of these frogs.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.176
This was very exciting,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.536
but there was no reason
why we should expect that this would work,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.496
because this tissue
had not had any antifreeze put in it,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.176
cryoprotectants, to look after it
when it was frozen.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.936
And normally, when water freezes,
as you know, it expands,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.776
and the same thing happens in a cell.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.176
If you freeze tissues, the water expands,
damages or bursts the cell walls.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.616
Well, we looked at the tissue
under the microscope.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.376
It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.026
So we thought, let's give it a go.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.736
What we did is something called
somatic cell nuclear transplantation.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.376
We took the eggs
of a related species, a living frog,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.256
and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.696
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.456
And then we took the dead nucleus
from the dead tissue of the extinct frog

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.576
and we inserted those nuclei
into that egg.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.056
Now, by rights, this is
kind of like a cloning project,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.296
like what produced Dolly,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.936
but it's actually very different,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.696
because Dolly was live sheep
into live sheep cells.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.056
That was a miracle, but it was workable.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.736
What we're trying to do is take
a dead nucleus from an extinct species

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.136
and put it into a completely different
species and expect that to work.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.456
Well, we had no real reason
to expect it would,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.130
and we tried hundreds
and hundreds of these.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.576
And just last February,
the last time we did these trials,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.440
I saw a miracle starting to happen.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.336
What we found was
most of these eggs didn't work,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.336
but then suddenly,
one of them began to divide.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.736
That was so exciting.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.656
And then the egg divided again.
And then again.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.696
And pretty soon,
we had early-stage embryos

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.496
with hundreds of cells forming those.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.296
We even DNA-tested some of these cells,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.136
and the DNA of the extinct frog
is in those cells.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.656
So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.416
But it's a long way along the journey

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.256
to producing, or bringing back,
an extinct species.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.496
And this is news.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.976
We haven't announced this publicly before.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.216
We're excited.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.856
We've got to get past this point.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.404
We now want this ball of cells
to start to gastrulate,

00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:25.056
to turn in so that it will produce
the other tissues.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.776
It'll go on and produce
a tadpole and then a frog.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.016
Watch this space.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.233
I think we're going to have
this frog hopping

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:33.976
glad to be back in the world again.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.536
(Applause)

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.766
Thank you.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.896
(Applause)

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.578
We haven't done it yet,
but keep the applause ready.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.056
The second project I want to talk
to you about is the Thylacine Project.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.936
The thylacine looks a bit,
to most people, like a dog,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.103
or maybe like a tiger,
because it has stripes.

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:55.936
But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.136
It raised its young in a pouch,
like a koala or a kangaroo would do,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.176
and it has a long history,
a long, fascinating history,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.096
that goes back 25 million years.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.735
But it's also a tragic history.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.136
The first one that we see occurs
in the ancient rain forests of Australia

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.136
about 25 million years ago,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.496
and the National Geographic Society

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.751
is helping us to explore
these fossil deposits.

00:06:21.775 --> 00:06:23.296
This is Riversleigh.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.376
In those fossil rocks
are some amazing animals.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.296
We found marsupial lions.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.896
We found carnivorous kangaroos.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.376
It's not what you usually
think about as a kangaroo,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.136
but these are meat-eating kangaroos.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.056
We found the biggest bird in the world,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.223
bigger than that thing
that was in Madagascar,

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:40.736
and it too was a flesh eater.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.016
It was a giant, weird duck.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.936
And crocodiles were not behaving
at that time either.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.336
You think of crocodiles
as doing their ugly thing,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.776
sitting in a pool of water.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.336
These crocodiles
were actually out on the land

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.576
and they were even climbing trees
and jumping on prey on the ground.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.751
We had, in Australia, drop crocs.
They really do exist.

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:02.874
(Laughter)

00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:05.916
But what they were dropping on
was not only other weird animals

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.216
but also thylacines.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.176
There were five different kinds
of thylacines in those ancient forests,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.656
and they ranged from great big ones
to middle-sized ones

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.416
to one that was
about the size of a chihuahua.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.056
Paris Hilton would have been able

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.736
to carry one of these things around
in a little handbag,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.536
until a drop croc landed on her.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.496
At any rate, it was a fascinating place,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.296
but unfortunately,
Australia didn't stay this way.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.816
Climate change has affected the world
for a long period of time,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.256
and gradually, the forests disappeared,
the country began to dry out,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.896
and the number of kinds
of thylacines began to decline,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.496
until by five million years ago,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.696
only one left.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.256
By 10,000 years ago,
they had disappeared from New Guinea,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.136
and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago,
somebodies, we don't know who this was,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.896
introduced dingoes --
this is a very archaic kind of a dog&nbsp;--

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.136
into Australia.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.376
And as you can see,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.216
dingoes are very similar
in their body form to thylacines.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.176
That similarity meant
they probably competed.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.176
They were eating the same kinds of foods.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.816
It's even possible that aborigines were
keeping some of these dingoes as pets,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.276
and therefore they may have had
an advantage in the battle for survival.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.916
All we know is, soon after
the dingoes were brought in,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.356
thylacines were extinct
in the Australian mainland,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.858
and after that they only
survived in Tasmania.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.696
Then, unfortunately,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.256
the next sad part of the thylacine story
is that Europeans arrived in 1788,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.056
and they brought with them
the things they valued,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.760
and that included sheep.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.896
They took one look
at the thylacine in Tasmania,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.016
and they thought, hang on,
this is not going to work.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.287
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.

00:08:44.938 --> 00:08:47.176
That was not what happened, actually.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.775
Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep,
but the thylacine got a bad rap.

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:54.775
But immediately, the government said,
that's it, let's get rid of them,

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:58.052
and they paid people
to slaughter every one that they saw.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.896
By the early 1930s,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.736
3,000 to 4,000 thylacines
had been murdered.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.125
It was a disaster,
and they were about to hit the wall.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.536
Have a look at this bit of film footage.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.296
It makes me very sad because,
while it's a fascinating animal,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.376
and it's amazing to think
that we had the technology to film it

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.456
before it actually plunged off
that cliff of extinction,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.096
we didn't, unfortunately,
at this same time,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.176
have a molecule of concern
about the welfare for this species.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.576
These are photos of the last
surviving thylacine, Benjamin,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.899
who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.296
To add insult to injury,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.016
having swept this species
nearly off the table,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.536
this animal, when it died of neglect --

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.541
The keepers didn't let it
into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.936
It died of exposure, and in the morning,
when they found the body of Benjamin,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.938
they still cared so little for this animal
that they threw the body in the dump.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.520
Does it have to stay this way?

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.096
In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.856
I was fascinated by thylacines.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.976
I've always been obsessed
with these animals.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.256
And I was studying skulls,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.536
trying to figure out their relationships
to other sorts of animals,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.536
and I saw this jar,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.096
and here, in the jar,
was a little girl thylacine pup,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.816
perhaps six months old.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.176
The guy who had found it
and killed the mother

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.336
had pickled the pup,
and they pickled it in alcohol.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.976
I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew
alcohol was a DNA preservative.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.336
But this was 1990,
and I asked my geneticist friends,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.776
couldn't we think
about going into this pup

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.776
and extracting DNA, if it's there,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.016
and then somewhere
down the line in the future,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.256
we'll use this DNA
to bring the thylacine back?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.035
The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.538
Cloning was science fiction.

00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:53.796
It had not happened.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.216
But then suddenly cloning did happen.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.376
And I thought, when I became
director of the Australian Museum,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.736
I'm going to give this a go.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.216
I put a team together.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.096
We went into that pup
to see what was in it,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.296
and we did find thylacine DNA.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.496
It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.216
Unfortunately, we also found
a lot of human DNA.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.216
Every old curator
who'd been in that museum

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.096
had seen this wonderful specimen,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.616
put their hand in the jar,
pulled it out and thought,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.176
"Wow, look at that,"
plop, dropped it back in the jar,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.776
contaminating this specimen.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.096
And that was a worry.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.336
If the goal here was to get the DNA out

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.296
and use the DNA down the track
to try to bring a thylacine back,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.736
what we didn't want happening

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.016
when the information
was shoved into the machine

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.456
and the wheel turned around
and the lights flashed,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.456
was to have a wizened old horrible curator
pop out the other end of the machine.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.176
It would've kept the curator very happy,
but it wasn't going to keep us happy.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.256
So we went back to these specimens
and we started digging around,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.416
and particularly,
we looked into the teeth of skulls,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.496
hard parts where humans
had not been able to get their fingers,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.464
and we found much better quality DNA.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.176
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.696
It's there. So we got it.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.176
OK. What could we do with this stuff?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.396
Well, George Church,
in his book, "Regenesis,"

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.456
has mentioned many of the techniques
that are rapidly advancing

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.094
to work with fragmented DNA.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.136
We would hope that we'll be able
to get that DNA back into a viable form,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.816
and then, much like we've done
with the Lazarus Project,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.896
get that stuff into an egg
of a host species.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.336
It has to be a different species.
What could it be?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.136
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.226
They're related, distantly, to thylacines.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.450
And then the Tasmanian devil is going
to pop a thylacine out the south end.

00:12:33.164 --> 00:12:36.176
Critics of this project say, hang on.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.807
Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?
That's going to hurt.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.176
No, it's not. These are marsupials.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.056
They give birth to babies
that are the size of a jelly bean.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.456
That Tasmanian devil's
not even going to know it gave birth.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.936
It is, shortly, going to think

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.056
it's got the ugliest
Tasmanian devil baby in the world,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.993
so maybe it'll need some help
to keep it going.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.696
Andrew Pask and his colleagues
have demonstrated

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.576
this might not be a waste of time.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.296
And it's sort of in the future,
we haven't got there yet,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.696
but it's the kind of thing
we want to think about.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.256
They took some of this same
pickled thylacine DNA

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.576
and they spliced it into a mouse genome,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.096
but they put a tag on it

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.096
so that anything
that this thylacine DNA produced

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.976
would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.136
In other words, if thylacine tissues
were being produced by the thylacine DNA,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.056
it would be able to be recognized.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.096
When the baby popped up,
it was filled with blue-green tissues.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.896
And that tells us if we can get
that genome back together,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.376
get it into a live cell,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.894
it's going to produce thylacine stuff.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.976
Is this a risk?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.936
You've taken the bits of one animal

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.207
and you've mixed them into the cell
of a different kind of an animal.

00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:50.336
Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.616
And the answer is no.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.376
If the only nuclear DNA that goes
into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.570
that's the only thing that can pop out
the other end of the devil.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.016
OK, if we can do this,
could we put it back?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.816
This is a key question for everybody.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.576
Does it have to stay in a laboratory,
or could we put it back where it belongs?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.976
Could we put it back in the throne
of the king of beasts in Tasmania,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.496
restore that ecosystem?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.429
Or has Tasmania changed so much
that that's no longer possible?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.776
I've been to Tasmania.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.816
I've been to many of the areas
where the thylacines were common.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.696
I've even spoken to people,
like Peter Carter here,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.976
who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.856
but in 1926, this man
and his father and his brother

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.256
caught thylacines.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.616
They trapped them.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.936
And when I spoke to this man,
I was looking in his eyes and thinking,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:46.136
"Behind those eyes is a brain that has
memories of what thylacines feel like,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.616
what they smelled like,
what they sounded like."

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.176
He led them around on a rope.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.256
He has personal experiences

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.499
that I would give my left leg
to have in my head.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.296
We'd all love to have
this sort of thing happen.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.576
Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.336
could he take us back
to where he caught those thylacines.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.976
My interest was in whether
the environment had changed.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.776
He thought hard. It was nearly 80 years
before this that he'd been at this hut.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.056
At any rate, he led us
down this bush track,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.056
and there, right where he remembered,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.336
was the hut,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.816
and tears came into his eyes.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.656
He looked at the hut. We went inside.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.136
There were the wooden boards
on the sides of the hut

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.936
where he and his father
and his brother had slept at night.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.616
And he told me, as it all
was flooding back in memories.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.296
He said, "I remember
the thylacines going around the hut

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.656
wondering what was inside,"

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.176
and he said they made sounds
like "Yip! Yip! Yip!"

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.416
All of these are parts of his life
and what he remembers.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.856
And the key question for me
was to ask Peter, has it changed?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.096
And he said no.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.256
The southern beech forests
surrounded his hut

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.616
just like it was
when he was there in 1926.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.616
The grasslands were sweeping away.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.616
That's classic thylacine habitat.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.496
And the animals in those areas
were the same that were there

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.976
when the thylacine was around.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.520
So could we put it back? Yes.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.256
Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.536
Sometimes you might
be able to put it back,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.776
but is that the safest way
to make sure it never goes extinct again?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.336
And I don't think so.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.656
I think gradually, as we see species
all around the world,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.456
it's kind of a mantra that wildlife
is increasingly not safe in the wild.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.671
We'd love to think it is,
but we know it isn't.

00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:21.096
We need other parallel
strategies coming online.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.616
And this one interests me.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.362
Some of the thylacines
that were being turned in to zoos,

00:16:25.386 --> 00:16:27.136
sanctuaries, even at the museums,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.005
had collar marks on the neck.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.416
They were being kept as pets,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.416
and we know a lot
of bush tales and memories

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.976
of people who had them as pets,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.176
and they say they were
wonderful, friendly.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.416
This particular one

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.416
came in out of the forest to lick this boy

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.050
and curled up around
the fireplace to go to sleep.

00:16:45.074 --> 00:16:46.456
A wild animal.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.776
And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.256
If it had not been illegal
to keep these thylacines as pets then,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.456
would the thylacine be extinct now?

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.216
And I'm positive it wouldn't.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.732
We need to think
about this in today's world.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.776
Could it be that getting animals
close to us so that we value them,

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.176
maybe they won't go extinct?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.736
And this is such a critical issue for us

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.096
because if we don't do that,

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.256
we're going to watch more of these animals
plunge off the precipice.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.496
As far as I'm concerned,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.656
this is why we're trying to do
these kinds of de-extinction projects.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.736
We are trying to restore
that balance of nature

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.325
that we have upset.

00:17:27.793 --> 00:17:28.976
Thank you.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.720
(Applause)
