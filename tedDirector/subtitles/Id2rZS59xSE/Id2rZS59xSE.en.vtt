00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm a medical illustrator,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I come from a slightly different point of view.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I've been watching, since I grew up,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and truth and beauty in the sciences.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
they both have very wonderful things going for them --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that a scientist would want to date.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by meaning they are things you can worship.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They are unique. They are useful --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
sometimes, often a long time after the fact.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Truth and beauty are things

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
They are things that describe beauty in a way

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that is often only accessible if you understand the language

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and the syntax of the person

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If you look at the math, E=mc squared,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
if you look at the cosmological constant,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
from the numbers that describe the universe --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
these are things that are really difficult to understand.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And what I've tried to do

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
since I was taught animation by my father,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I wanted to figure out a way to help people

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Students today are often immersed in an environment

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are not always evident.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We don't want to do that to our students.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
would be interested and willing to really change

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that would explore the truth and beauty inherent

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in molecular and cellular biology

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
so that students could understand a larger picture

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that they could hang all of these facts on.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They could have a mental image of the cell

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that's occupied by micro-machines.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
These micro-machines,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that are made out of strings of amino acids.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They power our minds.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
how we could make this story into an animation

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which is a website that Harvard has

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for its molecular and cellular biology students

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
in addition to all the didactic stuff --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
put everything together visually, so that these students

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so that their passions would be sparked

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and so that they would be able to go on

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that are streaming down a capillary,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and they're picking up information from cells

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
where they can't see and sense.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But they get the information that causes them to stop,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
causes them to internalize that they need to make

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So these molecular motors -- we had to work

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
with the Harvard scientists and databank models

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of the atomically accurate molecules

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And figure out how to do this in a way

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
would prevent the vista from happening.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that we produced. It's an ongoing project

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that's going to go another four or five years.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And I want you to look at this

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and see the paths that the cell manufactures --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that take these huge loads

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that would challenge an ant in relative size.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Run the movie, please.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But these machines that power the inside of the cells

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
because all of these machines interact with each other.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
They pass information to each other.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
on the fly, from information

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
would be possible without these little micro-machines.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.000
(Music)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This little guy is called the kinesin,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to wherever it's needed in the cell --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
whether it's to build something or repair something.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
running around, right now,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So no matter how lazy you feel,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
(Laughter)

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So what I want you to do when you go home

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And think about some of the things

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that we're learning about cellular mechanics.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Once we figure out all that's going on --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
once we figure out what's going on,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
over what we do with our health,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
with what we do with future generations,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and how long we're going to live.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And hopefully we'll be able to use this

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to discover more truth, and more beauty.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Music)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And their working together helps our bodies --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)
