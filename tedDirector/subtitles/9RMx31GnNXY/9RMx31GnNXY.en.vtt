00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
There's actually a major health crisis today

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
in terms of the shortage of organs.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
The fact is that we're living longer.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Medicine has done a much better job

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
of making us live longer,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
and the problem is, as we age,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
our organs tend to fail more,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and so currently

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
there are not enough organs to go around.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
In fact, in the last 10 years,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
while in the same time,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
So this is now a public health crisis.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
So that's where this field comes in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that we call the field of regenerative medicine.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
It really involves many different areas.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
You can use, actually, scaffolds,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
biomaterials --

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
but specific materials you can actually implant in patients

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and they will do well and help you regenerate.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
Or we can use cells alone,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
either your very own cells

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
or different stem cell populations.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Or we can use both.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
We can use, actually, biomaterials

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
and the cells together.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And that's where the field is today.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
But it's actually not a new field.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Interestingly, this is a book

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
that was published back in 1938.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
He actually devised some of the same technologies

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
used today for suturing blood vessels,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
were actually designed by Alexis.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
But I want you to note his co-author:

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Charles Lindbergh.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
That's the same Charles Lindbergh

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
who actually spent the rest of his life

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
working with Alexis

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
at the Rockefeller Institute in New York

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
in the area of the culture of organs.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So if the field's been around for so long,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
why so few clinical advances?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And that really has to do to many different challenges.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
But if I were to point to three challenges,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
the first one is actually the design of materials

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that could go in your body

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and do well over time.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
And many advances now,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
we can do that fairly readily.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
The second challenge was cells.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
Plus we have stem cells.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
But even now, 2011,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.260
there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
we still can't grow them even today.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And the third challenge is vascularity,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
the actual supply of blood

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
to allow those organs or tissues to survive

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
once we regenerate them.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So we can actually use biomaterials now.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
This is actually a biomaterial.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
This is actually like a cotton candy machine.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
You saw the spray going in.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
creating this structure, this tubularized structure,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
which is a biomaterial

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
that we can then use

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
to help your body regenerate

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
using your very own cells to do so.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And that's exactly what we did here.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
This is actually a patient

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
who [was] presented with a deceased organ,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and we then created one of these smart biomaterials,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and then we then used that smart biomaterial

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
to replace and repair

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
that patient's structure.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
What we did was we actually

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
used the biomaterial as a bridge

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
so that the cells in the organ

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
could walk on that bridge, if you will,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
and help to bridge the gap

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
to regenerate that tissue.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And you see that patient now six months after

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
which is fully regenerated

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
when you analyze it under the microscope.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
We can also use cells alone.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
These are actually cells that we obtained.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
These are stem cells that we create from specific sources,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and we can drive them to become heart cells,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and they start beating in culture.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So they know what to do.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
The cells genetically know what to do,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
and they start beating together.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Now today, many clinical trials

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
are using different kinds of stem cells

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
for heart disease.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
So that's actually now in patients.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Or if we're going to use larger structures

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
to replace larger structures,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
we can then use the patient's own cells,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
or some cell population,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and the biomaterials,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
the scaffolds, together.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
So the concept here:

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
so if you do have a deceased or injured organ,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
we take a very small piece of that tissue,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
We then tease the cells apart,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
we grow the cells outside the body.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
we then shape that material,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and we then use those cells to coat that material

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
one layer at a time --

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
We then place it in an oven-like device,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
and we're able to create that structure

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
and bring it out.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
This is actually a heart valve

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
that we've engineered,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and we've seeded that with cells,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and then we exercise it.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
So you see the leaflets opening and closing --

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
of this heart valve

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.260
that's currently being used experimentally

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
to try to get it to further studies.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
Another technology

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that we have used in patients

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
actually involves bladders.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
We then grow the cells outside the body,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the patient's own cells, two different cell types.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
We then put it in this oven-like device.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
It has the same conditions as the human body --

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that we're able to implant back into the patient.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
but we actually created these biomaterials by hand.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
But we now have better ways

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
to create these structures with the cells.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
We use now some type of technologies,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
where for solid organs, for example,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
like the liver,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
what we do is we take discard livers.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
So we can take these liver structures,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
which are not going to be used,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
that will allow the cells to be washed away.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
Two weeks later,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
you have something that looks like a liver.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
You can hold it like a liver,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
preserving the blood vessel tree.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
with the patient's own blood vessel cells,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
And we now have been able just to show

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the creation of human liver tissue

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
just this past month

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
using this technology.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
Another technology that we've used

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
is actually that of printing.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
but instead of using ink,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
we're using cells.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And you can actually see here the printhead

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
going through and printing this structure,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
And there's a 3D elevator

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
that then actually goes down one layer at a time

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
each time the printhead goes through.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And then finally you're able to get that structure out.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And this is actually a piece of bone

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
that I'm going to show you in this slide

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
that was actually created with this desktop printer

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and implanted as you see here.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
That was all new bone that was implanted

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
using these techniques.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
our next generation of technologies,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
are more sophisticated printers.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
This particular printer we're designing now

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
is actually one where we print right on the patient.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
So what you see here --

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
I know it sounds funny,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
but that's the way it works.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Because in reality, what you want to do

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
and you have a scanner,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
basically like a flatbed scanner.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
That's what you see here on the right side.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
You see a scanner technology

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that first scans the wound on the patient

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
and then it comes back with the printheads

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
actually printing the layers that you require

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
on the patients themselves.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
This is how it actually works.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
Here's the scanner going through,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
scanning the wound.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
Once it's scanned,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
it sends information in the correct layers of cells

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
where they need to be.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
And now you're going to see here

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
a demo of this actually being done

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
in a representative wound.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So once those cells are on the patient

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
they will stick where they need to be.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And this is actually new technology

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
still under development.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
We're also working on more sophisticated printers.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Because in reality, our biggest challenge

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
are the solid organs.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
I don't know if you realize this,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.260
but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
are actually waiting for a kidney.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Patients are dying every day

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
because we don't have enough of those organs to go around.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
So this is more challenging --

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
large organ, vascular,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
a lot of blood vessel supply,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
a lot of cells present.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
So the strategy here is --

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
and we go layer by layer,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
using computerized morphometric imaging analysis

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
and 3D reconstruction

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
to get right down to those patient's own kidneys.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
We then are able to actually image those,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
do 360 degree rotation

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
to analyze the kidney

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.260
in its full volumetric characteristics,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
and we then are able

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
to actually take this information

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and then scan this

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
in a printing computerized form.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So we go layer by layer through the organ,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
analyzing each layer as we go through the organ,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and we then are able to send that information, as you see here,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
through the computer

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.260
and actually design the organ

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
for the patient.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.260
This actually shows the actual printer.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
And this actually shows that printing.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.260
In fact, we actually have the printer right here.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
So while we've been talking today,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
you can actually see the printer

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
back here in the back stage.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
That's actually the actual printer right now,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
and that's been printing this kidney structure

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
that you see here.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
It takes about seven hours to print a kidney,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
so this is about three hours into it now.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
that we printed a little bit earlier today.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
Put a pair of gloves here.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Thank you.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Go backwards.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
You can actually see that kidney

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
as it was printed earlier today.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:59.260
(Applause)

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Has a little bit of consistency to it.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and part of our team.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.260
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.260
(Applause)

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
So this is actually a new generation.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.260
In reality, we now have a long history of doing this.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
I'm going to share with you a clip

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
And this is actually a very brief clip --

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
only about 30 seconds --

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
of a patient who actually received an organ.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
I couldn't go out

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
and play basketball at recess

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
without feeling like I was going to pass out

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
when I got back inside.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
I felt so sick.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
if I was on that.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
So after the surgery,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
life got a lot better for me.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
I was able to do more things.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I was able to wrestle in high school.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
I became the captain of the team, and that was great.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
it's going to be with me.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
I've got it for life, so I'm all set.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:14:03.260
(Applause)

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and it's very cool when they do.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
Luke, come up please.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:29.260
(Applause)

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
So Luke, before last night,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
when's the last time you saw Tony?

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
and it's really great to see him.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
(Laughter)

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:46.260
(Applause)

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.260
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
and basically trying to live life like a normal kid,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
which I always wanted growing up.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
and my kidneys and bladder weren't working.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
I went through about 16 surgeries,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
and it seemed impossible to do that

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
when I was in kidney failure when I was 10.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And this surgery came along

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
and basically made me who I am today

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and saved my life.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:29.260
(Applause)

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
and coming up with crazy stuff.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
I was a little kid, and I was like,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
(Laughter)

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
All I wanted to do was to get better,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and I see the amazing things that he's doing.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
JE: When you got this call out of the blue --

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Tony's really shy,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
and it took a lot of convincing

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
to get somebody as modest as Tony

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
to allow us to bring Luke.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
So Luke, you go to your communications professors --

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
you're majoring in communications --

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
and you ask them for permission to come to TED,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
which might have a little bit to do with communications,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
and what was their reaction?

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
LM: Most of my professors were all for it,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
and they said, "Bring pictures

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
There were a couple that were a little stubborn,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
but I had to talk to them.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
I pulled them aside.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
JE: Thank you, Tony.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
(Applause)
