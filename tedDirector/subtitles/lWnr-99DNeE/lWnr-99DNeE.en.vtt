00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.396
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.636
Mars is a very cold planet,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.916
flooded with high levels of UV radiation

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.836
and extremely dry.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.980
In fact, Mars is considered
to be too dry for life as we know it.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.996
I'm an astrobiologist.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.916
I try to understand
the origin of life on Earth

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.156
and the possibilities of finding life

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.420
elsewhere in the universe.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.476
People sometimes ask me,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.676
how can you be an astrobiologist

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.500
if you don't have your own spaceship?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.676
Well, what I do is that I study life

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.676
in those environments on Earth

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.020
that most closely resemble
other interesting places in the universe.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.396
All life on Earth requires water,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.956
so in my case I focus
on the intimate relationship

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.476
between water and life

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.076
in order to understand

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.340
if we could find life
in a planet as dry as Mars.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.796
But since I do not have
the 2.5 billion dollars

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.036
to send my own robot to Mars,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.996
I study the most Martian place on Earth,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.556
the Atacama Desert.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.236
Located in northern Chile,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.876
it is the oldest
and driest desert on Earth.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.876
To give you an idea of how dry it is,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.940
consider here in Vancouver it rains
over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.316
In the Atacama, there are places
with no reported rains

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.140
in the last 400 years.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.396
How do I know this?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.916
Well, because I was born
and raised in the Atacama --

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.556
(Laughter)

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.596
So I had a unique advantage

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.660
when I started studying this desert.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.236
So let me tell you guys
a few fantastic examples

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.916
he has found

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.140
on how life has adapted
to live with almost no water at all.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.036
One of my first findings
was in the entrance of a cave

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.796
facing the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.516
In this place, we reported
a new type of microalgae

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.460
that grew only on top of the spiderwebs
that covered the cave entrance.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.580
Have you ever seen a spiderweb
early in the morning?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.596
It's covered with dew,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.876
so this microalgae learned
that in order to carry photosynthesis

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.916
in the coast of the driest
desert on Earth,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.436
they could use the spiderwebs.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.876
So here they may access
the water from the fogs

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.140
that regularly cover
these areas in the morning.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.300
In another cave, we found
a different type of microalgae.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.156
This one is able to use ocean mist
as a source of water,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.316
and strikingly lives
in the very bottom of a cave,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.556
so it has adapted to live
with less than 0.1 percent

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.700
of the amount of light
that regular plants need.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.836
These type of findings
suggest to me that on Mars,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.716
we may find even
photosynthetic life inside caves.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.116
And by the way, that's me.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.956
(Laughter)

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.716
Now, for almost 15 years
this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.756
was thought to be
the driest place of this desert,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.516
but I knew that it was not.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.916
How? You already know the answer.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.156
Because I was born
and raised in this desert.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.836
So I remembered that I
usually see fogs in Yungay,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.076
so after setting sensors
in a number of places,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.156
where I remember
never seeing fogs or clouds,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.196
I reported four other sites
much drier than Yungay,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.836
with this one, MarÃ­a Elena South,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.316
being the truly driest place on Earth,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.316
as dry as Mars,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.676
and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.980
from the small mining town
where I was born.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.236
Now, in this search, we were trying
to actually find the dry limit

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.476
for life on Earth,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.356
a place so dry that nothing
was able to survive in it.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.956
But even here, well hidden underground,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.396
we found a number
of different microorganisms,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.876
which suggested to me
that similarly dry places, like Mars,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.100
may be in inhabited.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.476
We even have some preliminary evidences

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.036
that these microorganisms
may still be active

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.996
in the desiccated state,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.836
like walking mummies all around us,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.980
and that they may be using
UV radiation as a source of energy.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.276
If confirmed, this would have
a huge impact on our definition of life,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.820
on how we look for life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.596
Due to its clear skies, by 2020,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.276
60 percent of the biggest
telescopes on Earth

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.516
will be located in the Atacama,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.436
and while everyone else
will be looking among the stars

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.700
to answer the question, "Are we alone?"

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.516
I will be looking down to the ground

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.116
searching for this same answer

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.340
in my own backyard.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.996
Thank you.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.180
(Applause)
