00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.604
Ichthyology,

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:16.088
the study of fishes.

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:18.970
It looks like a big, boring word,

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:21.175
but it's actually quite exciting,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.172
because ichthyology is the only "ology"

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.527
with "YOLO" in it.

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.335
(Laughter)

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.185
Now, to the cool kids in the audience,

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:33.386
you already know, YOLO stands for
"you only live once,"

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.072
and because I only have one life,

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.859
I'm going to spend it doing
what I always dreamt of doing:

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:41.043
seeing the hidden wonders of the world
and discovering new species.

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:42.566
And that's what I get to do.

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:47.328
Now, in recent years, I really focused
on caves for finding new species.

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:50.618
And it turns out, there's lots of new
cavefish species out there.

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:52.425
You just have to know where to look,

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.658
and to maybe be a little thin.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:55.776
(Laughter)

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.825
Now, cavefishes can tell me
a lot about biology and geology.

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:04.197
They can tell me how the landmasses
around them have changed and moved

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.439
by being stuck in these little holes,

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:10.026
and they can tell me about
the evolution of sight, by being blind.

00:01:11.193 --> 00:01:14.470
Now, fish have eyes
that are essentially the same as ours.

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:18.322
All vertebrates do, and each time
a fish species starts to adapt

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:20.758
to this dark, cold, cave environment,

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:24.719
over many, many generations,
they lose their eyes and their eyesight

00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:27.893
until the end up like an eyeless
cavefish like this one here.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.754
Now, each cavefish species
has evolved in a slightly different way,

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:35.850
and each one has a unique geological
and biological story to tell us,

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:38.801
and that's why it's so exciting
when we find a new species.

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:42.654
So this is a new species
we described, from southern Indiana.

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:46.972
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,
the Hoosier cavefish.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:48.057
(Laughter)

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.010
Its closest relatives
are cavefishes in Kentucky,

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.636
in the Mammoth Cave system.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.693
And they start to diverge
when the Ohio River split them

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:57.002
a few million years ago.

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.162
And in that time they developed
these subtle differences

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.947
in the genetic architecture
behind their blindness.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.805
There's this gene called rhodopsin
that's super-critical for sight.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.226
We have it, and these species have it too,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.123
except one species has lost
all function in that gene,

00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:13.821
and the other one maintains it.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:18.257
So this sets up this beautiful
natural experiment

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.245
where we can look at the genes
behind our vision,

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.928
and at the very roots of how we can see.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:26.761
But the genes in these cavefishes

00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:29.571
can also tell us
about deep geological time,

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:32.055
maybe no more so
than in this species here.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.896
This is a new species
we described from Madagascar

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.221
that we named Typhleotris mararybe.

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.510
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:44.083
for how sick we got trying
to collect this species.

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:46.192
Now, believe it or not,

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:48.806
swimming around sinkholes
full of dead things

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.713
and cave full of bat poop

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.546
isn't the smartest thing you could
be doing with your life,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.079
but YOLO.

00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:58.898
(Laughter)

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:03.096
Now, I love this species despite the fact
that it tried to kill us,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.915
and that's because
this species in Madagascar,

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.763
its closest relatives
are 6,000 kilometers away,

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.151
cavefishes in Australia.

00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:14.336
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
freshwater cavefish

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.399
can swim across the Indian Ocean,

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:19.254
so what we found when we compared
the DNA of these species

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:22.575
is that they've been separated
for more than 100 million years,

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.938
or about the time that the southern
continents were last together.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.081
So in fact, these species
didn't move at all.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:31.906
It's the continents that moved them.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.953
And so they give us, through their DNA,

00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:36.398
this precise model and measure

00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:39.580
of how to date and time
these ancient geological events.

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:43.296
Now, this species here is so new

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.803
I'm not even allowed
to tell you its name yet,

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:48.489
but I can tell you
it's a new species from Mexico,

00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:50.264
and it's probably already extinct.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:54.014
It's probably extinct because
the only known cave system it's from

00:03:54.038 --> 00:03:56.690
was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:58.676
Unfortunately for cavefishes,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.280
their groundwater habitat

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.500
is also our main source of drinking water.

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:07.801
Now, we actually don't know
this species' closest relative, yet.

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:10.475
It doesn't appear to be
anything else in Mexico,

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.199
so maybe it's something in Cuba,

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:14.245
or Florida, or India.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.335
But whatever it is, it might tell us
something new about the geology

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.567
of the Caribbean, or the biology
of how to better diagnose

00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:24.712
certain types of blindness.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:28.146
But I hope we discover this species
before it goes extinct too.

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:30.648
And I'm going to spend my one life

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:34.201
as an ichthyologist
trying to discover and save

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:36.803
these humble little blind cavefishes

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:40.293
that can tell us so much
about the geology of the planet

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.133
and the biology of how we see.

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:43.823
Thank you.

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:48.206
(Applause)
