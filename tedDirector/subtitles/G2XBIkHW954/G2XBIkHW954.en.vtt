00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.967
I want you to take a look at this baby.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.235
What you're drawn to are her eyes
and the skin you love to touch.

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.786
But today I'm going to talk to you
about something you can't see.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.562
What's going on
up in that little brain of hers.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:35.316
The modern tools of neuroscience
are demonstrating to us

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.235
that what's going on up there
is nothing short of rocket science.

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:43.433
And what we're learning
is going to shed some light

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:49.355
on what the romantic writers and poets
described as the "celestial openness"

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.236
of the child's mind.

00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:55.731
What we see here is a mother in India,

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:59.659
and she's speaking Koro,
which is a newly discovered language.

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:01.864
And she's talking to her baby.

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:03.505
What this mother --

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.748
and the 800 people who speak
Koro in the world --

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:09.982
understands is that,
to preserve this language,

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.592
they need to speak it to the babies.

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:15.491
And therein lies a critical puzzle.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:17.765
Why is it that you can't
preserve a language

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.024
by speaking to you and I, to the adults?

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:23.236
Well, it's got to do with your brain.

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:28.236
What we see here is that language
has a critical period for learning.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.060
The way to read this slide is to look
at your age on the horizontal axis.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.767
(Laughter)

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.430
And you'll see on the vertical
your skill at acquiring a second language.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.908
The babies and children are geniuses
until they turn seven,

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:45.236
and then there's a systematic decline.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.757
After puberty, we fall off the map.

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.726
No scientists dispute this curve,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.705
but laboratories all over the world

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.236
are trying to figure out
why it works this way.

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:59.812
Work in my lab is focused on the first
critical period in development,

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.681
and that is the period in which babies

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:05.070
try to master which sounds
are used in their language.

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:07.584
We think, by studying
how the sounds are learned,

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:09.873
we'll have a model
for the rest of language,

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.835
and perhaps for critical periods
that may exist in childhood

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.722
for social, emotional
and cognitive development.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:18.236
So we've been studying the babies

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.763
using a technique
that we're using all over the world

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:22.643
and the sounds of all languages.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.458
The baby sits on a parent's lap,

00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:27.403
and we train them to turn
their heads when a sound changes --

00:02:27.427 --> 00:02:28.885
like from "ah" to "ee."

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.342
If they do so at the appropriate time,
the black box lights up

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:34.350
and a panda bear pounds a drum.

00:02:34.374 --> 00:02:36.792
A six-monther adores the task.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.581
What have we learned?

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.765
Well, babies all over the world

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.447
are what I like to describe
as "citizens of the world."

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:47.834
They can discriminate
all the sounds of all languages,

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:51.090
no matter what country we're testing
and what language we're using,

00:02:51.114 --> 00:02:54.109
and that's remarkable
because you and I can't do that.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.104
We're culture-bound listeners.

00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:58.523
We can discriminate the sounds
of our own language,

00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:00.394
but not those of foreign languages.

00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:03.585
So the question arises:
When do those citizens of the world

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.493
turn into the language-bound
listeners that we are?

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:09.654
And the answer:
before their first birthdays.

00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:12.810
What you see here is performance
on that head-turn task

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.297
for babies tested in Tokyo
and the United States,

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:16.759
here in Seattle,

00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:18.532
as they listened to "ra" and "la" --

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:21.362
sounds important to English,
but not to Japanese.

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:24.764
So at six to eight months,
the babies are totally equivalent.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.342
Two months later,
something incredible occurs.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:30.046
The babies in the United States
are getting a lot better,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.994
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:35.468
but both of those groups of babies
are preparing for exactly the language

00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:36.984
that they are going to learn.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:41.632
So the question is: What's happening
during this critical two-month period?

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.999
This is the critical period
for sound development,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.438
but what's going on up there?

00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:47.441
So there are two things going on.

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:50.341
The first is that the babies
are listening intently to us,

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:54.098
and they're taking statistics
as they listen to us talk --

00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:56.103
they're taking statistics.

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:58.666
So listen to two mothers
speaking motherese --

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.732
the universal language
we use when we talk to kids --

00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:03.967
first in English and then in Japanese.

00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.430
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:10.260
so pretty and nice.

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:17.236
(Japanese)

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:21.079
Patricia Kuhl: During the production
of speech, when babies listen,

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:25.872
what they're doing is taking statistics
on the language that they hear.

00:04:26.613 --> 00:04:29.523
And those distributions grow.

00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:33.920
And what we've learned is that babies
are sensitive to the statistics,

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:37.772
and the statistics of Japanese
and English are very, very different.

00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:40.453
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.

00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.236
The distribution shows.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.100
And the distribution of Japanese
is totally different,

00:04:45.124 --> 00:04:48.125
where we see a group
of intermediate sounds,

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:50.564
which is known as the Japanese "R."

00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:54.696
So babies absorb
the statistics of the language

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.398
and it changes their brains;

00:04:56.422 --> 00:04:58.573
it changes them
from the citizens of the world

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:01.543
to the culture-bound
listeners that we are.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:06.280
But we as adults are no longer
absorbing those statistics.

00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:08.861
We are governed
by the representations in memory

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:11.434
that were formed early in development.

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.236
So what we're seeing here

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.493
is changing our models
of what the critical period is about.

00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:19.286
We're arguing from
a mathematical standpoint

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.450
that the learning of language
material may slow down

00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:24.854
when our distributions stabilize.

00:05:24.878 --> 00:05:27.740
It's raising lots of questions
about bilingual people.

00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:32.209
Bilinguals must keep two sets
of statistics in mind at once

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:35.116
and flip between them,
one after the other,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.912
depending on who they're speaking to.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.090
So we asked ourselves,

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:41.521
can the babies take statistics
on a brand new language?

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:44.823
And we tested this
by exposing American babies

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:46.536
who'd never heard a second language

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.276
to Mandarin for the first time
during the critical period.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.837
We knew that, when monolinguals
were tested in Taipei and Seattle

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.523
on the Mandarin sounds,
they showed the same pattern.

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:58.018
Six to eight months,
they're totally equivalent.

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.578
Two months later,
something incredible happens.

00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:04.154
But the Taiwanese babies are getting
better, not the American babies.

00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:09.060
What we did was expose American babies,
during this period, to Mandarin.

00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:12.092
It was like having Mandarin relatives
come and visit for a month

00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:15.913
and move into your house
and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.

00:06:15.937 --> 00:06:18.143
Here's what it looked like
in the laboratory.

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:23.723
(Mandarin)

00:06:39.922 --> 00:06:42.168
PK: So what have we done
to their little brains?

00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:44.236
(Laughter)

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.931
We had to run a control group to make sure

00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:50.167
that coming into the laboratory
didn't improve your Mandarin skills.

00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:52.844
So a group of babies came in
and listened to English.

00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:54.270
And we can see from the graph

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:56.877
that exposure to English
didn't improve their Mandarin.

00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.496
But look at what happened to the babies
exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.920
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan

00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:05.920
who'd been listening
for 10 and a half months.

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:09.768
What it demonstrated is that babies
take statistics on a new language.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:13.236
Whatever you put in front of them,
they'll take statistics on.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.850
But we wondered what role

00:07:14.874 --> 00:07:19.111
the human being played
in this learning exercise.

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:23.744
So we ran another group of babies
in which the kids got the same dosage,

00:07:23.768 --> 00:07:26.236
the same 12 sessions,
but over a television set.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.921
And another group of babies
who had just audio exposure

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:32.033
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.

00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:34.236
What did we do to their brains?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.635
What you see here is the audio result --

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:39.921
no learning whatsoever --

00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:41.703
and the video result --

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:44.341
no learning whatsoever.

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:48.506
It takes a human being
for babies to take their statistics.

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:51.048
The social brain is controlling

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.177
when the babies
are taking their statistics.

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.694
We want to get inside the brain
and see this thing happening

00:07:56.718 --> 00:08:00.656
as babies are in front of televisions,
as opposed to in front of human beings.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.377
Thankfully, we have a new machine,
magnetoencephalography,

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:06.694
that allows us to do this.

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:09.303
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.

00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:13.810
But it's completely safe,
completely noninvasive and silent.

00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:16.277
We're looking at millimeter accuracy

00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:19.617
with regard to spatial
and millisecond accuracy

00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.263
using 306 SQUIDs --

00:08:22.287 --> 00:08:25.387
these are superconducting
quantum interference devices --

00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:29.042
to pick up the magnetic fields
that change as we do our thinking.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:35.118
We're the first in the world
to record babies in an MEG machine

00:08:35.142 --> 00:08:37.533
while they are learning.

00:08:37.557 --> 00:08:39.236
So this is little Emma.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.168
She's a six-monther.

00:08:41.192 --> 00:08:46.310
And she's listening to various languages
in the earphones that are in her ears.

00:08:46.334 --> 00:08:48.558
You can see, she can move around.

00:08:48.582 --> 00:08:52.352
We're tracking her head
with little pellets in a cap,

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:55.351
so she's free to move
completely unconstrained.

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:57.588
It's a technical tour de force.

00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:59.196
What are we seeing?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.114
We're seeing the baby brain.

00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:06.424
As the baby hears a word in her language,
the auditory areas light up,

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:11.236
and then subsequently areas surrounding it
that we think are related to coherence,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.236
getting the brain coordinated
with its different areas, and causality,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.236
one brain area
causing another to activate.

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:24.245
We are embarking on a grand
and golden age of knowledge

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:26.505
about child's brain development.

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:28.950
We're going to be able
to see a child's brain

00:09:28.974 --> 00:09:33.215
as they experience an emotion,
as they learn to speak and read,

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.441
as they solve a math problem,
as they have an idea.

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:40.124
And we're going to be able to invent
brain-based interventions

00:09:40.148 --> 00:09:42.418
for children who have difficulty learning.

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:45.897
Just as the poets and writers described,

00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:50.075
we're going to be able to see, I think,
that wondrous openness,

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:53.523
utter and complete openness,
of the mind of a child.

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:56.960
In investigating the child's brain,

00:09:56.984 --> 00:10:00.980
we're going to uncover deep truths
about what it means to be human,

00:10:01.004 --> 00:10:02.159
and in the process,

00:10:02.183 --> 00:10:05.254
we may be able to help keep
our own minds open to learning

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:06.969
for our entire lives.

00:10:06.993 --> 00:10:08.236
Thank you.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
(Applause)
