00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:15.793
Some people are obsessed
by French wines.

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:18.524
Others love playing golf

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:20.187
or devouring literature.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.304
One of my greatest pleasures
in life is, I have to admit,

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:25.534
a bit special.

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:30.914
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy
watching cities from the sky,

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:32.319
from an airplane window.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:35.911
Some cities are calmly industrious,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.475
like Dusseldorf

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.140
or Louisville.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.413
Others project an energy
that they can hardly contain,

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:44.754
like New York

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.003
or Hong Kong.

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:48.806
And then you have Paris

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:51.204
or Istanbul,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:53.201
and their patina full of history.

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:56.158
I see cities as living beings.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.982
And when I discover them from far above,

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.431
I like to find those main streets
and highways that structure their space.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.495
Especially at night,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.342
when commuters make these arteries
look dramatically red and golden:

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:15.195
the city's vascular system
performing its vital function

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.429
right before your eyes.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.409
But when I'm sitting in my car

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.312
after an hour and a half
of commute every day,

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.213
that reality looks very different.

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:27.291
(Laughter)

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:28.473
Nothing --

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:30.187
not public radio,

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.370
no podcast --

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:32.422
(Laughter)

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:34.455
Not even mindfulness meditation

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.094
makes this time worth living.

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:37.727
(Laughter)

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:39.226
Isn't it absurd

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.707
that we created cars
that can reach 130 miles per hour

00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:49.353
and we now drive them at the same speed
as 19th-century horse carriages?

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:50.636
(Laughter)

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.402
In the US alone,

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:57.820
we spent 29.6 billion hours
commuting in 2014.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:01:59.899
With that amount of time,

00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:04.214
ancient Egyptians could have built
26 Pyramids of Giza.

00:02:04.238 --> 00:02:05.284
(Laughter)

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:06.706
We do that in one year.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.106
A monumental waste of time,
energy and human potential.

00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:13.331
For decades,

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:15.663
our remedy for congestion was simple:

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:18.728
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:20.348
And it worked.

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:22.830
It worked admirably for Paris,

00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:25.944
when the city tore down
hundreds of historical buildings

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:27.615
to create 85 miles

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.920
of transportation-friendly boulevards.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.099
And it still works today
in fast-growing emerging cities.

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.945
But in more established urban centers,

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.899
significant network expansions
are almost impossible:

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:42.843
habitat is just too dense,

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.840
real estate, too expensive

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.924
and public finances, too fragile.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.385
Our city's vascular system
is getting clogged, it's getting sick,

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.016
and we should pay attention.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.743
Our current way
of thinking is not working.

00:02:56.172 --> 00:02:58.093
For our transportation to flow,

00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:00.468
we need a new source of inspiration.

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:04.879
So after 16 years
working in transportation,

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:08.983
my "aha moment" happened
when speaking with a biotech customer.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.650
She was telling me how her treatment

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:14.917
was leveraging specific properties
of our vascular system.

00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:18.050
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:21.150
all the veins and arteries in our body

00:03:21.174 --> 00:03:24.381
making miracles of logistics every day."

00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:27.270
This is the moment I realized

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:30.277
that biology has been
in the transportation business

00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:31.812
for billions of years.

00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:34.728
It has been testing countless solutions

00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:38.051
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.

00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:42.893
It really is the world's most
sophisticated transportation laboratory.

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:48.829
So, what if the solution to our traffic
challenges was inside us?

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.160
I wanted to know:

00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:54.980
Why is it that blood flows
in our veins most of our lives,

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.596
when our big cities get clogged
on a daily basis?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.554
And the reality is that you're looking
at two very different networks.

00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:05.832
I don't know if you realize,

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:10.920
but each of us has 60,000 miles
of blood vessels in our bodies --

00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:12.238
60,000 miles.

00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:14.854
That's two-and-a-half times
the Earth's circumference,

00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:16.131
inside you.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.179
What it means is that blood vessels
are everywhere inside us,

00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:22.230
not just under the surface of our skin.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.819
But if you look at our cities,

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:27.941
yes, we have some
underground subway systems

00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:30.381
and some tunnels and bridges,

00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:32.685
and also some helicopters in the sky.

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:36.768
But the vast majority of our traffic
is focused on the ground,

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:37.969
on the surface.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.805
So in other words,

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:44.208
while our vascular system uses
the three dimensions inside us,

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.996
our urban transportation
is mostly two-dimensional.

00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:50.914
And so what we need
is to embrace that verticality.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.855
If our surface grid is saturated,

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.777
well, let's elevate our traffic.

00:04:56.174 --> 00:05:00.058
This Chinese concept of a bus
that can straddle traffic jams --

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:05.079
that was an eye-opener on new ways
to think about space and movement

00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:06.389
inside our cities.

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:08.675
And we can go higher,

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.991
and suspend our transportation
like we did with our electrical grid.

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:16.985
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi
are talking about testing

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.841
these futuristic networks
of suspended magnetic pods.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.361
And we can keep climbing, and fly.

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:27.190
The fact that a company like Airbus

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:30.522
is now seriously working
on flying urban taxis

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:31.919
is telling us something.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:37.501
Flying cars are finally moving
from science-fiction déjà vu

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.214
to attractive business-case territory.

00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:41.848
And that's an exciting moment.

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:45.044
So building this 3-D
transportation network

00:05:45.068 --> 00:05:50.386
is one of the ways we can mitigate
and solve traffic jams.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.820
But it's not the only one.

00:05:52.257 --> 00:05:53.875
We have to question

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.666
other fundamental choices
that we made, like the vehicles we use.

00:05:58.278 --> 00:06:00.618
Just imagine a very familiar scene:

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:03.116
You've been driving for 42 minutes.

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:06.379
The two kids behind you
are getting restless.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.104
And you're late.

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:11.019
Do you see that slow car in front of you?

00:06:11.474 --> 00:06:13.292
Always comes when you're late, right?

00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:14.451
(Laughter)

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:16.638
That driver is looking for parking.

00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.410
There is no parking spot
available in the area,

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:20.777
but how would he know?

00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:26.468
It is estimated that up to 30 percent
of urban traffic is generated

00:06:26.492 --> 00:06:28.217
by drivers looking for parking.

00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:30.965
Do you see the 100 cars around you?

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:34.160
Eighty-five of them
only have one passenger.

00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:38.791
Those 85 drivers could all fit
in one Londonian red bus.

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:40.490
So the question is:

00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:43.574
Why are we wasting so much space
if it is what we need the most?

00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:45.360
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.700
Biology would never do this.

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.236
Space inside our arteries
is fully utilized.

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:53.246
At every heartbeat,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.283
a higher blood pressure literally compacts
millions of red blood cells

00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:59.425
into massive trains of oxygen

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:01.338
that quickly flow throughout our body.

00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:05.701
And the tiny space inside our red
blood cells is not wasted, either.

00:07:06.357 --> 00:07:08.074
In healthy conditions,

00:07:08.098 --> 00:07:12.136
more than 95 percent
of their oxygen capacity is utilized.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:15.355
Can you imagine if the vehicles
we used in our cities

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.063
were 95 percent full,

00:07:17.087 --> 00:07:20.471
all the additional space
you would have to walk, to bike

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:22.033
and to enjoy our cities?

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:26.129
The reason blood is so
incredibly efficient

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:29.254
is that our red blood cells
are not dedicated

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:31.132
to specific organs or tissues;

00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:34.608
otherwise, we would probably have
traffic jams in our veins.

00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:35.864
No, they're shared.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:38.264
They're shared by all
the cells of our body.

00:07:38.737 --> 00:07:41.390
And because our network is so extensive,

00:07:41.414 --> 00:07:46.174
each one of our 37 trillion cells
gets its own deliveries of oxygen

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:47.727
precisely when it needs them.

00:07:48.253 --> 00:07:52.843
Blood is both a collective
and individual form of transportation.

00:07:53.513 --> 00:07:55.057
But for our cities,

00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:56.365
we've been stuck.

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:58.434
We've been stuck in an endless debate

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:03.675
between creating a car-centric society
or extensive mass-transit systems.

00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:05.910
I think we should transcend this.

00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:10.253
I think we can create vehicles
that combine the convenience of cars

00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:12.594
and the efficiencies of trains and buses.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.864
Just imagine.

00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:19.136
You're comfortably sitting
in a fast and smooth urban train,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.271
along with 1,200 passengers.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.637
The problem with urban trains

00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:28.056
is that sometimes you have to stop
five, ten, fifteen times

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.621
before your final destination.

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:33.332
What if in this train
you didn't have to stop?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.198
In this train,

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:38.451
wagons can detach dynamically
while you're moving

00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:41.494
and become express, driverless buses

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:43.571
that move on a secondary road network.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.925
And so without a single stop,

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:47.536
nor a lengthy transfer,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.969
you are now sitting in a bus
that is headed toward your suburb.

00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:53.573
And when you get close,

00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:56.904
the section you're sitting in detaches

00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:59.878
and self-drives you
right to your doorstep.

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:03.184
It is collective and individual
at the same time.

00:09:03.922 --> 00:09:08.799
This could be one of the shared,
modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.

00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:10.842
Now ...

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.375
as if walking in a city
buzzing with drones,

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:18.686
flying taxis, modular buses
and suspended magnetic pods

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.161
was not exotic enough,

00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:22.999
I think there is another force in action

00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:25.604
that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.

00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:28.130
If you think about it,

00:09:28.154 --> 00:09:33.160
the current generation of driverless cars
is just trying to earn its way

00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:36.214
into a traffic grid
made by and for humans.

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:40.039
They're trying to learn traffic rules,
which is relatively simple,

00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:42.460
and coping with human unpredictability,

00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:44.096
which is more challenging.

00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:48.490
But what would happen
when whole cities become driverless?

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:50.827
Would we need traffic lights?

00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.447
Would we need lanes?

00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:53.970
How about speed limits?

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:56.852
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.

00:09:57.402 --> 00:09:59.363
They never stop at red lights.

00:09:59.387 --> 00:10:01.363
In the first driverless cities,

00:10:01.387 --> 00:10:03.504
you would have no red lights and no lanes.

00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:07.087
And when all the cars
are driverless and connected,

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.195
everything is predictable
and reaction time, minimum.

00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:13.133
They can drive much faster

00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:16.094
and can take any rational initiative
that can speed them up

00:10:16.118 --> 00:10:17.475
or the cars around them.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.275
So instead of rigid traffic rules,

00:10:22.203 --> 00:10:23.535
flow will be regulated

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:28.386
by a mesh of dynamic and constantly
self-improving algorithms.

00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:33.195
The result: a strange traffic

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:36.730
that mixes the fast and smooth
rigor of German autobahns

00:10:36.754 --> 00:10:40.054
and the creative vitality
of the intersections of Mumbai.

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:42.254
(Laughter)

00:10:42.278 --> 00:10:44.233
Traffic will be functionally exuberant.

00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:46.698
It will be liquid like our blood.

00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:48.478
And by a strange paradox,

00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:51.313
the more robotized
our traffic grid will be,

00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:54.093
the more organic and alive
its movement will feel.

00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:56.852
So yes,

00:10:56.876 --> 00:11:00.574
biology has all the attributes
of a transportation genius today.

00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:03.407
But this process has taken
billions of years,

00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:06.433
and went through all sorts
of iterations and mutations.

00:11:06.892 --> 00:11:10.320
We can't wait billions of years
to evolve our transportation system.

00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:12.807
We now have the dreams,

00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:14.123
the concepts

00:11:14.147 --> 00:11:16.453
and the technology

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:19.327
to create 3-D transportation networks,

00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:21.066
invent new vehicles

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.714
and change the flow in our cities.

00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:24.264
Let's do it.

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:25.452
Thank you.

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.309
(Applause)
