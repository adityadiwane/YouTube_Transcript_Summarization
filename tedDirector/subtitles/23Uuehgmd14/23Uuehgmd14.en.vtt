00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:19.359
So I'm here to tell you
that we have a problem with boys,

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.251
and it's a serious problem with boys.

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.645
Their culture isn't working in schools,

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.447
and I'm going to share with you ways

00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:29.236
that we can think
about overcoming that problem.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:32.531
First, I want to start
by saying, this is a boy,

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:35.077
and this is a girl,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.649
and this is probably stereotypically
what you think of as a boy and a girl.

00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:42.456
If I essentialize gender for you today,
then you can dismiss what I have to say.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.444
So I'm not going to do that,
I'm not interested in doing that.

00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:48.685
This is a different kind of boy
and a different kind of girl.

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:53.142
So the point here is that not all boys
exist within these rigid boundaries

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.356
of what we think of as boys and girls,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.935
and not all girls exist
within those rigid boundaries

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:59.351
of what we think of as girls.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.100
But, in fact, most boys
tend to be a certain way,

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:05.101
and most girls tend to be a certain way.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:07.364
And the point is that, for boys,

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.574
the way that they exist
and the culture that they embrace

00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:13.106
isn't working well in schools now.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.354
How do we know that?

00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:19.137
The 100 girls project
tells us some really nice statistics.

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.674
For example, for every 100 girls
that are suspended from school,

00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:25.618
there are 250 boys
that are suspended from school.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:27.965
For every 100 girls
who are expelled from school,

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.789
there are 335 boys
who are expelled from school.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.687
For every 100 girls in special education,

00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:35.393
there are 217 boys.

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:38.103
For every 100 girls
with a learning disability,

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:39.850
there are 276 boys.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:45.007
For every 100 girls
with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:46.801
we have 324 boys.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.401
And by the way, all of these numbers
are significantly higher

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:51.845
if you happen to be black,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.712
if you happen to be poor,

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:56.260
if you happen to exist
in an overcrowded school.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630
And if you are a boy,

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:03.390
you're four times as likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD --

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.875
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:09.400
Now there is another side to this.

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:15.034
And it is important that we recognize
that women still need help in school,

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:17.321
that salaries are still
significantly lower,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.643
even when controlled for job types,

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:23.402
and that girls have continued to struggle
in math and science for years.

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:25.130
That's all true.

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:27.433
Nothing about that prevents us

00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:29.491
from paying attention
to the literacy needs

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.586
of our boys between ages three and 13.

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.261
And so we should.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:36.308
In fact, what we ought to do
is take a page from their playbook,

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:40.579
because the initiatives and programs
that have been set in place

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.444
for women in science and engineering
and mathematics are fantastic.

00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:48.398
They've done a lot of good
for girls in these situations,

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:52.236
and we ought to be thinking about
how we can make that happen for boys too

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.537
in their younger years.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.236
Even in their older years,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.747
what we find is that
there's still a problem.

00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:00.356
When we look at the universities,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.378
60 percent of baccalaureate degrees
are going to women now,

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:05.236
which is a significant shift.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.131
And in fact, university administrators
are a little uncomfortable about the idea

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:14.060
that we may be getting close to 70 percent
female population in universities.

00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:16.434
This makes university
administrators very nervous,

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.648
because girls don't want to go
to schools that don't have boys.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.888
And so we're starting to see

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.069
the establishment of men centers
and men studies

00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:31.370
to think about how do we engage men
in their experiences in the university.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.171
If you talk to faculty,
they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:35.743
they're playing video games,

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:38.736
and they're gambling
online all night long,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.575
and they're playing World of Warcraft,

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.431
and that's affecting
their academic achievement."

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.901
Guess what?

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:49.396
Video games are not the cause.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.235
Video games are a symptom.

00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:56.141
They were turned off a long time
before they got here.

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:59.046
So let's talk about
why they got turned off

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.919
when they were between the ages
of three and 13.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.329
There are three reasons that I believe

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:07.615
that boys are out of sync
with the culture of schools today.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.236
The first is zero tolerance.

00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:15.644
A kindergarten teacher I know,
her son donated all of his toys to her,

00:04:15.668 --> 00:04:21.514
and when he did, she had to go through
and pull out all the little plastic guns.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.754
You can't have plastic knives
and swords and axes

00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:27.921
and all that kind of thing
in a kindergarten classroom.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:31.820
What is it that we're afraid that this
young man is going to do with this gun?

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.236
I mean, really.

00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:36.236
But here he stands as testament

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.536
to the fact that you can't roughhouse
on the playground today.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.569
Now I'm not advocating for bullies.

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:46.796
I'm not suggesting that we need to be
allowing guns and knives in the school.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.076
But when we say that an Eagle Scout
in a high school classroom

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.425
who has a locked parked car
in the parking lot and a penknife in it,

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.472
has to be suspended from school,

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:59.796
I think we may have gone
a little too far with zero tolerance.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.148
Another way that zero tolerance
lives itself out

00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:03.463
is in the writing of boys.

00:05:03.487 --> 00:05:04.872
In a lot of classrooms today,

00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:07.616
you're not allowed to write
about anything that's violent.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.166
You're not allowed to write about anything
that has to do with video games.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.360
These topics are banned.

00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:14.332
Boy comes home from school, and he says,

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.806
"I hate writing."

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.557
"Why do you hate writing, son?
What's wrong with writing?"

00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:20.894
"Now I have to write
what she tells me to write."

00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.919
"OK, what is she telling you to write?"

00:05:23.363 --> 00:05:25.724
"Poems. I have to write poems.

00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:27.744
And little moments in my life.

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:29.744
I don't want to write that stuff."

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.782
"Well, what do you want to write?

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.397
What do you want to write about?"

00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:36.710
"I want to write about video games.
I want to write about leveling-up.

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:39.172
I want to write about
this really interesting world.

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:42.025
I want to write about a tornado
that comes into our house

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:43.561
and blows all the windows out,

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:45.891
and ruins all the furniture
and kills everybody."

00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:47.386
"All right. OK."

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.133
You tell a teacher that,
and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:53.833
"Should we send this child
to the psychologist?"

00:05:54.877 --> 00:05:57.236
And the answer is no, he's just a boy.

00:05:57.772 --> 00:05:59.563
He's just a little boy.

00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:04.235
It's not OK to write these kinds of things
in classrooms today.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.389
So that's the first reason:

00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:08.962
Zero tolerance policies
and the way they're lived out.

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:12.467
The next reason that boys' cultures
are out of sync with school cultures:

00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:13.928
there are fewer male teachers.

00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:16.711
Anybody who's over 15
doesn't know what this means,

00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:18.491
because in the last 10 years,

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:22.308
the number of elementary school
classroom teachers has been cut in half.

00:06:22.332 --> 00:06:25.724
We went from 14 percent to seven percent.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.523
That means that 93 percent of the teachers

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:31.666
that our young men get in elementary
classrooms are women.

00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:34.644
Now what's the problem with this?

00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:36.894
Women are great, yep, absolutely.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.042
But male role models for boys
that say it's all right to be smart --

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:45.668
they've got dads, they've got pastors,
they've got Cub Scout leaders,

00:06:45.692 --> 00:06:48.776
but ultimately, six hours a day,
five days a week

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.046
they're spending in a classroom,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.434
and most of those classrooms
are not places where men exist.

00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:58.006
And so they say, I guess this really
isn't a place for boys.

00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:00.051
This is a place for girls.

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:01.665
And I'm not very good at this,

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.897
so I guess I'd better go play video games

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:06.932
or get into sports,
or something like that,

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.838
because I obviously don't belong here.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:10.972
Men don't belong here,
that's pretty obvious.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:14.884
So that may be a very direct way
that we see it happen.

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:19.235
But less directly, the lack of male
presence in the culture --

00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:22.947
you've got a teachers' lounge,
and they're having a conversation

00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:27.098
about Joey and Johnny
who beat each other up on the playground.

00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:29.126
"What are we going to do with these boys?"

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.834
The answer to that question changes

00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:32.959
depending on who's sitting
around that table.

00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:34.543
Are there men around that table?

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.017
Are there moms who've raised boys
around that table?

00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.783
You'll see, the conversation changes

00:07:38.807 --> 00:07:40.955
depending upon who's sitting
around the table.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:43.831
Third reason that boys
are out of sync with school today:

00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:46.299
Kindergarten is the old
second grade, folks.

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:50.235
We have a serious compression
of the curriculum happening out there.

00:07:50.592 --> 00:07:53.685
When you're three, you better be able
to write your name legibly,

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:56.286
or else we'll consider it
a developmental delay.

00:07:56.754 --> 00:07:58.397
By the time you're in first grade,

00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:01.026
you should be able to read
paragraphs of text

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.530
with maybe a picture, maybe not,
in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.

00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:05.734
If you don't,

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:09.433
we're probably going to be putting you
into a Title I special reading program.

00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:11.755
And if you ask Title I teachers,
they'll tell you

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:15.398
they've got about four or five boys
for every girl that's in their program,

00:08:15.422 --> 00:08:16.626
in the elementary grades.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.404
The reason that this is a problem

00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:21.481
is because the message
that boys are getting

00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:25.847
is, "You need to do what the teacher
asks you to do all the time."

00:08:26.352 --> 00:08:30.512
The teacher's salary depends
on "No Child Left Behind"

00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:33.236
and "Race to the Top"
and accountability and testing

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.236
and all of this.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.234
So she has to figure out a way
to get all these boys

00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:42.235
through this curriculum -- and girls.

00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:46.721
This compressed curriculum is bad
for all active kids.

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:49.566
And what happens is,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.250
she says, "Please, sit down,
be quiet, do what you're told,

00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:59.226
follow the rules, manage your time,
focus, be a girl."

00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:02.127
That's what she tells them.

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:04.236
Indirectly, that's what she tells them.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.320
And so this is a very serious problem.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:08.701
Where is it coming from?
It's coming from us.

00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:11.236
(Laughter)

00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:14.960
We want our babies to read
when they are six months old.

00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:16.236
Have you seen the ads?

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.940
We want to live in Lake Wobegon
where every child is above average ...

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:25.102
but what this does to our children
is really not healthy.

00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:26.936
It's not developmentally appropriate,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.936
and it's particularly bad for boys.

00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:30.679
So what do we do?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.885
We need to meet them where they are.

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:35.173
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:40.452
We need to change the mindset
of acceptance in boys

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:41.914
in elementary schools.

00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:45.624
More specifically, we can do
some very specific things.

00:09:45.648 --> 00:09:47.236
We can design better games.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.075
Most of the educational games
that are out there today

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:51.624
are really flashcards.

00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:53.590
They're glorified drill and practice.

00:09:53.614 --> 00:09:56.427
They don't have the depth,
the rich narrative

00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:59.203
that really engaging video games have,

00:09:59.227 --> 00:10:01.230
that the boys are really interested in.

00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:02.896
So we need to design better games.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.746
We need to talk to teachers and parents
and school board members and politicians.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.346
We need to make sure that people see
that we need more men in the classroom.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.064
We need to look carefully
at our zero tolerance policies.

00:10:13.088 --> 00:10:14.256
Do they make sense?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.236
We need to think about how to uncompress
this curriculum if we can,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.725
trying to bring boys back into a space
that is comfortable for them.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.546
All of those conversations
need to be happening.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.373
There are some great examples
out there of schools --

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:30.880
the New York Times
just talked about a school recently.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:33.236
A game designer from the New School

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.236
put together a wonderful
video gaming school.

00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:41.489
But it only treats a few kids,
and so this isn't very scalable.

00:10:41.513 --> 00:10:43.669
We have to change the culture
and the feelings

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:48.515
that politicians and school board
members and parents have

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:51.606
about the way we accept
and what we accept in our schools today.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.639
We need to find more money
for game design.

00:10:53.663 --> 00:10:56.017
Because good games,
really good games, cost money,

00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.028
and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.

00:10:58.052 --> 00:11:00.144
Most of the educational games do not.

00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:01.416
Where we started:

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.236
my colleagues Mike Petner,
Shawn Vashaw, myself,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.851
we started by trying to look
at the teachers' attitudes

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.220
and find out how do they really
feel about gaming,

00:11:09.244 --> 00:11:10.504
what do they say about it.

00:11:10.528 --> 00:11:15.502
And we discovered that they talk
about the kids in their school,

00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:18.235
who talk about gaming,
in pretty demeaning ways.

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:21.985
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always
talking about that stuff.

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:24.333
They're talking
about their little action figures

00:11:24.357 --> 00:11:26.745
and their little achievements
or merit badges,

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.827
or whatever it is that they get.

00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:30.953
And they're always talking
about this stuff."

00:11:30.977 --> 00:11:32.934
And they say these things as if it's OK.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.236
But if it were your culture,
think of how that might feel.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.641
It's very uncomfortable
to be on the receiving end

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.847
of that kind of language.

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:44.452
They're nervous about anything
that has anything to do with violence

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.361
because of the zero tolerance policies.

00:11:46.385 --> 00:11:48.496
They are sure that parents
and administrators

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.818
will never accept anything.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.726
So we really need to think
about looking at teacher attitudes

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.512
and finding ways to change the attitudes,

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:59.506
so that teachers are much more open
and accepting of boy cultures

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.720
in their classrooms.

00:12:00.744 --> 00:12:02.812
Because, ultimately, if we don't,

00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:06.108
then we're going to have boys
who leave elementary school saying,

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:09.160
"Well I guess that was just
a place for girls, it wasn't for me.

00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:11.959
So I've got to do gaming,
or I've got to do sports."

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:15.429
If we change these things,
if we pay attention to these things,

00:12:15.453 --> 00:12:17.372
and we reengage boys in their learning,

00:12:17.396 --> 00:12:20.570
they will leave the elementary
schools saying, "I'm smart."

00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:22.545
Thank you.

00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:25.045
(Applause)
