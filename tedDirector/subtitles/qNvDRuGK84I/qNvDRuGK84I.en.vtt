00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.266
What do you do if you had
to figure out the information

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.691
behind 11.5 million documents,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.611
verify it and make sense of it?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.302
That was a challenge

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:24.183
that a group of journalists
had to face late last year.

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:28.098
An anonymous person
calling himself John Doe

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:31.174
had somehow managed to copy
nearly 40 years of records

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.698
of the Panamanian law firm
Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:38.007
This is one of many firms around the world

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:41.562
that specialize in setting up accounts
in offshore tax havens

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:43.586
like the British Virgin Islands,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.282
for rich and powerful people
who like to keep secrets.

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.733
John Doe had managed to copy
every spreadsheet from this firm,

00:00:51.757 --> 00:00:53.351
every client file,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.074
every email,

00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:57.877
from 1977 to the present day.

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:01.227
It represented the biggest cache

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.037
of inside information
into the tax haven system

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.589
that anyone had ever seen.

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:10.940
But it also presented a gigantic challenge
to investigative journalism.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.802
Think about it:
11.5 million documents,

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.425
containing the secrets of people
from more than 200 different countries.

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:22.926
Where do you start
with such a vast resource?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.029
Where do you even begin to tell a story

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:27.644
that can trail off
into every corner of the globe,

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:31.412
and that can affect almost
any person in any language,

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.863
sometimes in ways
they don't even know yet.

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:37.015
John Doe had given the information
to two journalists

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.654
at the German newspaper
Süddeutsche Zeitung.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:43.796
He said he was motivated
by -- and I quote --

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.400
"The scale of the injustice
that the documents would reveal."

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:50.384
But one user alone can never make sense

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:52.338
of such a vast amount of information.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.224
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:56.992
to my organization in Washington, DC,

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.387
The International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists.

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:04.500
We decided to do something
that was the very opposite

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.265
of everything we'd been taught
to do as journalists:

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.444
share.

00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:09.849
(Laughter)

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.978
By nature, investigative
reporters are lone wolves.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.831
We fiercely guard our secrets,

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.389
at times even from our editors,

00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:20.273
because we know that the moment
we tell them what we have,

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:22.177
they'll want that story right away.

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:23.989
And to be frank,

00:02:24.607 --> 00:02:26.029
when you get a good story,

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:28.457
you like to keep the glory to yourself.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.342
But there's no doubt
that we live in a shrinking world,

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:35.535
and that the media has largely
been slow to wake up to this.

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.595
The issues we report on
are more and more transnational.

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.863
Giant corporations operate
on a global level.

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.734
Environmental and health
crises are global.

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:48.727
So, too, are financial flows
and financial crises.

00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:52.492
So it seems staggering
that journalism has been so late

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:55.068
to cover stories in a truly global way.

00:02:55.783 --> 00:02:58.787
And it also seems staggering
that journalism has been so slow

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.220
to wake up to the possibilities
that technology brings,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.248
rather than being frightened of it.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.615
The reason journalists
are scared of technology is this:

00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:13.037
the profession's largest institutions
are going through tough times

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.299
because of the changing way
that people are consuming news.

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.450
The advertising business models
that have sustained reporting are broken.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.548
And this has plunged
journalism into crisis,

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:28.667
forcing those institutions
to reexamine how they function.

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:31.911
But where there is crisis,

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:33.458
there is also opportunity.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.467
The first challenge presented

00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.339
by what would eventually become
known as the Panama Papers

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.912
was to make the documents
searchable and readable.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:43.563
There were nearly five million emails,

00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:46.900
two million PDFs that needed
to be scanned and indexed,

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:49.736
and millions more files
and other kinds of documents.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.999
They all needed to be housed
in a safe and secure location

00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:54.180
in the cloud.

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:58.432
We next invited reporters
to have a look at the documents.

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:02.316
In all, reporters from more
than 100 media organizations

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.983
in 76 countries --

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.478
from the BBC in Britain

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.718
to Le Monde newspaper in France

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.130
to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:16.223
"Native eyes on native names,"
we called it, the idea being,

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:19.606
who best to tell you
who was important to Nigeria

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.200
than a Nigerian journalist?

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:23.748
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?

00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:27.303
There were only two rules
for everyone who was invited:

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:31.509
we all agreed to share everything
that we found with everybody else,

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:34.969
and we all agreed to publish
together on the same day.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.804
We chose our media partners based on trust

00:04:37.828 --> 00:04:41.046
that had been built up through
previous smaller collaborations

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.077
and also from leads
that jumped out from the documents.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:45.860
Over the next few months,

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.542
my small nonprofit organization
of less than 20 people

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:52.999
was joined by more than 350 other
reporters from 25 language groups.

00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:55.957
The biggest information leak in history

00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:59.377
had now spawned the biggest
journalism collaboration in history:

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:06.179
376 sets of native eyes doing
what journalists normally never do,

00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:07.814
working shoulder to shoulder,

00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.464
sharing information,

00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:10.905
but telling no one.

00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:13.701
For it became clear at this point

00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:16.082
that in order to make
the biggest kind of noise,

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:19.291
we first needed
the biggest kind of silence.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.220
To manage the project
over the many months it would take,

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:25.061
we built a secure virtual newsroom.

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.560
We used encrypted communication systems,

00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:30.847
and we built a specially
designed search engine.

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:32.498
Inside the virtual newsroom,

00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:34.609
the reporters could gather
around the themes

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.614
that were emerging from the documents.

00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:41.944
Those interested in blood diamonds
or exotic art, for instance,

00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:45.158
could share information about how
the offshore world was being used

00:05:45.182 --> 00:05:47.389
to hide the trade in both
of those commodities.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.853
Those interested in sport
could share information

00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:53.142
about how famous sports stars
were putting their image rights

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.690
into offshore companies,

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:56.977
thereby likely avoiding taxes

00:05:57.001 --> 00:05:59.477
in the countries
where they plied their trade.

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:01.885
But perhaps most exciting of all

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.386
were the number of world leaders
and elect politicians

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.438
that were emerging from the documents --

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.549
figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:16.350
close associates
of Vladimir Putin in Russia

00:06:17.852 --> 00:06:21.009
and the British Prime Minister,
David Cameron, who is linked

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.350
through his late father, Ian Cameron.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.760
Buried in the documents
were secret offshore entities,

00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:29.572
such as Wintris Inc.,

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:32.303
a company in the British Virgin Islands

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:35.969
that had actually belonged
to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:38.846
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.787
the Icelandic reporter
we invited to join the project,

00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.683
as the loneliest man in the world.

00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:46.520
For nine months, he refused paid work

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:48.627
and lived off the earnings of his wife.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.391
He pasted tarps
over the windows of his home

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:54.945
to prevent prying eyes
during the long Icelandic winter.

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:59.303
And he soon ran out of excuses
to explain his many absences,

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:00.893
as he worked red-eyed,

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:02.123
night after night,

00:07:02.147 --> 00:07:03.384
month after month.

00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:06.320
In all that time, he sat on information

00:07:06.344 --> 00:07:09.587
that would eventually bring down
the leader of his country.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.789
Now, when you're an investigative reporter
and you make an amazing discovery,

00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:17.694
such as your prime minster can be linked
to a secret offshore company,

00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:21.844
that that company has a financial
interest in Icelandic banks --

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:24.218
the very issue he's been elected on --

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:26.892
well, your instinct
is to scream out very loud.

00:07:28.044 --> 00:07:30.938
Instead, as one of the few people
that he could speak to,

00:07:30.962 --> 00:07:33.913
Johannes and I shared
a kind of gallows humor.

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:36.112
"Wintris is coming," he used to say.

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:37.665
(Laughter)

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:39.686
(Applause)

00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:43.564
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.895
When reporters like Johannes
wanted to scream,

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.594
they did so inside the virtual newsroom,

00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:52.837
and then they turned
those screams into stories

00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:55.979
by going outside the documents
to court records,

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.139
official company registers,

00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:02.208
and by eventually putting questions
to those that we intended to name.

00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:07.210
Panama Papers actually allowed
the reporters to look at the world

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:09.850
through a different lens
from everybody else.

00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:11.794
As we were researching the story,

00:08:11.818 --> 00:08:13.236
unconnected to us,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.391
a major political bribery scandal
happened in Brazil.

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:19.954
A new leader was elected in Argentina.

00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:24.499
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:28.326
the organization that controls
the world of professional soccer.

00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:31.366
The Panama Papers
actually had unique insights

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.636
into each one of these unfolding events.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.100
So you can imagine the pressure
and the ego dramas

00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:39.613
that could have ruined
what we were trying to do.

00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:41.175
Any of one of these journalists,

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:42.920
they could have broken the pact.

00:08:42.944 --> 00:08:44.094
But they didn't.

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:46.032
And on April 3 this year,

00:08:46.056 --> 00:08:48.237
at exactly 8pm German time,

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.738
we published simultaneously
in 76 countries.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.203
(Applause)

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.252
The Panama Papers quickly became
one of the biggest stories of the year.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:10.480
This is the scene in Iceland
the day after we published.

00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:12.648
It was the first of many protests.

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:15.407
The Icelandic prime minister
had to resign.

00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:17.779
It was a first of many resignations.

00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:21.838
We spotlighted many famous people
such as Lionel Messi,

00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:24.190
the most famous
soccer player in the world.

00:09:24.726 --> 00:09:27.016
And there were some
unintended consequences.

00:09:27.454 --> 00:09:31.131
These alleged members
of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested

00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:34.006
after we published details
about their hideout.

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.555
They'd been using the address

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:38.549
to register their offshore company.

00:09:38.573 --> 00:09:41.368
(Laughter)

00:09:43.091 --> 00:09:45.652
There's a kind of irony
in what we've been able to do.

00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:49.382
The technology -- the Internet --
that has broken the business model

00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:51.960
is allowing us to reinvent
journalism itself.

00:09:52.516 --> 00:09:54.204
And this dynamic is producing

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:57.068
unprecedented levels
of transparency and impact.

00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:01.258
We showed how a group of journalists
can effect change across the world

00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:05.262
by applying new methods
and old-fashioned journalism techniques

00:10:05.286 --> 00:10:07.690
to vast amounts of leaked information.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:12.571
We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.

00:10:13.205 --> 00:10:14.790
And by sharing resources,

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.503
we were able to dig deep --

00:10:16.527 --> 00:10:20.902
much deeper and longer than most
media organizations allow these days,

00:10:20.926 --> 00:10:22.669
because of financial concerns.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.083
Now, it was a big risk,

00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:27.095
and it wouldn't work for every story,

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.123
but we showed with the Panama Papers

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:32.085
that you can write about any country
from just about anywhere,

00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:35.623
and then choose your preferred
battleground to defend your work.

00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:37.770
Try obtaining a court injunction

00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:41.714
that would prevent the telling
of a story in 76 different countries.

00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:44.064
Try stopping the inevitable.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:49.083
Shortly after we published,
I got a three-word text from Johannes:

00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:52.022
"Wintris has arrived."

00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:53.444
(Laughter)

00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:57.200
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps
has a new era for journalism.

00:10:57.673 --> 00:10:58.829
Thank you.

00:10:58.853 --> 00:11:05.807
(Applause)

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:11.272
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.371
I guess you're going to send
that applause to the 350 journalists

00:11:14.395 --> 00:11:15.973
who worked with you, right?

00:11:15.997 --> 00:11:18.208
Now, a couple of questions
I would like to ask.

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:19.399
The first one is,

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:22.091
you'd been working
in secrecy for over a year

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:25.741
with 350-something colleagues
from all over the world --

00:11:25.765 --> 00:11:29.096
was there ever a moment when you thought

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.248
that the leak may be leaked,

00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:33.975
that the collaboration may just be broken

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:35.578
by somebody publishing a story?

00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:38.420
Or somebody not in the group
releasing some information

00:11:38.444 --> 00:11:39.765
that they got to know?

00:11:40.228 --> 00:11:42.880
Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,

00:11:42.904 --> 00:11:45.635
including when something major
was happening in the world,

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:48.682
the journalists from that country
wanted to publish right away.

00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:49.915
We had to calm them down.

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:53.083
Probably the biggest crisis we had
was a week before publication.

00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:57.118
We'd sent a series of questions
to the associates of Vladimir Putin,

00:11:57.142 --> 00:11:58.635
but instead of responding,

00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:01.622
the Kremlin actually held
a press conference and denounced us,

00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:05.063
and denounced the whole thing
as being, I guess, a plot from the West.

00:12:05.087 --> 00:12:08.103
At that point, Putin thought
it was just about him.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.631
And, of course, a lot of editors
around the world

00:12:10.655 --> 00:12:12.356
were very nervous about this.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.443
They thought the story
was going to get out.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.720
You can imagine the amount
of time they'd spent,

00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:18.903
the amount of resources,
money spent on this.

00:12:18.927 --> 00:12:21.964
So I had to basically spend
the last week calming everyone down,

00:12:21.988 --> 00:12:24.870
a bit like a general,
where you're holding your troops back:

00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:26.194
"Calm, remain calm."

00:12:26.218 --> 00:12:28.370
And then eventually,
of course, they all did.

00:12:29.323 --> 00:12:31.791
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:35.784
you released a lot of the documents
as an open database

00:12:35.808 --> 00:12:38.544
for everybody to search
via keyword, essentially.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:40.194
GR: We very much believe

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.620
that the basic information
about the offshore world

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:43.797
should be made public.

00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:46.698
Now, we didn't publish
the underlying documents

00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:48.587
of the journalists we're working with.

00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.193
But the basic information
such as the name of a person,

00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:54.141
what their offshore company was
and the name of that company,

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:55.521
is now all available online.

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:59.505
In fact, the biggest resource
of its kind basically is out there now

00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:02.247
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.

00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:03.429
GR: Thank you.

00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:06.966
(Applause)
