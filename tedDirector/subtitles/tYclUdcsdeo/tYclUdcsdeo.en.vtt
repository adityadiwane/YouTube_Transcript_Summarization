00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.371
Everyone is both a learner

00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:19.883
and a teacher.

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:22.339
This is me being inspired

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.530
by my first tutor,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.475
my mom,

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.098
and this is me teaching

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:29.051
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:30.291
to 200 students

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:31.563
at Stanford University.

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.019
Now the students and I

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.195
enjoyed the class,

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:35.611
but it occurred to me

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.322
that while the subject matter

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.611
of the class is advanced

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.299
and modern,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.618
the teaching technology isn't.

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:43.954
In fact, I use basically

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:46.324
the same technology as

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:48.954
this 14th-century classroom.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:51.754
Note the textbook,

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:54.698
the sage on the stage,

00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:56.597
and the sleeping guy

00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:57.498
in the back. (Laughter)

00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:00.435
Just like today.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.546
So my co-teacher,

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:05.186
Sebastian Thrun, and I thought,

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:06.960
there must be a better way.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.614
We challenged ourselves

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:09.905
to create an online class

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.536
that would be equal or better

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:13.872
in quality to our Stanford class,

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:16.082
but to bring it to anyone

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.712
in the world for free.

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:20.280
We announced the class on July 29th,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.489
and within two weeks, 50,000 people

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:24.896
had signed up for it.

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:28.001
And that grew to 160,000 students

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.065
from 209 countries.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:31.873
We were thrilled to have

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:32.994
that kind of audience,

00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:35.633
and just a bit terrified that we

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.944
hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:39.556
So we got to work.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:41.192
We studied what others had done,

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:43.515
what we could copy and what we could change.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.176
Benjamin Bloom had showed

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:47.985
that one-on-one tutoring works best,

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:50.113
so that's what we tried to emulate,

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:51.553
like with me and my mom,

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:53.058
even though we knew

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:54.976
it would be one-on-thousands.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.177
Here, an overhead video camera

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:59.009
is recording me as I'm talking

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.688
and drawing on a piece of paper.

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.097
A student said, "This class felt

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:04.249
like sitting in a bar

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.728
with a really smart friend

00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:06.932
who's explaining something

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:09.233
you haven't grasped, but are about to."

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.349
And that's exactly what we were aiming for.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.137
Now, from Khan Academy, we saw

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:15.961
that short 10-minute videos

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:17.737
worked much better than trying

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.808
to record an hour-long lecture

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:22.225
and put it on the small-format screen.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.417
We decided to go even shorter

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:26.065
and more interactive.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:28.312
Our typical video is two minutes,

00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:30.064
sometimes shorter, never more

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.753
than six, and then we pause for

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.120
a quiz question, to make it

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.998
feel like one-on-one tutoring.

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:38.400
Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.648
the grammar of English

00:02:39.648 --> 00:02:41.825
to parse sentences, and here,

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.889
there's a pause and the student

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.126
has to reflect, understand what's going on

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:47.766
and check the right boxes

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.183
before they can continue.

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.631
Students learn best when

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:52.879
they're actively practicing.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.175
We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.143
with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize

00:02:58.143 --> 00:02:59.808
the key ideas themselves.

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:01.520
We mostly avoid questions

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.231
like, "Here's a formula, now

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.306
tell me the value of Y

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:05.518
when X is equal to two."

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.335
We preferred open-ended questions.

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:10.513
One student wrote, "Now I'm seeing

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.375
Bayes networks and examples of

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:13.943
game theory everywhere I look."

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.681
And I like that kind of response.

00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:17.487
That's just what we were going for.

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:19.681
We didn't want students to memorize the formulas;

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:20.871
we wanted to change the way

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:21.961
they looked at the world.

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.287
And we succeeded.

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:25.687
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.

00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.606
And it's a little bit ironic

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.519
that we set about to disrupt traditional education,

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.535
and in doing so, we ended up

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:34.119
making our online class

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.446
much more like a traditional college class

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:38.287
than other online classes.

00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:41.502
Most online classes, the videos are always available.

00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:43.319
You can watch them any time you want.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.606
But if you can do it any time,

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:47.111
that means you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.519
and if you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.681
well, you may not ever

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.439
get around to it. (Laughter)

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.631
So we brought back the innovation

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.718
of having due dates. (Laughter)

00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:58.030
You could watch the videos

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.942
any time you wanted during the week,

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:01.097
but at the end of the week,

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:02.814
you had to get the homework done.

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:04.727
This motivated the students to keep going, and it also

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:07.583
meant that everybody was working

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.101
on the same thing at the same time,

00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:10.598
so if you went into a discussion forum,

00:04:10.598 --> 00:04:13.302
you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:16.241
Now, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.007
were self-organized by the students themselves.

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:22.231
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned

00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.227
the concept of "flipping" the classroom.

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:25.522
Students watched the videos

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.110
on their own, and then they

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.820
come together to discuss them.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.977
From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,

00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:34.601
that peers can be the best teachers,

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.033
because they're the ones

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.881
that remember what it's like to not understand.

00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:41.562
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.

00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:43.961
Of course, we couldn't have

00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:45.593
a classroom discussion with

00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:47.139
tens of thousands of students,

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.625
so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.673
And finally, from Teach For America,

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:55.154
I learned that a class is not

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:56.650
primarily about information.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.481
More important is motivation and determination.

00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.321
It was crucial that the students see

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:03.121
that we're working hard for them and

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.530
they're all supporting each other.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.498
Now, the class ran 10 weeks,

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:11.409
and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.972
at least one video each week,

00:05:12.972 --> 00:05:15.665
and over 20,000 finished all the homework,

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.329
putting in 50 to 100 hours.

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:18.882
They got this statement of accomplishment.

00:05:18.882 --> 00:05:21.001
So what have we learned?

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:23.817
Well, we tried some old ideas

00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:25.474
and some new and put them together,

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:27.556
but there are more ideas to try.

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:29.370
Sebastian's teaching another class now.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.738
I'll do one in the fall.

00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:34.498
Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx

00:05:34.498 --> 00:05:36.769
and others have more classes coming.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.257
It's a really exciting time.

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:39.729
But to me, the most exciting

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.705
part of it is the data that we're gathering.

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.401
We're gathering thousands

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.057
of interactions per student per class,

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:49.265
billions of interactions altogether,

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.769
and now we can start analyzing that,

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:53.233
and when we learn from that,

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:54.474
do experimentations,

00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:56.714
that's when the real revolution will come.

00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:59.490
And you'll be able to see the results from

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.753
a new generation of amazing students.

00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:04.006
(Applause)
