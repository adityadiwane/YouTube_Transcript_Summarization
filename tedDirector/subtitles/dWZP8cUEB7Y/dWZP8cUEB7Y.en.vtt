00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.133
I would like to talk to you
about why many ehealth projects fail.

00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:22.878
And I really think
that the most important thing of it

00:00:22.902 --> 00:00:25.236
is that we stopped listening to patients.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.877
And one thing we did at Radboud University

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.912
is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.

00:00:29.936 --> 00:00:31.543
Not in a very scientific way --

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:34.928
she puts up a little cup
of coffee or a cup of tea

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.595
and asks patients, family, relatives,

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:38.782
"What's up?

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:40.313
How could we help you?"

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:42.367
And we think, we like to think,

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:44.220
that this is one of the major problems

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.372
why all -- maybe not all --

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.236
but most of the ehealth projects fail,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.815
since we stopped listening.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.769
This is my weight scale.

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:55.009
It's a very simple thing.
It's got one knob, on/off.

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:57.358
And every morning I hop on it.

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.035
And yes, I've got a challenge,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.235
as you might see.

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.502
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.472
But the thing is that
it's made this simple

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:09.087
that whenever I hop on,

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.698
it sends my data to Google Health as well.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.813
And it's collected
by my general practitioner as well,

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:19.236
so he can see what's my problem in weight,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.937
not on the very moment
that I need cardiologic support

00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:24.152
or something like it,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:26.236
but also looking backward.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.194
But there's another thing.

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:29.697
As some of you might know,

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:32.047
I've got more than 4000
followers on Twitter.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.689
So every morning, I hop on my weight scale

00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:36.977
and before I'm in my car,

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.310
people start talking to me,

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:40.632
"I think you need
a light lunch today, Lucien."

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:41.807
(Laughter)

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.974
But that's the nicest thing
that could happen,

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:45.553
since this is peer pressure.

00:01:45.577 --> 00:01:48.546
Peer pressure used to help patients --

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:51.103
since this could be used for obesity,

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:54.720
it could be used
to stop patients from smoking.

00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:55.983
But on the other hand,

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.540
it also could be used
to get people out of their chairs

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:03.190
and try to work together
in some kind of gaming activity

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.462
to get more control of their health.

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:08.236
As of next week,
it will soon be available,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.574
there will be this little
blood-pressure meter

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:13.236
connected to an iPhone
or something or other.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.588
And people will be able, from their homes,

00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:18.168
to take their blood pressure,

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:19.881
send it to their doctor

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.591
and eventually share it
with others, for instance,

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:24.522
for over a 100 dollars.

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.515
And this is the point
where patients get into position

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.499
and can collect,
not only their own control again,

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:32.444
be captain of their own ship,

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.785
but also can help us in health care

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.787
due to the challenges that we face,

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.649
like health-care cost explosion,

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:41.520
doubled demand and things like that,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:43.726
make techniques that are easy to use

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.094
and start with this
to embrace patients in the team.

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:49.379
And you can do this
with techniques like this,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:50.941
but also by crowdsourcing.

00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:52.975
And one of the things we did,

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.326
that I would like to share with you
introduced by a little video.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.813
(Music)

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.317
(Heart-beat)

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:10.977
We've all got
navigation controls in our car.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.236
We maybe even have it in our cellphone.

00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:16.032
We perfectly know where all the ATMs are,

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.965
just about the city of Maastricht.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.025
The other thing is we know
where all the gas stations are.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.481
And sure, we could find fast food chains.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.306
But where would be the nearest AED
to help this patient?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.203
We asked around, and nobody knew.

00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:33.842
Nobody knew where
the nearest lifesaving AED

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:35.465
was to be obtained right now.

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:38.378
So what we did,
we crowdsourced the Netherlands.

00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:41.082
We set up a website, and asked the crowd,

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.418
"If you see an AED, please submit it,

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:46.236
tell us where it is,
tell us when it's open,"

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.222
since sometimes in office hours
it's closed, of course.

00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:51.422
And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:52.884
already have been submitted.

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:55.805
The next step we took
was to find the applications for it.

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.465
And we built an iPad application.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.930
We made an application
for Layar: Augmented Reality,

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:02.698
to find these AEDs.

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:05.005
And whenever you are
in a city like Maastricht,

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.629
and somebody collapses,
you can use your iPhone,

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:11.199
and within the next weeks
also your Microsoft cellphone,

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:12.638
to find the nearest AED,

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:14.192
which can save lives.

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:15.996
And as of today,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.714
we would like to introduce this,
not only as AED4EU,

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:20.453
which is what the product is called,

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.236
but also AED4US.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.780
And we would like to start this
on a worldwide level.

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:27.747
And ask all of our colleagues
in the rest of the world,

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:29.818
colleague universities, to help us

00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:32.466
to find and work and act like a hub

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.820
to crowdsource all these AEDs
all around the world,

00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:38.809
that whenever you're on holiday
and somebody collapses,

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:42.314
might it be your own relative
or someone just in front of you,

00:05:42.338 --> 00:05:43.911
you can find this.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.650
The other thing we would like to ask

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:47.749
is of companies also all over the world

00:05:47.773 --> 00:05:50.806
that will be able to help us
validate these AEDs.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.648
These might be courier services

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:54.363
or cable guys, for instance,

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.749
just to see whether
the AED that is submitted

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.339
is still in place.

00:05:58.363 --> 00:06:00.236
So please help us on this one

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.212
and try to make not only
health a little bit better,

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:04.404
but take control of it.

00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:05.594
Thank you.

00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:07.704
(Applause)
