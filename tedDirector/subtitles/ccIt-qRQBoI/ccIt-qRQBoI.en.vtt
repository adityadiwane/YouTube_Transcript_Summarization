00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:15.770
(Music) This is the human test,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.290
a test to see if you are a human.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.489
Please raise your hand if something applies to you.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.330
Are we agreed? Yes?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.486
Then let's begin.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.395
Have you ever eaten a booger

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.937
long past your childhood?

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:36.583
(Laughter)

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:40.161
It's okay, it's safe here.

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.510
Have you ever made a small, weird sound

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.150
when you remembered something embarrassing?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.206
Have you ever purposely lowercased

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.310
the first letter of a text

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.320
in order to come across as sad or disappointed?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.454
(Laughter)

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:02.168
Okay.

00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:04.940
Have you ever ended a text with a period

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.650
as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.817
Have you ever laughed or smiled

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:16.489
when someone said something shitty to you

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.250
and then spent the rest of the day

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.354
wondering why you reacted that way?

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:24.532
Yes.

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:27.292
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:29.180
a thousand times as you walked

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.210
from the check-in to the gate?

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.260
Yes.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.837
Have you ever put on a pair of pants

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:38.676
and then much later realized that there was

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.308
a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?

00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:43.280
(Laughter)

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.812
Good.

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:48.708
Have you ever tried to guess
someone else's password

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:52.985
so many times that it locked their account?

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.674
Mmm.

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:57.820
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.240
you will be discovered as a fraud?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.314
Yes, it's safe here.

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:07.910
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.840
you hadn't discovered yet

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.760
that you were just naturally great at?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.360
Mmm.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.264
Have you ever broken something in real life,

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:19.976
and then found yourself looking

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:25.050
for an "undo" button in real life?

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.232
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:28.800
and then immediately started imagining

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.829
what a three-day Vancouver
vacation might look like?

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:37.402
Have you ever marveled

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:40.537
at how someone you thought was so ordinary

00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:44.946
could suddenly become so beautiful?

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:47.010
Have you ever stared at your phone

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.460
smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.820
Have you ever subsequently texted that person

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.612
the phrase "I'm staring at the phone

00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:01.158
smiling like an idiot"?

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.228
Have you ever been tempted to,

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:05.166
and then gave in to the temptation,

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:09.111
of looking through someone else's phone?

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.391
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.375
and then suddenly realized

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:16.568
you're a real asshole to yourself?

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:18.975
(Laughter)

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.879
Has your phone ever run out of battery

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.265
in the middle of an argument,

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:25.863
and it sort of felt like the phone

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:29.915
was breaking up with both of you?

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:31.513
Have you ever thought

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:34.483
that working on an issue between you was futile

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:37.204
because it should just be easier than this,

00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:41.948
or this is supposed to happen just naturally?

00:03:41.948 --> 00:03:45.356
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,

00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:47.812
just happens naturally?

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:51.341
Have you ever woken up blissfully

00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.148
and suddenly been flooded
by the awful remembrance

00:03:54.148 --> 00:03:57.212
that someone had left you?

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:59.949
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.246
without a person

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:04.500
that no longer was in your life?

00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:08.458
Have you ever looked back on that event

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.366
with the sad smile of autumn

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.766
and the realization that futures will happen

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.901
regardless?

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.966
Congratulations.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.341
You have now completed the test.

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.540
You are all human.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.054
(Applause)
