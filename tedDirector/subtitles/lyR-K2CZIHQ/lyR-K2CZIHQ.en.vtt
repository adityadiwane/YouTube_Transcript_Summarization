00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:16.333
On November 5th, 1990,

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.132
a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:21.517
into a hotel in Manhattan

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:24.482
and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:28.280
the leader of the Jewish Defense League.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.940
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.566
but while serving time on lesser charges,

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.160
he and other men began planning attacks

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.051
on a dozen New York City landmarks,

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.395
including tunnels, synagogues

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.281
and the United Nations headquarters.

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.004
Thankfully, those plans were foiled

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.841
by an FBI informant.

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:51.397
Sadly, the 1993 bombing

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:54.578
of the World Trade Center was not.

00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:56.317
Nosair would eventually be convicted

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:59.741
for his involvement in the plot.

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.988
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:05.898
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:09.622
in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:12.817
and a loving American mother
and grade school teacher,

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:14.068
who together tried their best

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:17.181
to create a happy childhood for me.

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.723
It wasn't until I was seven years old

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:22.266
that our family dynamic started to change.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.416
My father exposed me to a side of Islam

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:28.343
that few people, including the majority of Muslims,

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:31.060
get to see.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.729
It's been my experience that when people

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.091
take the time to interact with one another,

00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:38.149
it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.601
we all want the same things out of life.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.778
However, in every religion, in every population,

00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:46.366
you'll find a small percentage of people

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.324
who hold so fervently to their beliefs

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:52.088
that they feel they must use any means necessary

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:55.684
to make others live as they do.

00:01:55.684 --> 00:01:57.545
A few months prior to his arrest,

00:01:57.545 --> 00:01:59.547
he sat me down and explained that

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:02.666
for the past few weekends, he and some friends

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:04.780
had been going to a shooting range on Long Island

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.963
for target practice.

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.653
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.

00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:12.464
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.979
which unbeknownst to our group was being watched

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.100
by the FBI.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.081
When it was my turn to shoot,

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.767
my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.212
and explained how to aim at the target

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:26.353
about 30 yards off.

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:28.696
That day, the last bullet I shot

00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:31.715
hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.844
and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:38.818
the entire target burst into flames.

00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:40.719
My uncle turned to the other men,

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.040
and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.795
Like father, like son.

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:50.402
They all seemed to get a really
big laugh out of that comment,

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.182
but it wasn't until a few years later

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:55.957
that I fully understood what
they thought was so funny.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:58.257
They thought they saw in me the same destruction

00:02:58.257 --> 00:03:01.588
my father was capable of.

00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:03.967
Those men would eventually be convicted

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.940
of placing a van filled with
1,500 pounds of explosives

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.089
into the sub-level parking lot of the
World Trade Center's North Tower,

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.930
causing an explosion that killed six people

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.310
and injured over 1,000 others.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.701
These were the men I looked up to.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.897
These were the men I called
ammu, which means uncle.

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:26.668
By the time I turned 19,

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:29.937
I had already moved 20 times in my life,

00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:31.966
and that instability during my childhood

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:33.440
didn't really provide an opportunity

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.321
to make many friends.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.474
Each time I would begin to feel
comfortable around someone,

00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:41.643
it was time to pack up and move to the next town.

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:43.822
Being the perpetual new face in class,

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:46.461
I was frequently the target of bullies.

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:48.771
I kept my identity a secret from my classmates

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:50.089
to avoid being targeted,

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.485
but as it turns out, being the
quiet, chubby new kid in class

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:56.002
was more than enough ammunition.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.199
So for the most part, I spent my time at home

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.870
reading books and watching TV

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.639
or playing video games.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.509
For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.759
to say the least,

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.194
and growing up in a bigoted household,

00:04:08.194 --> 00:04:10.674
I wasn't prepared for the real world.

00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:12.393
I'd been raised to judge people

00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:14.460
based on arbitrary measurements,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.203
like a person's race or religion.

00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:21.354
So what opened my eyes?

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:22.948
One of my first experiences

00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:25.130
that challenged this way of thinking

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.117
was during the 2000 presidential elections.

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.151
Through a college prep program,

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:31.285
I was able to take part

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:34.655
in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.586
My particular group's focus was on youth violence,

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:39.937
and having been the victim
of bullying for most of my life,

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:44.009
this was a subject in which
I felt particularly passionate.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.322
The members of our group came
from many different walks of life.

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:50.330
One day toward the end of the convention,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.418
I found out that one of the kids I had befriended

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.640
was Jewish.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.961
Now, it had taken several days

00:04:56.961 --> 00:04:58.604
for this detail to come to light,

00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:02.364
and I realized that there was no natural animosity

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:04.609
between the two of us.

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:07.665
I had never had a Jewish friend before,

00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:10.474
and frankly I felt a sense of pride

00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:12.459
in having been able to overcome a barrier

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.743
that for most of my life I had been led to believe

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.184
was insurmountable.

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:19.200
Another major turning point came when

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.722
I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:24.114
an amusement park.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:27.010
There, I was exposed to people
from all sorts of faiths and cultures,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.367
and that experience proved to be fundamental

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:33.248
to the development of my character.

00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:34.508
Most of my life, I'd been taught

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:38.254
that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.719
that all gay people were a negative influence.

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.980
As chance would have it, I had the opportunity

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.746
to work with some of the gay performers

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.126
at a show there,

00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:49.660
and soon found that many were the kindest,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.549
least judgmental people I had ever met.

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:55.792
Being bullied as a kid

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:58.080
created a sense of empathy in me

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.626
toward the suffering of others,

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.574
and it comes very unnaturally to me

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:03.542
to treat people who are kind

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:07.570
in any other way than how
I would want to be treated.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.505
Because of that feeling, I was able

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:13.892
to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:17.255
with real life experience and interaction.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:19.597
I don't know what it's like to be gay,

00:06:19.597 --> 00:06:21.260
but I'm well acquainted with being judged

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.236
for something that's beyond my control.

00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:28.971
Then there was "The Daily Show."

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.243
On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me

00:06:31.243 --> 00:06:34.922
to be intellectually honest with
myself about my own bigotry

00:06:34.922 --> 00:06:37.239
and helped me to realize that a person's race,

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:40.335
religion or sexual orientation

00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:44.978
had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:48.353
He was in many ways a father figure to me

00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:51.694
when I was in desperate need of one.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:55.598
Inspiration can often come
from an unexpected place,

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:57.983
and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more

00:06:57.983 --> 00:07:00.323
to positively influence my worldview

00:07:00.323 --> 00:07:02.170
than my own extremist father

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.553
is not lost on me.

00:07:05.553 --> 00:07:07.713
One day, I had a conversation with my mother

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:09.883
about how my worldview was starting to change,

00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:12.559
and she said something to me

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.090
that I will hold dear to my heart

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.339
for as long as I live.

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:18.810
She looked at me with the weary eyes

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.532
of someone who had experienced

00:07:20.532 --> 00:07:24.590
enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.263
"I'm tired of hating people."

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:31.140
In that instant, I realized how much negative energy

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.556
it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.880
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.915
I changed it when my family decided

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:42.580
to end our connection with my father

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.942
and start a new life.

00:07:44.942 --> 00:07:47.100
So why would I out myself

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.500
and potentially put myself in danger?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.368
Well, that's simple.

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:56.130
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.343
who is compelled to use violence

00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:00.704
may hear my story and realize

00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:03.201
that there is a better way,

00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:04.675
that although I had been subjected

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:07.431
to this violent, intolerant ideology,

00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.920
that I did not become fanaticized.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.557
Instead, I choose to use my experience

00:08:12.557 --> 00:08:14.930
to fight back against terrorism,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.321
against the bigotry.

00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:22.109
I do it for the victims of terrorism

00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:24.291
and their loved ones,

00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.124
for the terrible pain and loss

00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:29.325
that terrorism has forced upon their lives.

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.693
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out

00:08:31.693 --> 00:08:34.225
against these senseless acts

00:08:34.225 --> 00:08:38.219
and condemn my father's actions.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.862
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof

00:08:40.862 --> 00:08:45.520
that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.433
and the son does not have to follow

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:51.515
the ways of his father.

00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:54.305
I am not my father.

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:57.205
Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:57.205 --> 00:09:00.864
Thank you, everybody. (Applause)

00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:03.504
Thank you all. (Applause)

00:09:03.504 --> 00:09:07.504
Thanks a lot. (Applause)
