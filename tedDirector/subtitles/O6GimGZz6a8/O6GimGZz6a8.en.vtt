00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Okay, I'm going to show you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
again something about our diets.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And I would like to know what the audience is,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and so who of you ever ate insects?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
That's quite a lot.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
(Laughter)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
But still, you're not representing

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
the overall population of the Earth.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
(Laughter)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
But this is quite good.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And here you see just a selection.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
There's six million species of insects on this planet,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
six million species.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
There's a few hundreds of mammals --

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
six million species of insects.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
we would come at much larger numbers.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
In fact, of all animals on Earth,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
of all animal species,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
80 percent walks on six legs.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
But if we would count all the individuals,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and we take an average weight of them,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
for each of you and me on Earth.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
That means that in terms of biomass,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
insects are more abundant than we are,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and we're not on a planet of men,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
but we're on a planet of insects.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Insects are not only there in nature,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
but they also are involved in our economy,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
usually without us knowing.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
There was an estimation,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
that the U.S. economy

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
benefited by 57 billion

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
dollars per year.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
It's a number -- very large --

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And so I looked up what the economy was paying

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
for the war in Iraq

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
in the same year.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Well we know that that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
was not a cheap war.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
So insects, just for free,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
contribute to the economy of the United States

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
with about the same order of magnitude,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
just for free, without everyone knowing.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And not only in the States,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
but in any country, in any economy.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
What do they do?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
A third of all the fruits that we eat

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
are all a result

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
They control pests,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
and they're food for animals.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
They're at the start of food chains.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
Small animals eat insects.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Even larger animals eat insects.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
But the small animals that eat insects

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
are being eaten by larger animals,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
still larger animals.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And here you see me

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
about two million inhabitants.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
where you can select which fish you want to eat,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
you can select which insects you would like to eat.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And here you see me enjoying a meal

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.260
with caterpillars, locusts,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
bee pupae -- delicacies.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And you can eat something new everyday.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
There's more than 1,000 species of insects

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that are being eaten all around the globe.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
That's quite a bit more

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
than just a few mammals that we're eating,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
like a cow or a pig

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
or a sheep.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
More than 1,000 species --

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
an enormous variety.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
And now you may think, okay,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Well we've seen already that quite some of you

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
already ate insects maybe occasionally,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
but I can tell you that every one of you

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
is eating insects, without any exception.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
You're eating at least

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
500 grams per year.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
What are you eating?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
Tomato soup, peanut butter,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
chocolate, noodles --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
any processed food that you're eating

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
contains insects,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
because insects are here all around us,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
and when they're out there in nature

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
they're also in our crops.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
Some fruits get some insect damage.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
that go to the tomato soup.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And that's your view of a tomato.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and as long as they meet

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
the requirements of the food agency,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
there can be all kinds of things in there,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
no problem.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
there's meat in there anyway?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
In fact, all our processed foods

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
contain more proteins

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
than we would be aware of.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
So anything is a good protein source already.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Now you may say,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We're even doing this on purpose.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
In a lot of food items that we have --

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I have only two items

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
here on the slide --

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
pink cookies or surimi sticks

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
or, if you like, Campari --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
a lot of our food products that are of a red color

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
are dyed with a natural dye.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
The surimi sticks

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
is white fish

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that's being dyed with cochineal.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
Cochineal is a product

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
of an insect that lives off these cacti.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260
It's being produced in large amounts,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
150 to 180 metric tons per year

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
in the Canary Islands in Peru,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
and it's big business.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
One gram of cochineal

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
costs about 30 euros.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
One gram of gold

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
is 30 euros.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So it's a very precious thing

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
that we're using to dye our foods.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Now the situation in the world is going to change

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
The human population is growing very rapidly

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and is growing exponentially.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Where, at the moment, we have

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
something between six and seven billion people,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
it will grow to about nine billion

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
in 2050.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and this is something that worries more and more people.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
There was an FAO conference last October

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
that was completely devoted to this.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
How are we going to feed this world?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
And if you look at the figures up there,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
but we need an agricultural production increase

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
of 70 percent.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And that's especially because this world population

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
is increasing,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and it's increasing, not only in numbers,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
but we're also getting wealthier,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and also starts to eat more meat.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And meat, in fact, is something

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
that costs a lot

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
of our agricultural production.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
and at the moment, most of us here

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
get it from livestock,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
from fish, from game.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And we eat quite a lot of it.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
In the developed world it's on average

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
80 kilograms per person per year,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
which goes up to 120

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
in the United States

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
and a bit lower in some other countries,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
but on average 80 kilograms

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
per person per year.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
In the developing world it's much lower.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
But it's increasing enormously.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
In China in the last 20 years,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
it increased from 20 to 50,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and it's still increasing.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
So if a third of the world population

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
is going to increase its meat consumption

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
from 25 to 80 on average,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
and a third of the world population

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
is living in China and in India,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
we're having an enormous demand on meat.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
And of course, we are not there to say

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
that's only for us, it's not for them.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
They have the same share that we have.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Now to start with, I should say

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
that we are eating way too much meat

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
in the Western world.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
We could do with much, much less --

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
and you can easily do without anything.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
But then there's a lot of problems

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
that come with meat production,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and we're being faced with that more and more often.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
The first problem that we're facing is human health.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
Pigs are quite like us.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
They're even models in medicine,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
And a pig disease,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
a pig virus, and a human virus

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
can both proliferate,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and because of their kind of reproduction,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
they can combine and produce a new virus.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
during the classical swine fever outbreak.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
You get a new disease that can be deadly.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that this doesn't happen.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So that's one point for insects.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
(Laughter)

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And there's the conversion factor.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
You take 10 kilograms of feed,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
you can get one kilogram of beef,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So if you would be an entrepreneur,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
what would you do?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
With 10 kilograms of input,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
you can get either one or nine kg. of output.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So far we're taking

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
the one, or up to five kilograms of output.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
We're not taking the bonus yet.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.260
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
So that's two points for insects.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
(Laughter)

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
And there's the environment.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
If we take 10 kilograms of food --

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
(Laughter)

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
and it results in one kilogram of beef,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
the other nine kilograms are waste,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and a lot of that is manure.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
If you produce insects, you have less manure

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
per kilogram of meat that you produce.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
So less waste.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
you have much, much less ammonia

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and fewer greenhouse gases

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
when you have insect manure

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
than when you have cow manure.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
So you have less waste,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
as it is with cow dung.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
So that's three points for insects.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
(Laughter)

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
Now there's a big "if," of course,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
and it is if insects produce meat

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
that is of good quality.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
Well there have been all kinds of analyses

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
it's very good.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
In fact, it's comparable

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
to anything we eat as meat at the moment.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
One kilogram of grasshoppers

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
has the same amount of calories

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
So that's four points for insects.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.260
(Laughter)

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
I can go on,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
and I could make many more points for insects,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
but time doesn't allow this.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
So the question is, why not eat insects?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
We'll have to.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Even if you don't like it,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
you'll have to get used to this

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
because at the moment,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
70 percent of all our agricultural land

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
is being used to produce livestock.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
That's not only the land

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
where the livestock is walking and feeding,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
but it's also other areas

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
where the feed is being produced and being transported.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
We can increase it a bit

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
at the expense of rainforests,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
but there's a limitation very soon.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And if you remember that we need to increase

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
agricultural production by 70 percent,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
we're not going to make it that way.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
We could much better change

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
from meat, from beef,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
to insects.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
And then 80 percent of the world

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
already eats insects,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
so we are just a minority --

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
in a country like the U.K., the USA,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
the Netherlands, anywhere.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
where they have abundantly present

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So people there are eating them,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
not because they're hungry,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
but because they think it's a delicacy.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It's just very good food.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
You can vary enormously.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
It has many benefits.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
In fact, we have delicacy

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
that's very much like this grasshopper:

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
shrimps, a delicacy

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
being sold at a high price.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
There are a few people who don't like shrimp,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
but shrimp, or crabs,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
or crayfish,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
are very closely related.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
They are delicacies.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and it would make very good into our diet.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
So why are we not eating insects yet?

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
Well that's just a matter of mindset.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
We're not used to it,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
That's why we're changing the perception of insects.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
in telling people what insects are,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
what magnificent things they are,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
what magnificent jobs they do in nature.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And in fact, without insects,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
we would not be here in this room,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
because if the insects die out,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
we will soon die out as well.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
(Laughter)

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And some might think, well they're not yet available.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Well they are.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and one of them is here in the audience,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
not visible, but as animal protein

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
in the food.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
And maybe by 2020,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
A Dutch chocolate maker.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
(Music)

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
(Applause)

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
So there's even a lot of design to it.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
(Laughter)

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
and she puts the insects on the menu

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
in her restaurant in her ministry.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
over to the Hague recently,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
she went to a high-class restaurant,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
and they ate insects all together.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
It's not something that is a hobby of mine.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
It's really taken off the ground.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
So why not eat insects?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
You should try it yourself.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.260
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.260
in a square in Wageningen town,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.260
and they ate insects at the same moment,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
and this was still big, big news.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
because it's just a normal way of doing.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
So you can try it yourself today,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
and I would say, enjoy.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
and he can have the first bite.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:07.260
(Applause)

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.260
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
And it looks delicious.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
They just make it [with] nuts or something.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
MD: Thank you.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
(Applause)
