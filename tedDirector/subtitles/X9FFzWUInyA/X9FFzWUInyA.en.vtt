00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.071
I am a neuroscientist

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.882
with a mixed background in physics and medicine.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:22.923
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.113
focuses on spinal cord injury,

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:28.844
which affects more than 50,000 people

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.534
around the world every year,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:35.140
with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.373
whose life literally shatters

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:40.608
in a matter of a handful of seconds.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:43.666
And for me, the Man of Steel,

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.870
Christopher Reeve,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.960
has best raised the awareness

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.875
on the distress of spinal cord injured people.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.014
And this is how I started my own personal journey

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:55.513
in this field of research,

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.950
working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.546
I still remember this decisive moment.

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:05.497
It was just at the end of a regular day of work

00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:07.040
with the foundation.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.692
Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts,

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:15.285
"You have to be more pragmatic.

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:17.637
When leaving your laboratory tomorrow,

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:20.541
I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.150
to watch injured people

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.175
fighting to take a step,

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:26.816
struggling to maintain their trunk.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.229
And when you go home,

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.639
think of what you are going to change in your research

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.207
on the following day to make their lives better."

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:38.260
These words, they stuck with me.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.651
This was more than 10 years ago,

00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.418
but ever since, my laboratory has followed

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:45.381
the pragmatic approach to recovery

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.792
after spinal cord injury.

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:49.833
And my first step in this direction

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:53.122
was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:56.769
that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:00.141
while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.

00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:02.708
And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:04.123
on opposite sides of the body.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.268
They completely interrupt the communication

00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:08.850
between the brain and the spinal cord,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.560
thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.327
of the leg.

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:17.218
But, as observed, after most injuries in humans,

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:20.168
there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.871
through which recovery can occur.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.912
But how to make it happen?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.273
Well, the classical approach

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:31.909
consists of applying intervention

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.819
that would promote the growth of the severed fiber

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.927
to the original target.

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:40.678
And while this certainly remained the key for a cure,

00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:44.193
this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:46.918
To reach clinical fruition rapidly,

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:48.478
it was obvious:

00:02:48.478 --> 00:02:52.398
I had to think about the problem differently.

00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:55.506
It turned out that more than 100 years of research

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:57.147
on spinal cord physiology,

00:02:57.147 --> 00:02:59.472
starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.279
had shown that

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.514
the spinal cord, below most injuries,

00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:06.767
contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.087
to coordinate locomotion,

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:12.046
but because input from the brain is interrupted,

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.214
they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.

00:03:15.214 --> 00:03:19.546
My idea: We awaken this network.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:23.833
And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.399
after completing my Ph.D. in France,

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.308
where independent thinking

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.415
is not necessarily promoted.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:33.242
(Laughter)

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:36.995
I was afraid to talk to my new boss,

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.388
but decided to muster up my courage.

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:42.045
I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:46.036
Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:48.286
He listened to me carefully,

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:51.227
and responded with a grin.

00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:53.270
"Why don't you try?"

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.395
And I promise to you,

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:58.750
this was such an important moment in my career,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.185
when I realized that the great leader

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.178
believed in young people and new ideas.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.786
And this was the idea:

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:08.452
I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor

00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:10.578
to explain to you this complicated concept.

00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:15.344
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:17.590
The engine is the spinal cord.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.848
The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.

00:04:20.848 --> 00:04:23.855
How could we re-engage the engine?

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.997
First, we have to provide the fuel;

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:29.340
second, press the accelerator pedal;

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.278
third, steer the car.

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:33.040
It turned out that there are known neural pathways

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.994
coming from the brain that play this very function

00:04:35.994 --> 00:04:37.376
during locomotion.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.091
My idea: Replace this missing input

00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:41.493
to provide the spinal cord

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:42.889
with the kind of intervention

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.619
that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:52.058
For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.822
first to replace the missing fuel

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:56.890
with pharmacological agents

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.370
that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.425
and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:05.905
with electrical stimulation.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.074
So here imagine an electrode

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:10.480
implanted on the back of the spinal cord

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.742
to deliver painless stimulation.

00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:15.574
It took many years, but eventually we developed

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:18.131
an electrochemical neuroprosthesis

00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:19.897
that transformed the neural network

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:24.903
in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:31.183
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:33.510
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.316
the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:39.294
but without the brain.

00:05:39.294 --> 00:05:41.284
Here what I call "the spinal brain"

00:05:41.284 --> 00:05:44.406
cognitively processes sensory information

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:46.301
arising from the moving leg

00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.996
and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle

00:05:49.996 --> 00:05:53.386
in order to stand, to walk, to run,

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.498
and even here, while sprinting,

00:05:55.498 --> 00:05:57.795
instantly stand

00:05:57.795 --> 00:06:00.258
if the treadmill stops moving.

00:06:00.258 --> 00:06:01.595
This was amazing.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.982
I was completely fascinated by this locomotion

00:06:04.982 --> 00:06:07.477
without the brain,

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:11.132
but at the same time so frustrated.

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:13.525
This locomotion was completely involuntary.

00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:16.890
The animal had virtually no control over the legs.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.010
Clearly, the steering system was missing.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.902
And it then became obvious from me

00:06:22.902 --> 00:06:24.250
that we had to move away

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.622
from the classical rehabilitation paradigm,

00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:29.344
stepping on a treadmill,

00:06:29.344 --> 00:06:32.564
and develop conditions that would encourage

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:37.797
the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:41.182
With this in mind, we developed a completely new

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:44.412
robotic system to support the rat

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.938
in any direction of space.

00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:49.113
Imagine, this is really cool.

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:52.944
So imagine the little 200-gram rat

00:06:52.944 --> 00:06:56.645
attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,

00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:59.217
but the rat does not feel the robot.

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:01.289
The robot is transparent,

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.651
just like you would hold a young child

00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.015
during the first insecure steps.

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:09.569
Let me summarize: The rat received

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.014
a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:14.604
The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:18.811
a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:22.577
The robot provided the safe environment

00:07:22.577 --> 00:07:24.540
to allow the rat to attempt anything

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.222
to engage the paralyzed legs.

00:07:27.222 --> 00:07:30.047
And for motivation, we used what I think

00:07:30.047 --> 00:07:33.881
is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:

00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:36.188
fine Swiss chocolate.

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:39.110
(Laughter)

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.673
Actually, the first results were very, very,

00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:46.308
very disappointing.

00:07:46.308 --> 00:07:49.610
Here is my best physical therapist

00:07:56.794 --> 00:07:59.384
completely failing to encourage the rat

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.445
to take a single step,

00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:04.291
whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,

00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:06.597
walked beautifully on the treadmill.

00:08:06.597 --> 00:08:08.754
We were so frustrated.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.653
But you know, one of the most essential qualities

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:14.129
of a scientist is perseverance.

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.545
We insisted. We refined our paradigm,

00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:19.808
and after several months of training,

00:08:19.808 --> 00:08:23.614
the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,

00:08:23.614 --> 00:08:25.426
and whenever she decided,

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:27.758
initiated full weight-bearing locomotion

00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:31.008
to sprint towards the rewards.

00:08:31.008 --> 00:08:34.413
This is the first recovery ever observed

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.307
of voluntary leg movement

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.761
after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:42.222
leading to complete and permanent paralysis.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:44.209
In fact --

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:45.929
(Applause)

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:50.308
Thank you.

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:53.402
In fact, not only could the rat initiate

00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:56.079
and sustain locomotion on the ground,

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:58.360
they could even adjust leg movement,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.716
for example, to resist gravity

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:03.340
in order to climb a staircase.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.290
I can promise you this was

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.399
such an emotional moment in my laboratory.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.142
It took us 10 years of hard work

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:13.593
to reach this goal.

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:16.144
But the remaining question was, how?

00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:17.836
I mean, how is it possible?

00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:19.514
And here, what we found

00:09:19.514 --> 00:09:23.190
was completely unexpected.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.348
This novel training paradigm

00:09:27.348 --> 00:09:31.019
encouraged the brain to create new connections,

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:33.921
some relay circuits

00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:36.969
that relay information from the brain

00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:40.125
past the injury and restore cortical control

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:43.566
over the locomotor networks below the injury.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.488
And here, you can see one such example,

00:09:46.488 --> 00:09:49.851
where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.

00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:53.271
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,

00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.634
and what this constellation

00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:57.985
of synaptic contacts means

00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:01.784
is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:05.782
with only one relay neuron.

00:10:05.782 --> 00:10:07.713
But the remodeling was not restricted

00:10:07.713 --> 00:10:08.800
to the lesion area.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.089
It occurred throughout the central nervous system,

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:14.407
including in the brain stem,

00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:17.669
where we observed up to 300-percent increase

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:21.428
in the density of fibers coming from the brain.

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:24.955
We did not aim to repair the spinal cord,

00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:27.552
yet we were able to promote

00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:29.709
one of the more extensive remodeling

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:32.178
of axonal projections ever observed

00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:34.439
in the central nervous system of adult mammal

00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:36.984
after an injury.

00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:42.053
And there is a very important message

00:10:42.053 --> 00:10:46.496
hidden behind this discovery.

00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:49.718
They are the result of a young team

00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:52.110
of very talented people:

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.568
physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,

00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:58.767
engineers of all kinds,

00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:00.558
who have achieved together

00:11:00.558 --> 00:11:04.201
what would have been impossible by single individuals.

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.284
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team.

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:09.472
They are working so close to each other

00:11:09.472 --> 00:11:12.663
that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.

00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:14.286
We are creating the next generation

00:11:14.286 --> 00:11:16.527
of M.D.'s and engineers

00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:18.971
capable of translating discoveries all the way

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:21.643
from bench to bedside.

00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:23.649
And me?

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:28.196
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:34.999
Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:38.763
will this help injured people?

00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:42.655
Me too, every day.

00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:46.068
The truth is that we don't know enough yet.

00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:50.292
This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:53.026
but I begin to believe that this may lead

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:55.593
to an intervention to improve recovery

00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:58.780
and people's quality of life.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.269
I would like you all

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.896
to take a moment and dream with me.

00:12:04.896 --> 00:12:10.791
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.

00:12:10.791 --> 00:12:13.946
After a few weeks of recovery,

00:12:13.946 --> 00:12:16.306
we will implant a programmable pump

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:19.339
to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.781
directly to the spinal cord.

00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:25.044
At the same time, we will implant an electrode array,

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.151
a sort of second skin

00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:30.711
covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,

00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:33.977
and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator

00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:36.439
that delivers stimulations that are tailored

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:38.625
to the person's needs.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:43.483
This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis

00:12:43.483 --> 00:12:46.234
that will enable locomotion

00:12:46.234 --> 00:12:50.281
during training with a newly designed supporting system.

00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:53.564
And my hope is that after several months of training,

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.727
there may be enough remodeling of residual connection

00:12:55.727 --> 00:12:59.396
to allow locomotion without the robot,

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:03.174
maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.

00:13:03.174 --> 00:13:05.708
My hope here is to be able to create

00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:07.973
the personalized condition

00:13:07.973 --> 00:13:10.636
to boost the plasticity of the brain

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:12.167
and the spinal cord.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.906
And this is a radically new concept

00:13:14.906 --> 00:13:18.199
that may apply to other neurological disorders,

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:22.737
what I termed "personalized neuroprosthetics,"

00:13:22.737 --> 00:13:25.761
where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,

00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:29.475
I implanted throughout the nervous system,

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.816
in the brain, in the spinal cord,

00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:35.572
even in peripheral nerves,

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:38.739
based on patient-specific impairments.

00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:43.347
But not to replace the lost function, no --

00:13:43.347 --> 00:13:46.538
to help the brain help itself.

00:13:46.538 --> 00:13:49.178
And I hope this enticed your imagination,

00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.074
because I can promise to you

00:13:51.074 --> 00:13:54.317
this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,

00:13:54.317 --> 00:13:56.109
but when.

00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:58.342
And remember, we are only as great

00:13:58.357 --> 00:14:01.942
as our imagination, as big as our dream.

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:03.934
Thank you.

00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:07.934
(Applause)
