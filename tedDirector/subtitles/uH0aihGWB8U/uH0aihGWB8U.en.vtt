00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:19.804
(Clicking)

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:24.420
I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.353
retinal cancer.

00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:30.419
My right eye was removed

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.336
at seven months of age.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:37.053
I was 13 months
when they removed my left eye.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:43.148
The first thing I did
upon awakening from that last surgery

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:46.780
was to climb out of my crib

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.889
and begin wandering around
the intensive care nursery,

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.208
probably looking for the one
who did this to me.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.066
(Laughter)

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.127
Evidently, wandering around the nursery

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:05.702
was not a problem for me without eyes.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.337
The problem was getting caught.

00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:12.731
It's impressions about blindness

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.221
that are far more threatening

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.753
to blind people than the blindness itself.

00:01:21.283 --> 00:01:25.230
Think for a moment about
your own impressions of blindness.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.296
Think about your reactions
when I first came onto the stage,

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.347
or the prospect of your own blindness,

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:37.264
or a loved one going blind.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:42.704
The terror is incomprehensible
to most of us,

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:45.159
because blindness

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.829
is thought to epitomize ignorance
and unawareness,

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:58.630
hapless exposure to the ravages
of the dark unknown.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.460
How poetic.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.801
Fortunately for me,
my parents were not poetic.

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.676
They were pragmatic.

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:13.293
They understood that ignorance and fear
were but matters of the mind,

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:17.282
and the mind is adaptable.

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:20.983
They believed that I should grow up

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:25.814
to enjoy the same freedoms
and responsibilities as everyone else.

00:02:25.814 --> 00:02:28.275
In their own words, I would move out --

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:31.062
which I did when I was 18 --

00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:33.035
I will pay taxes --

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.875
thanks --
(Laughter) --

00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:42.786
and they knew the difference
between love and fear.

00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:47.710
Fear immobilizes us
in the face of challenge.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.612
They knew that blindness
would pose a significant challenge.

00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:53.666
I was not raised with fear.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:57.415
They put my freedom first before all else,

00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:00.535
because that is what love does.

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:04.764
Now, moving forward,
how do I manage today?

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:09.419
The world is a much larger nursery.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.320
Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.014
longer than the canes
used by most blind people.

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:19.357
I call it my freedom staff.

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:20.913
It will keep me, for example,

00:03:20.913 --> 00:03:26.529
from making an undignified 
departure from the stage. (Laughter)

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.242
I do see that cliff edge.

00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:33.509
They warned us earlier
that every imaginable mishap

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.100
has occurred to speakers
up here on the stage.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.121
I don't care to set a new precedent.

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:42.425
But beyond that,

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:45.552
many of you may have heard me clicking
as I came onto the stage --

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:46.619
(Clicking) --

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.488
with my tongue.

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:51.666
Those are flashes of sound

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:56.746
that go out and reflect
from surfaces all around me,

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.118
just like a bat's sonar,

00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:03.738
and return to me with patterns, 
with pieces of information,

00:04:03.738 --> 00:04:06.225
much as light does for you.

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.793
And my brain, thanks to my parents,

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:16.098
has been activated to form images
in my visual cortex,

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:19.338
which we now call the imaging system,

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:23.288
from those patterns of information,
much as your brain does.

00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:25.854
I call this process flash sonar.

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:32.322
It is how I have learned to see
through my blindness,

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:35.498
to navigate my journey

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:39.538
through the dark unknowns
of my own challenges,

00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:43.439
which has earned me the moniker

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.154
"the remarkable Batman."

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.708
Now, Batman I will accept.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:53.098
Bats are cool. Batman is cool.

00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:58.766
But I was not raised to think of myself
as in any way remarkable.

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:03.884
I have always regarded myself
much like anyone else

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:09.300
who navigates the dark unknowns
of their own challenges.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.718
Is that so remarkable?

00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:16.014
I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:19.317
Now, someone, somewhere,

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:23.144
must think that's remarkable,
or I wouldn't be up here,

00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:26.183
but let's consider this for a moment.

00:05:27.013 --> 00:05:29.739
Everyone out there

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:34.428
who faces or who has ever
faced a challenge,

00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:36.160
raise your hands.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.490
Whoosh. Okay.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.462
Lots of hands going up, a moment,
let me do a head count.

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:44.503
(Clicking)

00:05:45.713 --> 00:05:48.731
This will take a while.
(Clicking) (Laughter)

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.205
Okay, lots of hands in the air.

00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:52.609
Keep them up. I have an idea.

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:58.302
Those of you who use your brains
to navigate these challenges,

00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:01.243
put your hands down.

00:06:02.423 --> 00:06:05.024
Okay, anyone with your hands still up

00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:10.262
has challenges of your own. (Laughter)

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.839
So we all face challenges,

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.577
and we all face the dark unknown,

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:20.920
which is endemic to most challenges,
which is what most of us fear, okay?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.773
But we all have brains

00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:29.069
that allow us, that activate to allow us

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:35.456
to navigate the journey
through these challenges. Okay?

00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:40.284
Case in point: I came up here

00:06:40.284 --> 00:06:47.254
and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:50.152
where the lectern was.

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:53.066
So you can't trust those TED folks.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.653
"Find it yourself," they said.

00:06:56.653 --> 00:07:00.063
So -- (Laughter)

00:07:01.413 --> 00:07:04.525
And the feedback for the P.A. system
is no help at all.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.934
So now I present to you a challenge.

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:11.850
So if you'd all close your eyes
for just a moment, okay?

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.507
And you're going to learn
a bit of flash sonar.

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:17.017
I'm going to make a sound.

00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:20.562
I'm going to hold this panel in front 
of me, but I'm not going to move it.

00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:23.486
Just listen to the sound for a moment.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:31.228
Shhhhhhhhhh.

00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:33.293
Okay, nothing very interesting.

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:36.032
Now, listen to what happens
to that same exact sound

00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:37.816
when I move the panel.

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:45.111
Shhhhhhhhhhh. 
(Pitch getting higher and lower)

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:53.609
You do not know the power
of the dark side.

00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:55.421
(Laughter)

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.812
I couldn't resist.

00:07:59.832 --> 00:08:02.479
Okay, now keep your eyes closed

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.327
because, did you hear the difference?

00:08:04.327 --> 00:08:07.425
Okay. Now, let's be sure.

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.224
For your challenge,

00:08:09.224 --> 00:08:14.308
you tell me, just say "now"
when you hear the panel start to move.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:17.300
Okay? We'll relax into this.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.823
Shhhhhhh.

00:08:23.823 --> 00:08:25.888
Audience: Now.
Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:27.381
Open your eyes.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:31.915
All right. So just a few centimeters,

00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.045
you would notice the difference.

00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:36.488
You've experienced sonar.

00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:40.547
You'd all make great blind people.
(Laughter)

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:43.240
Let's have a look at what can happen

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.584
when this activation process

00:08:46.584 --> 00:08:51.111
is given some time and attention.

00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:54.292
(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like
you guys can see with your eyes

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:57.497
and we can see with our ears.

00:08:57.497 --> 00:09:00.561
Brian Bushway: It's not a matter
of enjoying it more or less,

00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:03.487
it's about enjoying it differently.

00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:06.529
Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.
DK: Yeah.

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:10.337
SM: And then it's gradually
coming back down again.

00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:11.950
DK: Yes!
SM: That's amazing.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.246
I can, like, see the car. Holy mother!

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:24.048
J. Louchart: I love being blind.

00:09:24.048 --> 00:09:27.716
If I had the opportunity, honestly,
I wouldn't go back to being sighted.

00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:31.176
JR: The bigger the goal,
the more obstacles you'll face,

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:33.777
and on the other side of that goal

00:09:33.777 --> 00:09:35.425
is victory.

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:40.580
[In Italian]

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:50.355
(Applause)

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:54.245
DK: Now, do these people look terrified?

00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.067
Not so much.

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:58.853
We have delivered activation training

00:09:58.853 --> 00:10:02.382
to tens of thousands of blind
and sighted people from all backgrounds

00:10:02.382 --> 00:10:04.820
in nearly 40 countries.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.302
When blind people learn to see,

00:10:09.302 --> 00:10:12.320
sighted people seem inspired

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.377
to want to learn to see their way
better, more clearly, with less fear,

00:10:18.627 --> 00:10:24.533
because this exemplifies
the immense capacity within us all

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:31.046
to navigate any type of challenge,
through any form of darkness,

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:34.332
to discoveries unimagined

00:10:34.332 --> 00:10:39.695
when we are activated.

00:10:39.695 --> 00:10:45.709
I wish you all a most activating journey.

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:47.474
Thank you very much.

00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:54.695
(Applause)

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:58.162
Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.

00:10:58.162 --> 00:11:03.297
As I know you can see, it's
a spectacular standing ovation at TED.

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:06.281
Thank you for an extraordinary talk.

00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:11.530
Just one more question about your world,
your inner world that you construct.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:17.095
We think that we have things in our world
that you as a blind person don't have,

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:18.819
but what's your world like?

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:21.582
What do you have that we don't have?

00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:24.717
DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:28.618
so my sonar works about as well
behind me as it does in front of me.

00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.499
It works around corners.

00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:33.238
It works through surfaces.

00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:39.229
Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy
three-dimensional geometry.

00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:43.269
One of my students, who has now
become an instructor,

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.195
when he lost his vision,
after a few months

00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:48.447
he was sitting in his three story house

00:11:48.447 --> 00:11:52.464
and he realized that he could hear
everything going on throughout the house:

00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:56.643
conversations, people in the kitchen,
people in the bathroom,

00:11:56.643 --> 00:11:59.337
several floors away, several walls away.

00:11:59.337 --> 00:12:02.889
He said it was something
like having x-ray vision.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:06.511
CA: What do you picture
that you're in right now?

00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:09.530
How do you picture this theater?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:15.033
DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.

00:12:16.453 --> 00:12:20.709
It's interesting. 
When people make a sound,

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:25.864
when they laugh, when they fidget,
when they take a drink or blow their nose

00:12:25.864 --> 00:12:28.557
or whatever, I hear everything.

00:12:28.557 --> 00:12:31.738
I hear every little movement
that every single person makes.

00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:34.501
None of it really escapes my attention,

00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:36.355
and then, from a sonar perspective,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:42.209
the size of the room, the curvature 
of the audience around the stage,

00:12:42.209 --> 00:12:45.847
it's the height of the room.

00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:49.127
Like I say, it's all that kind 
of three-dimensional surface geometry

00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:50.544
all around me.
