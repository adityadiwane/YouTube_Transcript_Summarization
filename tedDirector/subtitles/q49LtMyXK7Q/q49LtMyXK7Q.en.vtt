00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.362
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:22.491
This might be the most
important sneaker in history.

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.914
First released in 1988,

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:28.479
this is the shoe that started
Nike marketing as we know it.

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:32.840
This is the shoe that propelled
the entire Air Jordan lineage,

00:00:32.864 --> 00:00:34.883
and perhaps saved Nike.

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:37.820
The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
did for sneakers

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:39.635
what the iPhone did for phones.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.130
It's been re-released four times.

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:44.781
Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:47.460
There's a site about what to wear
with the Black Cement.

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:50.124
It's been right under
your nose for decades

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:52.130
and you never looked down.

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:54.343
And right about now,

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.766
most of you are probably
thinking, "Sneakers?"

00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:00.052
(Laughter)

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:01.238
Yes.

00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:02.833
Yes, sneakers.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:07.388
Some extraordinary things about sneakers

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.001
and data

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:10.500
and Nike

00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:14.753
and how they're all related, possibly,
to the future of all online commerce.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.419
In 2011,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.422
the last time the Jordan 3
Black Cement was released,

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.779
at a retail of 160 dollars,

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:24.262
it sold out globally in minutes.

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:27.279
And that's because people were camped
outside of sneaker stores

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:29.074
for days before it went on sale.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.843
And just minutes after that,

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:34.402
thousands of those pairs were on eBay
for two and three times retail.

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:39.304
In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay
right now, four years later.

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.705
But here's the thing:

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.187
this happens every single Saturday.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.107
Every week there's another
release or two or three,

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.385
and every shoe has a story

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.339
as rich and compelling
as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.225
This is Nike building
the marketplace for sneakerheads --

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.025
people who collect sneakers --

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.297
and my daughter.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.246
(Laughter)

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.337
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.413
For the brands, sneakerheads
are a very important demographic.

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:15.359
These are the tastemakers;
these are the Apple fanboys.

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:16.922
Because who else is going to buy

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:20.162
a pair of $8,000
Back to the Future sneakers?

00:02:20.603 --> 00:02:22.441
(Laughter)

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:24.542
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.

00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:27.715
And while that's obviously the anomaly,

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.917
the resell sneaker market
is definitely not.

00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:32.765
Thirty years in the making,

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.725
what started as an underground culture

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.730
of a few people who like sneakers
just a bit too much --

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:39.154
(Laughter)

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:42.734
Now we have sneaker addictions.

00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:44.686
In a market where in the past 12 months,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.964
there have been over
nine million pairs of shoes

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:49.381
resold in the United States alone,

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:53.645
at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.708
And that's a conservative estimate --

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:58.935
I should know, I am a sneakerhead.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.466
This is my collection.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.876
In the pantheon of great collections,
mine doesn't even register.

00:03:05.392 --> 00:03:08.438
I have about 250 pairs,
but trust me, I am small-time.

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.417
People have thousands.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.443
I'm a very typical
37-year-old sneakerhead.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.772
I grew up playing basketball
when Michael Jordan played,

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.136
I always wanted Air Jordans,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.129
my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,

00:03:20.153 --> 00:03:22.546
as soon as I got some money
I bought Air Jordans --

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.643
literally, we all have
the exact same story.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:26.362
But here's where mine diverged.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:31.261
After starting three companies,
I took a job as a strategy consultant,

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:35.199
when I very quickly realized that
I didn't know the first thing about data.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.738
But I learned, because I had to,

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:40.056
and I liked it.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.492
So I thought, I wonder if I could
get ahold of some sneaker data,

00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:45.528
just to play with for my own amusement.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.822
The goal was to develop a price guide,

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.043
a real data-driven view of the market.

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:54.702
And four years later, we're analyzing
over 25 million transactions,

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:57.642
providing real-time analytics
on thousands of sneakers.

00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.882
Now sneakerheads check prices
while camping out for releases.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.690
Others have used the data
to validate insurance claims.

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.762
And the top investment banks in the world

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:13.392
now use resell data to analyze
the retail footwear industry.

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:15.006
And here's the best part:

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.559
sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:20.085
(Laughter)

00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:23.590
Sneakerheads can track the value
of their collection over time,

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:24.765
compare it to others,

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.019
and have access to the same
analytics you might

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:28.963
for your online brokerage account.

00:04:28.987 --> 00:04:33.891
So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection
and identifies which 352 are his.

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.804
He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --

00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:38.829
frankly, a modest collection.

00:04:38.853 --> 00:04:42.462
At the asset level,
he can see gain-loss by shoe.

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:45.000
Here he's made over
600 dollars on one pair.

00:04:46.183 --> 00:04:47.514
I have one of those.

00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:49.117
(Laughter)

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:54.102
So an unregulated
1.2 billion dollar industry

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.695
that thrives as much on the street
as it does online,

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.465
and has spawned fundamental
financial services for sneakers?

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:04.249
At some point I asked myself
what's really going on in the market,

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:06.588
and two comparisons started to emerge.

00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:10.363
Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:11.588
(Laughter)

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.480
In fact, one guy emailed to say

00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:17.768
he thought his 15-year-old son
was selling drugs

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:20.323
and later found out
he was selling sneakers.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.014
(Laughter)

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:25.288
And now they use the data
to do it together.

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.409
And that's because sneakers
are an investment opportunity

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.592
where none other exists.

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:32.653
And I don't just mean the kid
selling sneakers instead of drugs.

00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:34.367
How about all kids?

00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.144
You have to be 18
to play the stock market.

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:40.307
I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.909
Blow Pops in ninth grade

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:44.354
and collected baseball cards
through high school.

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:46.175
The cards are long dead,

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.572
and the candy market's
usually quite local.

00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:54.849
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal
and accessible investment opportunity --

00:05:54.873 --> 00:05:58.640
a democratized stock market,

00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:00.735
but also unregulated.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.541
Which is why the story
you're probably most familiar with

00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:05.980
is people killing each other for sneakers.

00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:10.381
And while that definitely
happens and is tragic,

00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:14.250
it's not nearly the epidemic
some media would have you believe.

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:18.459
In fact, it's a very small piece
of a much bigger and better story.

00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:20.179
So sneakers have clear similarities

00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:23.307
to both the stock exchange
and the illegal drug trade,

00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:27.728
but perhaps the most fundamental
is the existence of a central actor.

00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:29.735
Someone is making the rules.

00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:34.981
In the case of sneakers,
that someone is Nike.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.162
Let me walk you through some numbers.

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:41.422
The resell market,
we know, is $1.2 billion.

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.744
Nike, including Jordan brand,

00:06:43.768 --> 00:06:48.284
accounts for 96 percent of all shoes
sold on the secondary market.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:49.900
Just complete domination.

00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:52.512
Sneakerheads love Jordans.

00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:55.547
And profit on the secondary market
is about a third.

00:06:55.571 --> 00:07:00.641
That means that sneakerheads
made 380 million dollars

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:02.553
selling Nikes last year.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.047
Let's jump to retail for a second.

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:06.491
Skechers, earlier this year,

00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:09.305
became the number two
footwear brand in the country,

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:12.163
surpassing Adidas --
this was a big deal.

00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:14.961
And in the 12 months ending in June,

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:19.049
Skechers's net income
was 209 million dollars.

00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:23.187
That means that Nike's customers

00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.747
make almost twice as much profit
as their closest competitor.

00:07:27.758 --> 00:07:29.557
That --

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:33.005
(Laughter)

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.605
How is that even possible?

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.830
The sneaker market
is just supply and demand,

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:43.576
but Nike's gotten very good at using
supply -- limited sneakers --

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.413
and the distribution of those sneakers
to their own benefit.

00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:49.449
So it's really just supply.

00:07:49.473 --> 00:07:53.238
Sneakerheads joke that as long
as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.

00:07:53.262 --> 00:07:57.071
Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars
do so because they're very rare.

00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:59.861
It's no different than any other
collectible market,

00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:02.965
only this isn't a market at all.

00:08:03.508 --> 00:08:05.953
It's a false construct created by Nike --

00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:10.258
ingeniously created by Nike, in the most
positive sense -- to sell more shoes.

00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:11.764
And in the process,

00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:15.156
it provided tens of thousands of people
with life-long passions,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.661
myself included.

00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:20.703
If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,
they could do so tomorrow,

00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:22.759
all they have to do is release more shoes.

00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:26.300
But we certainly don't want them to,
nor is it in their best interest.

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:31.582
That's because unlike Apple, who will sell
an iPhone to anyone who wants one,

00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:35.424
Nike doesn't make their money
by just selling $200 sneakers.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:38.699
They sell millions of shoes to millions
of people for 60 dollars.

00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:41.685
And sneakerheads are the ones
who drive the marketing

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:44.239
and the hype and the PR
and the brand cachet,

00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:47.803
and enable Nike to sell millions
of $60 sneakers.

00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:50.882
It's marketing.

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:54.018
It's marketing the likes of which
has never been seen before --

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.462
this isn't in any textbook.

00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:59.026
For 15 years Nike has propped up
an artificial commodities market,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.513
with a Facebook-level hyped IPO
every single weekend.

00:09:03.537 --> 00:09:06.210
Drive by any Footlocker at 8am
on a Saturday morning,

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:09.185
and there will be a line down the street
and around the block,

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:12.070
and sometimes those kids
have been waiting there all week.

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:16.208
You know those crazy iPhone lines
you see on the news every other year?

00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:20.522
Nike lines happen 104 times more often.

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:22.603
So Nike sets the rules.

00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:25.401
And they do so by controlling
supply and distribution.

00:09:26.014 --> 00:09:29.911
But once a pair leaves
the retail channel, it's the Wild West.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.003
There are very few -- if any --
legal, unregulated markets of this size.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.803
So Nike is definitely
not the stock exchange.

00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:42.610
In fact, there is no central exchange.

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:47.372
By last count, there were 48 different
online markets that I know of.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.478
Some are eBay clones,
some are mobile markets,

00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:54.524
and then you have consignment shops
and brick-and-mortar stores,

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:56.612
and sneaker conventions,
and reseller sites,

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:59.041
and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:02.597
literally, anywhere sneakerheads
come into contact with each other,

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:04.611
shoes will be bought and sold.

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:10.515
But that means no efficiencies,
no transparency,

00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:12.755
sometimes not even authenticity.

00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:16.377
Can you imagine if that's
how stocks were bought?

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:19.409
What if the way to buy
a share of Apple stock

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:22.288
was to search over 100 places
online and off,

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.535
including every time
you walk down the street

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:27.197
just hoping to pass someone
wearing some Apple stock?

00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:29.088
Never knowing who had the best price,

00:10:29.112 --> 00:10:31.679
or even if the stock
you were looking at was real.

00:10:31.703 --> 00:10:33.520
That would surely make you say:

00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:35.598
[WTF?]

00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:37.909
Of course that's not how we buy stock.

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:41.923
But what if that's not how
we need to buy sneakers either?

00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:44.305
What if the inverse is true,

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:45.915
and what if we could buy sneakers

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:47.732
exactly the same way as we buy stock?

00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:50.645
And what if it wasn't just sneakers,
but any similar product,

00:10:50.669 --> 00:10:52.772
like watches and handbags
and women's shoes,

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:56.144
and any collectible, any seasonal item
and any markdown item?

00:10:56.168 --> 00:10:59.411
What if there was
a stock market for commerce?

00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:02.868
A stock market of things.

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:08.490
And not only could you buy in a much more
educated and efficient manner,

00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:11.754
but you could engage in all
the sophisticated financial transactions

00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:13.361
you can with the stock market.

00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:14.988
Shorts and options and futures

00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:18.122
and well, maybe you see
where this is going.

00:11:18.146 --> 00:11:22.069
Maybe you want to invest
in a stock market of things.

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:29.269
Because if you had invested in a pair
of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:31.690
you could either be wearing them onstage,

00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:33.633
(Laughter)

00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:36.954
or have earned 162 percent
on your money --

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.015
double the S&amp;P and 20 percent
more than Apple.

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:42.758
(Laughter)

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.664
And that's why
we're talking about sneakers.

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:47.379
Thank you.

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:50.325
(Applause)
