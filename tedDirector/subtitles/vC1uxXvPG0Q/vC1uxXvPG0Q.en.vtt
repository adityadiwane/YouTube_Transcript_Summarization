00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:15.897
Design is a slippery
and elusive phenomenon,

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:19.182
which has meant different
things at different times.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:23.474
But all truly inspiring design projects
have one thing in common:

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:25.324
they began with a dream.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.117
And the bolder the dream,

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:30.782
the greater the design feat
that will be required to achieve it.

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:34.700
And this is why the greatest
designers are almost always

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:38.412
the biggest dreamers
and rebels and renegades.

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:41.570
This has been the case throughout history,

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:45.515
all the way back to the year 300 BC,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.658
when a 13-year-old became the king

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:53.125
of a remote, very poor
and very small Asian country.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.960
He dreamt of acquiring land,
riches and power

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:58.651
through military conquest.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.058
And his design skills --

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.905
improbable though it sounds --

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.974
would be essential
in enabling him to do so.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:06.755
At the time,

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:10.189
all weapons were made by hand
to different specifications.

00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:13.519
So if an archer ran out
of arrows during a battle,

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:17.466
they wouldn't necessarily be able
to fire another archer's arrows

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.338
from their bow.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.923
This of course meant that they would
be less effective in combat

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:24.851
and very vulnerable, too.

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:26.941
Ying solved this problem

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:31.056
by insisting that all bows and arrows
were designed identically,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.811
so they were interchangeable.

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:36.837
And he did the same for daggers,
axes, spears, shields

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:39.346
and every other form of weaponry.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.908
His formidably equipped army
won batter after battle,

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.722
and within 15 years,

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:48.904
his tiny kingdom had
succeeded in conquering

00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:51.753
all its larger, richer,
more powerful neighbors,

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:54.300
to found the mighty Chinese Empire.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.570
Now, no one, of course,

00:01:56.594 --> 00:02:00.372
would have thought of describing
Ying Zheng as a designer at the time --

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:01.604
why would they?

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:05.431
And yet he used design
unknowingly and instinctively

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.415
but with tremendous ingenuity

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.607
to achieve his ends.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:14.171
And so did another equally
improbable, accidental designer,

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.950
who was also not above using
violence to get what he wanted.

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:23.636
This was Edward Teach, better known
as the British pirate, Blackbeard.

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:26.277
This was the golden age of piracy,

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:29.974
where pirates like Teach
were terrorizing the high seas.

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:31.967
Colonial trade was flourishing,

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.252
and piracy was highly profitable.

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:39.115
And the smarter pirates like him
realized that to maximize their spoils,

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.766
they needed to attack
their enemies so brutally

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.583
that they would surrender on sight.

00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:46.758
So in other words,

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:49.328
they could take the ships
without wasting ammunition,

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:51.393
or incurring casualties.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:55.082
So Edward Teach redesigned
himself as Blackbeard

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.358
by playing the part of a merciless brute.

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.819
He wore heavy jackets and big hats
to accentuate his height.

00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:05.338
He grew the bushy black beard
that obscured his face.

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:08.909
He slung braces of pistols
on either shoulder.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:12.831
He even attached matches to the brim
of his hat and set them alight,

00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:16.985
so they sizzled menacingly
whenever his ship was poised to attack.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.581
And like many pirates of that era,

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:22.494
he flew a flag that bore
the macabre symbols

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.978
of a human skull
and a pair of crossed bones,

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:31.693
because those motifs had signified death
in so many cultures for centuries,

00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:34.579
that their meaning
was instantly recognizable,

00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:38.143
even in the lawless, illiterate
world of the high seas:

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.643
surrender or you'll suffer.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.922
So of course, all his sensible
victims surrendered on sight.

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:45.976
Put like that,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.675
it's easy to see why Edward Teach
and his fellow pirates

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.174
could be seen as pioneers
of modern communications design,

00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:57.122
and why their deadly symbol --

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:58.208
(Laughter)

00:03:58.232 --> 00:03:59.383
there's more --

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:02.392
why their deadly symbol
of the skull and crossbones

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:04.706
was a precursor of today's logos,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.077
rather like the big red letters
standing behind me,

00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:10.280
but of course with a different message.

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:11.308
(Laughter)

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:14.342
Yet design was also used to nobler ends

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:18.580
by an equally brilliant and equally
improbable designer,

00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:22.440
the 19th-century British nurse,
Florence Nightingale.

00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:26.783
Her mission was to provide
decent healthcare for everyone.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.783
Nightingale was born into a rather
grand, very wealthy British family,

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:35.848
who were horrified when she volunteered
to work in military hospitals

00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:37.506
during the Crimean War.

00:04:37.963 --> 00:04:40.292
Once there, she swiftly realized

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:43.929
that more patients were dying
of infections that they caught there,

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:45.921
in the filthy, fetid wards,

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:47.698
than they were of battle wounds.

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:52.008
So she campaigned
for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:53.788
to be designed and built.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.574
Back in Britain,

00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:57.088
she mounted another campaign,

00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:59.170
this time for civilian hospitals,

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:03.067
and insisted that the same design
principles were applied to them.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:06.248
The Nightingale ward, as it is called,

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.952
dominated hospital design
for decades to come,

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.018
and elements of it are still used today.

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:15.089
But by then,

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:18.141
design was seen as a tool
of the Industrial Age.

00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:20.891
It was formalized and professionalized,

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:23.408
but it was restricted to specific roles

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:26.510
and generally applied in pursuit
of commercial goals

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.809
rather than being used intuitively,

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:33.059
as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard
and Ying Zheng had done.

00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:34.882
By the 20th century,

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:37.919
this commercial ethos was so powerful,

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:40.467
that any designers who deviated from it

00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:44.098
risked being seen as cranks
or subversives.

00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:48.354
Now among them is one
of my great design heroes,

00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:50.906
the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.697
He was the Hungarian artist and designer

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:57.977
whose experiments with the impact
of technology on daily life

00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:59.167
were so powerful

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:02.491
that they still influence
the design of the digital images

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:05.237
we see on our phone and computer screens.

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:10.355
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design
School in 1920s Germany,

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.126
and yet some of his former
colleagues shunned him

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.768
when he struggled to open a new
Bauhaus in Chicago years later.

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:22.408
Moholy's ideas were as bold
and incisive as ever,

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:26.159
but his approach to design
was too experimental,

00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:29.667
as was his insistence
on seeing it, as he put it,

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.990
as an attitude, not a profession
to be in tune with the times.

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.635
And sadly, the same applied

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.143
to another design maverick:
Richard Buckminster Fuller.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.857
He was yet another
brilliant design visionary

00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:46.298
and design activist,

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:50.886
who was completely committed
to designing a sustainable society

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.790
in such a forward-thinking way

00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:56.154
that he started talking about
the importance of environmentalism

00:06:56.178 --> 00:06:58.931
in design in the 1920s.

00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:02.085
Now he, despite his efforts,

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:06.842
was routinely mocked as a crank
by many in the design establishment,

00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:08.034
and admittedly,

00:07:08.058 --> 00:07:09.851
some of his experiments failed,

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.869
like the flying car
that never got off the ground.

00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:14.941
And yet, the geodesic dome,

00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:18.289
his design formula to build
an emergency shelter

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.994
from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,

00:07:21.018 --> 00:07:24.264
bits of tree, old blankets,
plastic sheeting --

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:27.035
just about anything
that's available at the time --

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:30.630
is one of the greatest feats
of humanitarian design,

00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:33.317
and has provided sorely needed refuge

00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.564
to many, many people
in desperate circumstances

00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:37.819
ever since.

00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:42.484
Now, it was the courage
and verve of radical designers

00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:44.360
like Bucky and Moholy

00:07:44.384 --> 00:07:46.657
that drew me to design.

00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:50.717
I began my career as a news journalist
and foreign correspondent.

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.159
I wrote about politics, economics
and corporate affairs,

00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:58.009
and I could have chosen
to specialize in any of those fields.

00:07:58.033 --> 00:07:59.777
But I picked design,

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:03.509
because I believe it's one of the most
powerful tools at our disposal

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.952
to improve our quality of life.

00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:10.333
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.021
(Applause)

00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:16.453
And greatly as I admire the achievements
of professional designers,

00:08:16.477 --> 00:08:19.072
which have been extraordinary and immense,

00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:20.557
I also believe

00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:24.074
that design benefits hugely
from the originality,

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:25.416
the lateral thinking

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.155
and the resourcefulness
of its rebels and renegades.

00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:33.629
And we're living at a remarkable
moment in design,

00:08:33.653 --> 00:08:38.457
because this is a time when the two camps
are coming closer together.

00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.772
Because even very basic advances
in digital technology

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:47.080
have enabled them to operate
increasingly independently,

00:08:47.104 --> 00:08:49.518
in or out of a commercial context,

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:54.591
to pursue ever more ambitious
and eclectic objectives.

00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.261
So in theory,

00:08:56.285 --> 00:09:01.572
basic platforms like crowdfunding,
cloud computing, social media

00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:05.040
are giving greater freedom
to professional designers

00:09:05.064 --> 00:09:08.549
and giving more resources
for the improvisational ones,

00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:09.730
and hopefully,

00:09:09.754 --> 00:09:12.259
a more receptive response to their ideas.

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:16.838
Now, some of my favorite
examples of this are in Africa,

00:09:16.862 --> 00:09:18.989
where a new generation of designers

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:22.558
are developing incredible
Internet of Things technologies

00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:27.186
to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream
of improving healthcare

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.758
in countries where more people
now have access to cell phones

00:09:30.782 --> 00:09:32.967
than to clean, running water.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.618
And among them is Arthur Zang.

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.512
He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:42.681
who has a adapted a tablet
computer into the Cardiopad,

00:09:42.705 --> 00:09:45.128
a mobile heart-monitoring device.

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:49.493
It can be used to monitor the hearts
of patients in remote, rural areas.

00:09:49.517 --> 00:09:52.163
The data is then sent
on a cellular network

00:09:52.187 --> 00:09:55.217
to well-equipped hospitals
hundreds of miles away

00:09:55.241 --> 00:09:56.417
for analysis.

00:09:56.441 --> 00:09:59.746
And if any problems are spotted
by the specialists there,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.994
a suitable course of treatment
is recommended.

00:10:03.018 --> 00:10:05.329
And this of course saves many patients

00:10:05.353 --> 00:10:10.558
from making long, arduous, expensive
and often pointless journeys

00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:11.900
to those hospitals,

00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:14.203
and makes it much, much likelier

00:10:14.227 --> 00:10:16.828
that their hearts
will actually be checked.

00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:20.620
Arthur Zang started working
on the Cardiopad eight years ago,

00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:23.367
in his final year at university.

00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:26.806
But he failed to persuade
any conventional sources

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.257
to give him investment to get
the project off the ground.

00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:32.154
He posted the idea on Facebook,

00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:34.834
where a Cameroonian
government official saw it

00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:37.811
and managed to secure
a government grant for him.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:41.155
He's now developing
not only the Cardiopad,

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:45.807
but other mobile medical devices
to treat different conditions.

00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:47.477
And he isn't alone,

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:52.424
because there are many other
inspiring and enterprising designers

00:10:52.448 --> 00:10:56.340
who are also pursuing
extraordinary projects of their own.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.910
And I'm going to finish
by looking at just a few of them.

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:02.189
One is Peek Vision.

00:11:02.213 --> 00:11:05.288
This is a group of doctors
and designers in Kenya,

00:11:05.312 --> 00:11:08.521
who've developed an Internet of Things
technology of their own,

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:11.146
as a portable eye examination kit.

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.561
Then there's Gabriel Maher,

00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:15.659
who is developing a new design language

00:11:15.683 --> 00:11:20.803
to enable us to articulate the subtleties
of our changing gender identities,

00:11:20.827 --> 00:11:23.712
without recourse
to traditional stereotypes.

00:11:23.736 --> 00:11:28.003
All of these designers and many more
are pursuing their dreams,

00:11:28.027 --> 00:11:30.653
by the making the most
of their newfound freedom,

00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:33.575
with the discipline
of professional designers

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:36.501
and the resourcefulness
of rebels and renegades.

00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:38.587
And we all stand to benefit.

00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:39.774
Thank you.

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:43.317
(Applause)
