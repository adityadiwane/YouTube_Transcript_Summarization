00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
When I was little --

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
and by the way, I was little once --

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
my father told me a story

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
about an 18th century watchmaker.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And what this guy had done:

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
And one day, one of his customers came into his workshop

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And the guy took it apart,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And as he did so, his customer noticed

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
were words.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And he said to the guy,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
"Why have you put stuff on the back

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that no one will ever see?"

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
And the watchmaker turned around and said,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
"God can see it."

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Now I'm not in the least bit religious,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
neither was my father,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
but at that point, I noticed something happening here.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
I felt something

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
But I felt something.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
And it was a physiological response.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
And from that point on, from my age at the time,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I began to think of things in a different way.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And as I took on my career as a designer,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I began to ask myself the simple question:

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Do we actually think beauty,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
or do we feel it?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Now you probably know the answer to this already.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
but I think it's about feeling beauty.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And so I then moved on into my design career

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
and began to find some exciting things.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
One of the most early work was done in automotive design --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
some very exciting work was done there.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
And during a lot of this work,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
we found something, or I found something,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
click click, when you closed the door in a car?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And then somebody, I think it was BMW,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
introduced a light that went out slowly.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Remember that?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I remember it clearly.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
In fact, I've never found anybody

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I thought, well what the hell's that about?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
So I started to ask myself questions about it.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
or, "It's nice."

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I thought, well that's not good enough.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Can we cut down a little bit further,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
of how this actually works.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And so I did some experiments.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And I suddenly realized

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
that there was something that did exactly that --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
light to dark in six seconds --

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
exactly that.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Do you know what it is? Anyone?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
the slow bit of the brain -- using that.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And this isn't a think, it's a feel.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And would you do me a favor?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
will you feel stuff?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
I felt a sense of relaxation

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
tempered with anticipation.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And that thing that I found

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
was the cinema or the theater.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
It's actually just happened here --

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
light to dark in six seconds.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And when that happens, are you sitting there going,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
"No, the movie's about to start,"

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
or are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
I get a sense of anticipation"?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
Now I'm not a neuroscientist.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
But it might be.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
that used to go in the cinema get this.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And some of the people I speak to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
that have never seen a movie or been to the theater

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
don't get it in the same way.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
Everybody likes it,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
but some like it more than others.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
So this leads me to think of this in a different way.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system --

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
if that's not an outmoded idea.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
These are the bits, the pleasure centers,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
is bypassing my thinking.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
They arrive first.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So how do we make that actually work?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And how much of that reactive side of it

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
is due to what we already know,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
or what we're going to learn, about something?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
This is one of the most beautiful things I know.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
It's a plastic bag.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Then I found out,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
post exposure,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
or a stream filled with coliforms

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
and all sorts of disgusting stuff,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
that that filthy water

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
And all of a sudden, this plastic bag

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
was extremely beautiful to me.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
Now I'm going to ask you again

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
to switch on the emotional bit.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Would you mind taking the brain out,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
and I just want you to feel something.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Look at that. What are you feeling about it?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
I'm watching your faces very carefully.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and some slightly engaged-looking ladies

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
who are picking up something off that.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Maybe there's an innocence to it.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This is the last act on this Earth

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
of a little girl called Heidi, five years old,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
before she died of cancer to the spine.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
It's the last thing she did,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the last physical act.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Look at that picture.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Is it beautiful now?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
Stop. Stop. How do you feel?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
Where are you feeling this?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And I'm watching your faces,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
because your faces are telling me something.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But what are you doing?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
I watch what people do.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I watch faces.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
I watch reactions.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
Because I have to know how people react to things.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And one of the most common faces

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
on something faced with beauty,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
something stupefyingly delicious,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
is what I call the OMG.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
It's not a "this is wonderful!"

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and the mouth is hanging open.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
That's not the expression of joy.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
There's something else in that.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
There's something weird happening.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
So pleasure seems to be tempered

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
by a whole series of different things coming in.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
It means something triggering a big emotional response,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.260
often quite a sad emotional response,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
but it's part of what we do.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
It isn't just about nice.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things --

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.260
mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to come up with that sensorial exposure,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that sensation of what's going on.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
Pathos appears obviously

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And that's packed in there as well.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And as we assemble these tools,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
because these are things, as we've already said,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
they're arriving at the brain, it would seem,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
before cognition, before we can manipulate them --

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
electrochemical party tricks.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Now what I'm also interested in is:

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Is it possible to separate

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
intrinsic and extrinsic beauty?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
just something that's exquisitely beautiful,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
that's universally beautiful.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Very hard to find something that, to everybody,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
is a very beautiful thing,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.260
without a certain amount of information packed in there before.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.260
It's mediated by information before the comprehension.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Or the information's added on at the back,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
Now when talking about beauty

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
you can't get away from the fact

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
that a lot experiments have been done in this way

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
with faces and what have you.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
And one of the most tedious ones, I think,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
was saying that beauty was about symmetry.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Well it obviously isn't.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
This is a more interesting one

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
where half faces were shown to some people,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and then to add them into a list

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
of most beautiful to least beautiful

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and then exposing a full face.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So it wasn't about symmetry.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
of which both sides are beautiful.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But they're both different.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and tried to understand what the individual elements were,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
but feeling it as I go.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
if I look at that eye.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
So I don't know how much this is helping me,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
but it's helping to guide me to the places

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
where the signals are coming off.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
but to understand how I can start to assemble things

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
that will very quickly bypass

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
this thinking part

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
that we see things not as they are, but as we are.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
which is beautiful to me.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And this is the F1 MV Agusta.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Ahhhh.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
how exquisite this object is.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
But I also know why it's exquisite to me,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
because it's a palimpsest of things.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
It's masses and masses of layers.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
It's something much bigger.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
I mean, if I just go through some of them now --

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
So that's getting me excited.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
And I feel that here.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
This bit, the big secret of automotive design --

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
reflection management.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
It's not about the shapes,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
it's how the shapes reflect light.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
so it becomes a kinetic object,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
even though it's standing still --

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
means there's something going on underneath it --

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
taking the power from the engine.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
I'm getting terribly excited

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
as my mind and my eyes flick across these things.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
Titanium lacquer on this.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I'm really getting into this now.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
but this one, because it's a road bike,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
So it disappears.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Why would you do that?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And to cap it all,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
brand royalty --

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Agusta, Count Agusta,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
from the great histories of this stuff.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Massimo Tamburini.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
as well as "Maestro,"

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
because he actually is engineer

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
We have to deal with it.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
So I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
and I've got to work with everything else all the time,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and so compromises start to fit into it.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And so look at her.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
No one's noticed, have they yet?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
Did you see what I did?

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
I moved three things by a millimeter.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Pretty? Yes.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.260
But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
So that's okay, isn't it?

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
Another millimeter?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
No one's going to notice those split lines and changes.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
It's that easy to lose beauty,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.260
because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And only a few people can do it.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And a focus group cannot do it.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And a team rarely can do it.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
It takes a central cortex, if you like,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
This is a beautiful water bottle --

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
some of you know of it --

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
as long as you know what water is like

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
then you can experience this.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
It's lovely because it is an embodiment

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
of something refreshing and delicious.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
I might like it more than you like it,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
It's stupefyingly difficult

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
to make something that refracts light like that,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
that comes out of the tool correctly,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
that goes down the line without falling over.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Underneath this, like the story of the swan,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
is a million things very difficult to do.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
So all hail to that.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
It's a fantastic example, a simple object.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And they're working in beauty

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
in slightly different ways because of it.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
You all, I guess, like me,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
when they come out of the points?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
something horrible's going on down here.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
The comprehension of it

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
leads us to a greater and heightened sense

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
of the beauty of what's actually going on.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
so please ignore me.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
But what I have to do now, feeling again,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
of these triggers into something early on in the process,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
that you pick it up,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
not through your thinking, but through your feeling.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
So we're going to have a little experiment.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
Right, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
Are you ready? Okay.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
It's not.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
That blip, that information, shot into you before that.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
And because your brain starter motor began there,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
now it's got to deal with it.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.260
And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
specifically to engender a sense

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
that it's green technology and it's good for you

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and it's light and it's all part of the future.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
So is that wrong?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Well in this case it isn't,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
But you're a slave of that first flash.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.260
We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second --

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and that's where much of my work

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
has to win or lose,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
on a shelf in a shop.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
It wins or loses at that point.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
as you walk down it,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
but I have to work within that domain,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
to ensure that it gets you there first.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Some of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
What's incredible about this,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
and the way I love to come back to it,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
is this is taking something that you hate or bores you,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
folding clothes,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
and if you can actually do this --

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
who can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Yeah?

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
It's fantastic, isn't it?

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
Look at that. Do you want to see it again?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
But just go to the Web, YouTube,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
pull it down, "folding T-shirt."

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
You didn't maybe know it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
But how do you feel about it?

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have --

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
you look really smart.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
the stuff that costs nothing,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
because that knowledge is free --

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
bundle that together and where do we come out?

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
Form follows function?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
Form is function. Form is function.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
It informs, it tells us,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
And so I've stopped using words like "form,"

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
What I try to pursue now

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
is the emotional functionality of things.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.260
Because if I can get that right,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
And you know what those products and services are,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
because you own some of them.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
Forming the emotional bond

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
between this thing and you

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
is an electrochemical party trick

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260
that happens before you even think about it.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.260
(Applause)
