00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Dogs have interests.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.160
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
It's a difficult choice, right?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Rear end, owner. Rear end wins.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
I mean, you lose.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
You cannot compete with the environment,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160
if you have an adolescent dog's brain.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
the dog's point of view.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
Now, I'm here largely because

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160
number one, by making up rules, human rules.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
We don't take the dog's point of view into account.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
And then number three, now we can punish the dog

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.160
So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
you know, isn't that nice?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.160
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So, this whole dominance issue -- number one,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
of a very complicated social system.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And they take this stuff seriously.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
because it prevents physical fights.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
The number one is, "I have it, you don't."

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Dogs get so abused.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Dogs, horses and humans --

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
these are the three species which are so abused in life.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
And the reason is built into their behavior --

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
is to always come back and apologize.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
They are just so beatable,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
and that's why they get beaten.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.160
stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160
hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
Because he grew?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
This is insanity.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.160
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
I said, "Let's teach him to sit."

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.160
And then we give him a reason for sitting.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
Because the first stage

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
is basically teaching a dog ESL.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.160
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
Go on, something should happen now.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Well, I've got news for you.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
English as a second language.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160
And that's how we use the food lure in the hand,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
and we use food because we're dealing with owners.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160
much better than I am.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I don't need food, but the average owner says,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
"Puppy, sit."

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.160
like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
You know, "Sit, sit."

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Then we phase out the food as a lure,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160
and you can actually communicate to a dog

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
in a perfectly constructed English sentence.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
and the name of my son, "Jamie."

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
And the dog can take a note,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
and take him a little message that says,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.160
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.160
Will it do it?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Not necessarily, no.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160
why come to the owner?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.160
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
We use the Premack principle.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160
one the dog doesn't want to do --

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160
by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.160
look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.160
"Sit," sniff butt.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160
So now all of these distractions that worked against training

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
now become rewards that work for training.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160
And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
And I can imagine this dog, you know,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160
They're like Golden Retrievers.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.160
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
they will throw tennis balls,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
they will cook for me and serve the food.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Then I have my own personal doorman,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.160
And now the dog's really happy.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And this, to me, is always what training is.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
So we really motivate the dog to want to do it,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Now we move to phase three, when now --

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
there's times, you know, when daddy knows best.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
And there's times, for example,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
if my son's friends leave the door open,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.160
the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
This is a life-or-death thing.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.160
You leave this, the sanctity of your house,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
and you could be hit on the street.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160
So some things we have to let the dog know,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160
"You mustn't do this."

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And so we have to enforce, but without force.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
They think a punishment is something nasty.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160
I bet a lot of you do, right?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.160
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
It doesn't have to be.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160
There's several definitions of what a punishment is,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
but one definition, the most popular, is:

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.160
a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
such that it's less likely to occur in the future.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.160
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.160
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
and they never took it outside.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160
The dog is actually euthanized now,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160
but this was a dog I worked with for a while.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.160
so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160
we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160
And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
When the dog would try to leave the mat,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160
she would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.160
The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
because we had a lot of aggression related towards food.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.160
The breaks got fewer and fewer.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160
You see, the punishment was working.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
The behavior problem was going away.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
She never raised her voice.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.160
If she did, she would have got bitten.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
It's not a good dog you shout at.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160
grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.160
Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
This is crazy.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
So, where do we go from here?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
We want a better way.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Dogs deserve better.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.160
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.160
It has to do with watching people train puppies,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.160
and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
horrendous relationship skills.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.160
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.160
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160
You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160
and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.160
The dog says, "I don't think so."

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160
(Laughter)

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
I mean, who in their right mind

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
would think that a dog would want to approach them

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
when they're screaming like that?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
Instead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
I was walking onto a plane --

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.160
this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
and it really cemented what I wanted to do

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
with this whole puppy-training thing,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
You know, I puppy-train my child.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160
and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
kicking the back of the chair.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
"Johnny, don't do that."

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160
Kick, kick, kick.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.160
I'm standing right here with my bag.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
And ugly face is this --

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.160
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
That child has lost everything --

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
that one of the two people he can trust in this world

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160
has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
I walked to the back of the plane,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.160
I sat down, and a thought came to me.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160
If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160
(Laughter)

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.160
If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160
He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.160
And this is what it's all about.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
These relationship skills are so easy.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.160
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
You know, kind of like a little robot.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160
And then, a little behavior problem comes up.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160
No different from the dog barking.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.160
The husband won't clear up his clothes,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160
or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160
And it then starts, and we get into this thing,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.160
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
especially with children, especially with parents.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160
You see it especially in the workplace,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.160
especially from boss to employee.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160
It's as if there's some schadenfreude there,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160
that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.160
so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160
It really is.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.160
We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160
And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.160
You know, calculus is wonderful.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.160
When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.160
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics --

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
these are cool things.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
And my look to the future is,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.160
that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.160
Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Your kids are easy to train.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160
All you've got to do is to watch them,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.160
to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
That is such a powerful training technique.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
This should be taught in schools.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160
Relationships -- how do you negotiate?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
How on earth about raising children?

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160
which are just as hard to break as bad habits.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
So, that would be my wish to the future.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160
Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.160
but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two --

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160
(Applause)
