00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:17.001
In 2012, when I painted
the minaret of Jara Mosque

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.956
in my hometown of Gabés,
in the south of Tunisia,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.247
I never thought that graffiti would bring
so much attention to a city.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:29.197
At the beginning, I was just looking
for a wall in my hometown,

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.451
and it happened that the minaret
was built in '94.

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:37.719
And for 18 years, those 57 meters
of concrete stayed grey.

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:42.218
When I met the imam for the first time,
and I told him what I wanted to do,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.686
he was like, "Thank God you finally came,"

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.517
and he told me that for years
he was waiting for somebody

00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:48.834
to do something on it.

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:53.508
The most amazing thing about this imam
is that he didn't ask me anything --

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:56.942
neither a sketch,
or what I was going to write.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.832
In every work that I create,
I write messages

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:04.979
with my style of calligraffiti --
a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:07.494
I use quotes or poetry.

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.860
For the minaret, I thought that
the most relevant message

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.500
to be put on a mosque
should come from the Quran,

00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:15.135
so I picked this verse:

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.399
"Oh humankind, we have created you
from a male and a female,

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.838
and made you people and tribe,
so you may know each other."

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:25.179
It was a universal call for peace,
tolerance, and acceptance

00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:29.172
coming from the side that we don't usually
portray in a good way in the media.

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:33.429
I was amazed to see how the local
community reacted to the painting,

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.760
and how it made them proud to see
the minaret getting so much attention

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:40.489
from international press
all around the world.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.514
For the imam, it was not
just the painting;

00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:45.403
it was really deeper than that.

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:48.864
He hoped that this minaret would become
a monument for the city,

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:51.759
and attract people
to this forgotten place of Tunisia.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.909
The universality of the message,

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.179
the political context
of Tunisia at this time,

00:01:57.203 --> 00:02:00.687
and the fact that I was writing
Quran in a graffiti way

00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:02.353
were not insignificant.

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.431
It reunited the community.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.573
Bringing people, future generations,

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:11.573
together through Arabic calligraphy

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:13.058
is what I do.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:16.087
Writing messages is
the essence of my artwork.

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:20.047
What is funny, actually, is that
even Arabic-speaking people

00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:23.906
really need to focus a lot
to decipher what I'm writing.

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:27.605
You don't need to know
the meaning to feel the piece.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:31.733
I think that Arabic script touches
your soul before it reaches your eyes.

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:34.827
There is a beauty in it
that you don't need to translate.

00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:37.906
Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.447
to you, to you, to you, to anybody,

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.431
and then when you get the meaning,

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.435
you feel connected to it.

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:47.782
I always make sure to write messages

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:50.177
that are relevant to the place
where I'm painting,

00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:53.282
but messages that have
a universal dimension,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.048
so anybody around the world
can connect to it.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.026
I was born and raised in France, in Paris,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.995
and I started learning how to write
and read Arabic when I was 18.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.060
Today I only write messages in Arabic.

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:10.281
One of the reasons
this is so important to me,

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:14.121
is because of all the reaction that
I've experienced all around the world.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.606
In Rio de Janeiro, I translated
this Portuguese poem

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.542
from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:24.946
who was giving an homage
to the poor people of the favela,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.938
and then I painted it on the rooftop.

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.280
The local community were really
intrigued by what I was doing,

00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:33.897
but as soon as I gave them
the meaning of the calligraphy,

00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:36.850
they thanked me, as they felt
connected to the piece.

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:40.713
In South Africa, in Cape Town,

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:43.786
the local community of Philippi

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.857
offered me the only
concrete wall of the slum.

00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.254
It was a school, and I wrote on it

00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:50.746
a quote from Nelson Mandela,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.433
saying, "[in Arabic],"

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:56.140
which means, "It seems
impossible until it's done."

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.074
Then this guy came to me and said,
"Man, why you don't write in English?"

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:04.193
and I replied to him, "I would consider
your concern legit if you asked me

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:05.801
why I didn't write in Zulu."

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.056
In Paris, once, there was this event,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.986
and someone gave his wall to be painted.

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:16.373
And when he saw I was painting in Arabic,

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:20.421
he got so mad -- actually, hysterical --
and he asked for the wall to be erased.

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:22.412
I was mad and disappointed.

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:26.313
But a week later, the organizer
of the event asked me to come back,

00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:30.055
and he told me that there was a wall
right in front of this guy's house.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.231
So, this guy --

00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:33.474
(Laughter)

00:04:33.498 --> 00:04:35.523
like, was forced to see it every day.

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:38.531
At the beginning, I was going
to write, "[In Arabic],"

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:40.546
which means, "In your face," but --

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.913
(Laughter)

00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:46.596
I decided to be smarter
and I wrote, "[In Arabic],"

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.254
which means, "Open your heart."

00:04:49.095 --> 00:04:52.171
I'm really proud of my culture,

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:57.710
and I'm trying to be an ambassador
of it through my artwork.

00:04:57.734 --> 00:05:02.670
And I hope that I can break
the stereotypes we all know,

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:04.468
with the beauty of Arabic script.

00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:10.655
Today, I don't write the translation
of the message anymore on the wall.

00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:14.825
I don't want the poetry
of the calligraphy to be broken,

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.030
as it's art and you can appreciate it
without knowing the meaning,

00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:21.090
as you can enjoy any music
from other countries.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.405
Some people see that
as a rejection or a closed door,

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.898
but for me, it's more an invitation --

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:31.201
to my language,
to my culture, and to my art.

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:32.383
Thank you.

00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:35.259
(Applause)
