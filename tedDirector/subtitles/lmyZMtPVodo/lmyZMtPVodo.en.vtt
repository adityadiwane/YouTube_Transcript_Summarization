00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.240
There's a man by the name of Captain

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.570
William Swenson

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.772
who recently was awarded the
congressional Medal of Honor

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:25.630
for his actions on September 8, 2009.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.995
On that day, a column of American

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.279
and Afghan troops

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.756
were making their way

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:33.640
through a part of Afghanistan

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.913
to help protect

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:38.008
a group of government officials,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:39.854
a group of Afghan government officials,

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.220
who would be meeting with some local

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.723
village elders.

00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:45.990
The column came under ambush,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.497
and was surrounded on three sides,

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:51.437
and amongst many other things,

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:52.843
Captain Swenson was recognized

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:55.060
for running into live fire

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.241
to rescue the wounded

00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:00.464
and pull out the dead.

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:03.320
One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.758
and he and a comrade were making their way

00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.048
to a medevac helicopter.

00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:10.236
And what was remarkable about this day

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.227
is, by sheer coincidence,

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:13.907
one of the medevac medics

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.295
happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:21.057
and captured the whole scene on camera.

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:24.263
It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:25.489
bringing this wounded soldier

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:30.039
who had received a gunshot to the neck.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.532
They put him in the helicopter,

00:01:33.532 --> 00:01:37.860
and then you see Captain Swenson bend over

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.043
and give him a kiss

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:44.881
before he turns around to rescue more.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.088
I saw this, and I thought to myself,

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:50.860
where do people like that come from?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.903
What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:55.604
when you would want to do that.

00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:57.644
There's a love there,

00:01:57.644 --> 00:01:59.778
and I wanted to know why is it that

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:02.462
I don't have people that I work with like that?

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.880
You know, in the military, they give medals

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.502
to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.340
so that others may gain.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.268
In business, we give bonuses to people

00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:11.976
who are willing to sacrifice others

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:13.470
so that we may gain.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.134
We have it backwards. Right?

00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:19.013
So I asked myself, where do
people like this come from?

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:22.236
And my initial conclusion was
that they're just better people.

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:23.756
That's why they're attracted to the military.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:25.217
These better people are attracted

00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:27.963
to this concept of service.

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:29.063
But that's completely wrong.

00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:31.900
What I learned was that it's the environment,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.070
and if you get the environment right,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.793
every single one of us has the capacity

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:37.311
to do these remarkable things,

00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:40.142
and more importantly, others have that capacity too.

00:02:40.142 --> 00:02:42.587
I've had the great honor of getting to meet

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:45.702
some of these, who we would call heroes,

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:47.604
who have put themselves and put their lives

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.203
at risk to save others,

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.706
and I asked them, "Why would you do it?

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.759
Why did you do it?"

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.660
And they all say the same thing:

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.760
"Because they would have done it for me."

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.667
It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.266
So trust and cooperation are really important here.

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.425
The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.730
is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.765
I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:16.000
I can't simply instruct two people 
to cooperate, and they will.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.434
It's not how it works. It's a feeling.

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:20.848
So where does that feeling come from?

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.930
If you go back 50,000 years

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.109
to the Paleolithic era,

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.265
to the early days of Homo sapiens,

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:27.880
what we find is that the world

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.215
was filled with danger,

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:34.607
all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:36.106
Nothing personal.

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:38.548
Whether it was the weather,

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.188
lack of resources,

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:41.670
maybe a saber-toothed tiger,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.005
all of these things working

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.141
to reduce our lifespan.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.442
And so we evolved into social animals,

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:49.417
where we lived together and worked together

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.841
in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,

00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.864
where we felt like we belonged.

00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:57.595
And when we felt safe amongst our own,

00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:00.803
the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:01.905
There are inherent benefits to this.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.793
It means I can fall asleep at night

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:07.665
and trust that someone from within
my tribe will watch for danger.

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:09.997
If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,

00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:11.381
that means you won't watch for danger.

00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.252
Bad system of survival.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.591
The modern day is exactly the same thing.

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:17.212
The world is filled with danger,

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:18.967
things that are trying to frustrate our lives

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.136
or reduce our success,

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.860
reduce our opportunity for success.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.229
It could be the ups and downs in the economy,

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.569
the uncertainty of the stock market.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.313
It could be a new technology that renders

00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:30.470
your business model obsolete overnight.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.119
Or it could be your competition

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.119
that is sometimes trying to kill you.

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:36.004
It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.715
but at the very minimum

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:40.378
is working hard to frustrate your growth

00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:42.508
and steal your business from you.

00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:44.253
We have no control over these forces.

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:45.770
These are a constant,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.748
and they're not going away.

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:49.794
The only variable are the conditions

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:52.357
inside the organization,

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:54.282
and that's where leadership matters,

00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:56.961
because it's the leader that sets the tone.

00:04:56.961 --> 00:04:59.400
When a leader makes the choice

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.929
to put the safety and lives

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:03.190
of the people inside the organization first,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.068
to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice

00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:09.573
the tangible results, so that the people remain

00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:11.000
and feel safe and feel like they belong,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.894
remarkable things happen.

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:17.013
I was flying on a trip,

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:19.128
and I was witness to an incident

00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:21.016
where a passenger attempted to board

00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:24.627
before their number was called,

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:27.196
and I watched the gate agent

00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:29.620
treat this man like he had broken the law,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.029
like a criminal.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.875
He was yelled at for attempting to board

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.246
one group too soon.

00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:36.690
So I said something.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.360
I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.451
Why can't you treat us like human beings?"

00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:44.572
And this is exactly what she said to me.

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.258
She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,

00:05:47.258 --> 00:05:50.408
I could get in trouble or lose my job."

00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:51.990
All she was telling me

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.646
is that she doesn't feel safe.

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:55.987
All she was telling me is that

00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:59.206
she doesn't trust her leaders.

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:01.928
The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:04.395
is not because they necessarily hire better people.

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:07.434
It's because they don't fear their leaders.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.356
You see, if the conditions are wrong,

00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:11.615
we are forced to expend our own time and energy

00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:14.479
to protect ourselves from each other,

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.778
and that inherently weakens the organization.

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:19.409
When we feel safe inside the organization,

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.603
we will naturally combine our talents

00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:23.749
and our strengths and work tirelessly

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.431
to face the dangers outside

00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:28.566
and seize the opportunities.

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:29.887
The closest analogy I can give

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:33.099
to what a great leader is, is like being a parent.

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.758
If you think about what being a great parent is,

00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:36.588
what do you want? What makes a great parent?

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:37.940
We want to give our child opportunities,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.658
education, discipline them when necessary,

00:06:40.658 --> 00:06:42.694
all so that they can grow up and achieve more

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.259
than we could for ourselves.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.000
Great leaders want exactly the same thing.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.501
They want to provide their people opportunity,

00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:50.288
education, discipline when necessary,

00:06:50.288 --> 00:06:53.450
build their self-confidence, give
them the opportunity to try and fail,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.161
all so that they could achieve more

00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:59.591
than we could ever imagine for ourselves.

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:02.728
Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of
a company called Next Jump

00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:05.478
in New York City, a tech company,

00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:06.970
he makes the point that

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.099
if you had hard times in your family,

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.148
would you ever consider laying
off one of your children?

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:13.650
We would never do it.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.677
Then why do we consider laying off people

00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:17.254
inside our organization?

00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:20.054
Charlie implemented a policy

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.990
of lifetime employment.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.620
If you get a job at Next Jump,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.080
you cannot get fired for performance issues.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.063
In fact, if you have issues,

00:07:29.063 --> 00:07:32.110
they will coach you and they will give you support,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.571
just like we would with one of our children

00:07:33.571 --> 00:07:36.410
who happens to come home with a C from school.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.363
It's the complete opposite.

00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:38.980
This is the reason so many people

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.244
have such a visceral hatred, anger,

00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:44.912
at some of these banking CEOs

00:07:44.912 --> 00:07:47.740
with their disproportionate
salaries and bonus structures.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.710
It's not the numbers.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.548
It's that they have violated the
very definition of leadership.

00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:55.442
They have violated this deep-seated social contract.

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:57.045
We know that they allowed their people

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.560
to be sacrificed so they could
protect their own interests,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.752
or worse, they sacrificed their people

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:04.212
to protect their own interests.

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:07.023
This is what so offends us, not the numbers.

00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:08.620
Would anybody be offended if we gave

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.193
a $150 million bonus to Gandhi?

00:08:11.193 --> 00:08:14.232
How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?

00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:16.966
Do we have an issue with that? None at all.

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:18.298
None at all.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.509
Great leaders would never sacrifice

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:21.870
the people to save the numbers.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.549
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers

00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:26.528
to save the people.

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:28.651
Bob Chapman, who runs

00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:30.964
a large manufacturing company in the Midwest

00:08:30.964 --> 00:08:33.040
called Barry-Wehmiller,

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.397
in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,

00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:42.398
and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.

00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:43.784
Now in a large manufacturing company,

00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:45.325
this is a big deal,

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:48.172
and they could no longer afford their labor pool.

00:08:48.172 --> 00:08:49.875
They needed to save 10 million dollars,

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.898
so, like so many companies today,

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:55.292
the board got together and discussed layoffs.

00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:56.916
And Bob refused.

00:08:56.916 --> 00:09:01.168
You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:04.609
Bob believes in heart counts,

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:07.117
and it's much more difficult to simply reduce

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:08.847
the heart count.

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.854
And so they came up with a furlough program.

00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:13.945
Every employee, from secretary to CEO,

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:17.411
was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.

00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:19.322
They could take it any time they wanted,

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:22.303
and they did not have to take it consecutively.

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:23.635
But it was how Bob announced the program

00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:25.532
that mattered so much.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:28.180
He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.965
than any of us should have to suffer a lot,

00:09:30.965 --> 00:09:34.083
and morale went up.

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:37.010
They saved 20 million dollars,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.447
and most importantly, as would be expected,

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:42.676
when the people feel safe and protected
by the leadership in the organization,

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:45.183
the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:47.940
And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.856
people started trading with each other.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.352
Those who could afford it more

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:53.429
would trade with those who could afford it less.

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:54.918
People would take five weeks

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:59.080
so that somebody else only had to take three.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.014
Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.

00:10:02.014 --> 00:10:03.722
I know many people at the seniormost

00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:04.880
levels of organizations

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.484
who are absolutely not leaders.

00:10:06.484 --> 00:10:09.037
They are authorities, and we do what they say

00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:12.080
because they have authority over us,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.940
but we would not follow them.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.974
And I know many people

00:10:15.974 --> 00:10:17.336
who are at the bottoms of organizations

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:18.599
who have no authority

00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:20.662
and they are absolutely leaders,

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.447
and this is because they have chosen to look after

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:23.965
the person to the left of them,

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:25.243
and they have chosen to look after

00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:27.037
the person to the right of them.

00:10:27.037 --> 00:10:31.770
This is what a leader is.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.800
I heard a story

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.390
of some Marines

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.711
who were out in theater,

00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:41.757
and as is the Marine custom,

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.082
the officer ate last,

00:10:44.082 --> 00:10:47.258
and he let his men eat first,

00:10:47.258 --> 00:10:49.110
and when they were done,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.200
there was no food left for him.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.933
And when they went back out in the field,

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:58.877
his men brought him some of their food

00:10:58.877 --> 00:11:00.734
so that he may eat,

00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:02.873
because that's what happens.

00:11:02.873 --> 00:11:05.562
We call them leaders because they go first.

00:11:05.562 --> 00:11:07.305
We call them leaders because they take the risk

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:08.960
before anybody else does.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.990
We call them leaders because they will choose

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.999
to sacrifice so that their people

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:14.118
may be safe and protected

00:11:14.118 --> 00:11:16.254
and so their people may gain,

00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:19.308
and when we do, the natural response

00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:23.155
is that our people will sacrifice for us.

00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:25.653
They will give us their blood and sweat and tears

00:11:25.653 --> 00:11:29.092
to see that their leader's vision comes to life,

00:11:29.092 --> 00:11:31.864
and when we ask them, "Why would you do that?

00:11:31.864 --> 00:11:34.251
Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears

00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:38.735
for that person?" they all say the same thing:

00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:41.233
"Because they would have done it for me."

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.383
And isn't that the organization

00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:45.704
we would all like to work in?

00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:48.261
Thank you very much.

00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:51.862
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:51.862 --> 00:11:53.892
Thank you. (Applause)
