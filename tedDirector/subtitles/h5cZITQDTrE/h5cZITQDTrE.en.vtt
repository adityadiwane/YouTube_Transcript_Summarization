00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
an ancient work from ancient India

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
All the young people, actually, from the city.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because when he came to their city he accepted --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"He's supposed to be religious and all this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They wouldn't go listen to him.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But the young people all came.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And as soon as they had laid all these,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
with human life on it,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or rocks or flames or gases exploding.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They actually see landscapes and human beings

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He made that special effect at the beginning

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to get everyone to think about interconnection

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and how we're all totally interconnected here,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if that's a modern form of enlightenment.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of where everybody can really know everything

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's going on everywhere in the planet.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And therefore it will become intolerable --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the life of the mind or whatever it is,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It just becomes intolerable.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
a little bit tired, we do suffer.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but basically we all have this common misery

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that we are sort of stuck inside our skins

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and everyone else is out there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
is that all we are is what is inside our skin.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And it's inside and outside, self and other,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and other is all very different.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
a little bit, right?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you'd freak out.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What do they want from me? Like, who's that?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and everyone else is different,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Who's going to get enough out of the world?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
if you're different from all the other beings?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So where compassion comes is where you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
knowing that you have no such boundary,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
You can experience yourself as the other beings

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It would be terrible.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
When you're no longer locked in yourself,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and realizing that you are the other being,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
like the Beatles used to sing.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and they've been trying to suppress it since then.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But when we're relieved from that,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's totally strange.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The Dalai Lama always likes to say --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Like, even when you're having a good time,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
when is the good time over?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The good time is over when you think, how good is it?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And then it's never good enough.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
doing it by having a good time.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
they went and took everything away from the haves.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They took it all away by violence,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
They didn't help at all.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And so then he looks at me.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
was all I could think of. What is virtue?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
is that it is more fun.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Even though his people are being genocided --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
in every Chinese prison. He feels it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Because when you open up like that,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
how it can be changed.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
She scared us with the lava man is coming,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
then the tsunami is coming,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It's really lovely.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and the human being actually is compassion.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
The human being is almost out of time.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And he would have tremendous fun doing that.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So the first person who gets happy,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
where you're always dissatisfied --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm going to get up in the morning and think,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
my pet, my butterfly?"

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And the first person who gets happy when you do that,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
because your whole perception broadens

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And you realize that this -- being with these people --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It is Nirvana.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Thank you.
