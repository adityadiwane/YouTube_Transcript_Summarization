00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.041
I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.096
and you may think that sculptors,

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:27.385
well, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:30.343
they deal with bodies,

00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:34.886
but I think, really, what I care about most

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:38.934
is making space, and that's what I've called this talk:

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.541
Making Space.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.949
Space that exists within us,

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.018
and without us.

00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:52.187
So, when I was a child,

00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:54.198
I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:59.610
but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.957
It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,

00:01:02.957 --> 00:01:06.037
you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:07.926
But I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:09.701
that was actually made out of an old balcony,

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:14.856
so it was incredibly hot, small and light,

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.271
and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.879
But anyway, for some reason, I promised myself

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.132
that I wasn't going to move,

00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:25.069
that I was going to do this thing that Mummy

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.996
wanted me to do.

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:30.669
And there I was, lying there in this tiny space,

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:37.059
hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:41.124
but it was really weird, like, after this went on

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:47.837
for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:51.501
and darker and cooler

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:56.371
until I really looked forward to that half an hour

00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:00.478
of enforced immobility and rest,

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:05.132
and I really looked forward to going to that place

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:07.694
of darkness.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.150
Do you mind if we do something completely different?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.186
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:13.834
Now, this isn't going to be freaky.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.456
It isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)

00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:18.704
It's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.852
So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:24.687
So close your eyes for a minute.

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:27.797
Here we are, in a space,

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:35.269
the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.324
I think of this as the place of imagination,

00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:42.624
of potential,

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:45.524
but what are its qualities?

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:50.821
It is objectless. There are no things in it.

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:56.772
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.

00:02:56.772 --> 00:03:01.362
It is endless.

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.908
Okay, open your eyes.

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:08.117
That's the space that I think sculpture --

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:11.185
which is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:14.529
making material propositions --

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.650
but I think that's the space

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.318
that sculpture can connect us with.

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:25.503
So, imagine we're in the middle of America.

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:28.375
You're asleep. You wake up,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.722
and without lifting your head from the earth

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:37.160
on your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.411
This is a dry lake bed.

00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:44.653
I was young. I'd just finished art school.

00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:46.825
I wanted to do something that was working

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:51.977
directly with the world, directly with place.

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:55.040
This was a wonderful place, because it was a place

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.257
where you could imagine that you were the

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:59.591
first person to be there.

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.500
It was a place where nothing very much had happened.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.745
Anyway, bear with me.

00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:11.530
I picked up a hand-sized stone,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.623
threw it as far as I was able,

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.694
it was about 22 meters.

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:22.032
I then cleared all the stones within that radius

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:25.834
and made a pile.

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:28.238
And that was the pile, by the way.

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:31.735
And then, I stood on the pile,

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:35.604
and threw all of those rocks out again,

00:04:35.604 --> 00:04:40.822
and here is rearranged desert.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.800
You could say, well, it doesn't look very different

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.919
from when he started.

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.122
(Laughter)

00:04:46.122 --> 00:04:47.756
What's all the fuss about?

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:49.124
In fact, Chris was worried and said,

00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.518
"Look, don't show them that slide,

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:52.477
because they're just going to think you're another one of

00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:55.143
those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.

00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:57.513
(Laughter)

00:04:57.513 --> 00:05:04.222
But the fact is, this is evidence

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:07.757
of a living body on other bodies,

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:13.596
rocks that have been the subject of geological formation,

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:18.610
erosion, the action of time on objects.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.132
This is a place, in a way, that I just

00:05:21.132 --> 00:05:24.613
would like you to, in a way, look at differently

00:05:24.613 --> 00:05:28.284
because of this event that has happened in it,

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:30.339
a human event,

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.891
and in general, it just asks us to look again

00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.450
at this world, so different from, in a way,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.721
the world that we have been sharing with each other,

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:42.147
the technological world,

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:46.841
to look again at the elemental world.

00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:52.550
The elemental world that we all live in is that space

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.938
that we all visited together, the darkness of the body.

00:05:56.938 --> 00:06:00.603
I wanted to start again with that environment,

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:04.273
the environment of the intimate, subjective space

00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:08.099
that each of us lives in, but from the other side

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.707
of appearance.

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:13.131
So here is a daily activity of the studio.

00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.770
You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.497
again with my eyes closed, and other people

00:06:19.497 --> 00:06:24.024
are molding me, evidential.

00:06:24.024 --> 00:06:27.672
This is an indexical register of a lived moment

00:06:27.672 --> 00:06:30.855
of a body in time.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:36.578
Can we map that space, using the language of neutrinos

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:41.364
or cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body

00:06:41.364 --> 00:06:46.839
as its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.462
the most traditional Greek idea of pointing?

00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:53.250
In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.908
and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,

00:06:57.908 --> 00:06:59.360
the appearance,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.621
what Aristotle defined as the distinction

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.644
between substance and appearance,

00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:07.711
the thing that makes things visible,

00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:10.766
but here we're working from the other side.

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:14.811
Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane?

00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:20.769
This is a lead case made around the space

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:24.234
that my body occupied, but it's now void.

00:07:24.234 --> 00:07:28.108
This is a work called "Learning To See."

00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:34.392
It's a bit of, well, we could call it night,

00:07:34.392 --> 00:07:38.842
we could call it the 96 percent of gravity

00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:42.403
that we don't know about, dark matter,

00:07:42.403 --> 00:07:45.948
placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:48.861
in space at large, but I don't know if you can see,

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:54.930
the eyes are indicated, they're closed.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.393
It's called "Learning To See" because it's about an object

00:07:58.393 --> 00:08:02.725
that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:06.544
vision or connection with the darkness of the body

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:11.517
that I see as a space of potential.

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:14.592
Can we do it another way, using the language

00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:17.778
of particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body

00:08:17.778 --> 00:08:19.708
as an energy center?

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.766
No longer about statues, no longer having to take that

00:08:22.766 --> 00:08:25.827
duty of standing, the standing of a human body,

00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:29.157
or the standing of a statue, release it,

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:33.415
allow it to be an energy field, a space in space

00:08:33.415 --> 00:08:40.236
that talks about human life, between becoming an entropy

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:44.980
as a sort of concentration of attention,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.049
a human place of possibility in space at large.

00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:53.825
Is there another way?

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:59.924
Dark matter now placed against a horizon.

00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:03.959
If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.089
and then in rooms, and then in buildings,

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:12.791
and then in cities, do they also have a final skin,

00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:15.424
and is that skin perceptual?

00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:18.046
The horizon.

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:20.547
And is art about

00:09:20.547 --> 00:09:26.475
trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?

00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:35.112
Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst

00:09:35.112 --> 00:09:39.863
for a kind of empathy with the experience

00:09:39.863 --> 00:09:45.211
of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here

00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.605
in front of you trying to feel and make a connection

00:09:50.605 --> 00:09:53.911
in this space-time that we are sharing,

00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:57.467
can we use, at it were, the memory of a body,

00:09:57.467 --> 00:10:00.291
of a human space in space to catalyze

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:04.014
an experience, again, firsthand experience,

00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:07.021
of elemental time.

00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:11.545
Human time, industrial time, tested against

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:14.541
the time of the tides, in which these memories

00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:19.500
of a particular body, that could be any body,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.390
multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.775
many times, placed over three square miles,

00:10:28.775 --> 00:10:32.429
a mile out to sea,

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:36.784
disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.

00:10:36.784 --> 00:10:40.053
You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,

00:10:40.053 --> 00:10:43.210
just outside Liverpool.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.675
And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like

00:10:46.675 --> 00:10:49.501
on a typical afternoon.

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.203
The pieces appear and disappear,

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.266
but maybe more importantly --

00:10:54.266 --> 00:10:58.199
this is just looking north from the center of the installation --

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:02.536
they create a field, a field that involves

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:08.298
living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:13.259
a relation with each other and a relation with that limit,

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:17.005
the edge, the horizon.

00:11:17.005 --> 00:11:19.507
Just moving on, is it possible,

00:11:19.507 --> 00:11:24.190
taking that idea of mind, body, body-building,

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.595
to supplant the first body,

00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:29.575
the biological body, with the second,

00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:32.493
the body of architecture and the built environment.

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:37.084
This is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert."

00:11:37.084 --> 00:11:38.702
It's in an undefined location

00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:41.783
and I've never published where it is.

00:11:41.783 --> 00:11:43.673
It's an object for the mind.

00:11:43.673 --> 00:11:47.094
I think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:49.024
Again, the darkness of the body,

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:52.087
now held within this bunker shape

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:55.571
of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,

00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:57.687
a crouching body.

00:11:57.687 --> 00:12:00.674
There's a hole at the anus, penis level.

00:12:00.674 --> 00:12:03.411
There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:07.665
There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,

00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:10.004
concrete with a void interior.

00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:14.187
Again, a site found with a completely flat

00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:18.883
360-degree horizon.

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:23.207
This is just simply asking, again,

00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:27.795
as if we had arrived for the first time,

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:31.931
what is the relationship of the human project

00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:36.044
to time and space?

00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:39.617
Taking that idiom of, as it were,

00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:44.610
the darkness of the body transferred to architecture,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.185
can you use architectural space not for living

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.898
but as a metaphor,

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:53.675
and use its systolic, diastolic

00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:58.494
smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of

00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:04.166
firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:07.462
light and darkness?

00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:12.984
This is a work of some proportion and some weight

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:17.870
that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.282
that are all interconnected

00:13:20.282 --> 00:13:25.114
and that allow certain visual access

00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:27.913
at certain places.

00:13:27.913 --> 00:13:34.616
The last work that I just wanted to share with you

00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:38.418
is "Blind Light," which is perhaps

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.678
the most open work,

00:13:41.678 --> 00:13:43.813
and in a conference of radical openness,

00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:47.821
I think maybe this is as radical as I get,

00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:52.084
using light and water vapor as my materials.

00:13:52.084 --> 00:13:54.470
Here is a box

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.012
filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,

00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:02.051
with a cloud and with very bright light.

00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:05.472
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold,

00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:13.384
you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:15.540
If you hold your hand out in front of you,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.394
you can't see it.

00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:20.660
If you look down, you can't see your feet.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:27.662
You are now consciousness without an object,

00:14:27.662 --> 00:14:31.555
freed from the dimensionful

00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:37.441
and measured way in which life links us

00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:40.531
to the obligatory.

00:14:40.531 --> 00:14:45.508
But this is a space that is actually filled with people,

00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:47.478
disembodied voices,

00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:51.592
and out of that ambient environment,

00:14:51.592 --> 00:14:55.522
when people come close to your own body zone,

00:14:55.522 --> 00:14:59.585
very close, they appear to you as representations.

00:14:59.585 --> 00:15:01.805
When they appear close to the edge,

00:15:01.805 --> 00:15:06.389
they are representations, representations in which

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:10.257
the viewers have become the viewed.

00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:16.108
For me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.

00:15:16.108 --> 00:15:21.513
It's about reasserting our firsthand experience

00:15:21.513 --> 00:15:24.404
in present time.

00:15:24.404 --> 00:15:27.845
As John Cage said,

00:15:27.845 --> 00:15:32.932
"We are not moving towards some kind of goal.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:37.613
We are at the goal, and it is changing with us.

00:15:37.613 --> 00:15:44.049
If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."

00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:46.086
Thank you very much.

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:50.253
