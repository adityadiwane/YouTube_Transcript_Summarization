00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.305
(Music)

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:22.610
Dannielle Hadley: Life
in Pennsylvania means just that:

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.302
life without the possibility of parole.

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.182
For us lifers,

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.411
as we call ourselves,

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:32.455
our only chance for release

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:34.684
is through commutation,

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:39.304
which has only been granted
to two women since 1989,

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:42.105
close to 30 years ago.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:45.959
Our song, "This Is Not Our Home,"

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.887
it tells of our experiences

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:53.204
while doing life without
the possibility of parole.

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:57.683
(Music)

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.300
Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.327
I'm a grandmother.

00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:21.206
I'm a daughter.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.123
I have a son.

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.770
I'm not an angel.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.928
I'm not the devil.

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:32.711
I came to jail

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:36.636
when I was so young.

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:47.292
I spend my time here

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:53.283
inside these prison walls.

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:56.851
Lost friends to death,

00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:03.267
saw some go home.

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:07.090
Watch years pass,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.254
people come and go,

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:21.492
while I do life without parole.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:30.378
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:33.373
I'm doing time here.

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:35.254
This is not my home.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:40.316
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:44.449
Will I see

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.187
my family

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:53.840
or die alone?

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:02.211
As the years go by,

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:07.830
I hold back my tears,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:16.305
because if I cry I'd give in to fear.

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:24.110
I must be strong, have to hold on.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.029
Gotta get through

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.378
another year.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:37.881
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:41.573
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:46.658
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:51.128
Will I see

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250
my family

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.550
or die alone?

00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:08.669
I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.244
I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:16.982
All I'm asking is for forgiveness.

00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:23.921
Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.

00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:34.605
Is there a place for me

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:38.901
in the world out there?

00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:45.800
Will they ever know or care
that I'm chained?

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:54.363
Is there redemption for the sin
of my younger days?

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:58.308
Because I've changed.

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:02.390
Lord knows I've changed.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.596
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:10.916
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:15.630
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.530
Will I see

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.572
my family

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:27.980
or die alone?

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:35.209
Will I see

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.408
