00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.091
I'm a journalist,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.666
so I like to look for the untold stories,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.396
the lives that quietly play out
under the scream of headlines.

00:00:20.977 --> 00:00:24.434
I've also been going about the business
of putting down roots,

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.762
choosing a partner, making babies.

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:29.437
So for the last few years,

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.924
I've been trying to understand

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:34.396
what constitutes
the 21st-century good life,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:39.695
both because I'm fascinated by the moral
and philosophical implications,

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.799
but also because I'm in desperate
need of answers myself.

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.933
We live in tenuous times.

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.587
In fact, for the first time
in American history,

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:53.731
the majority of parents do not think
that their kids will be better off

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:55.187
than they were.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:58.489
This is true of rich and poor,
men and women.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.565
Now, some of you
might hear this and feel sad.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.581
After all, America is deeply invested

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:07.484
in this idea of economic transcendence,

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:11.068
that every generation kind of
leapfrogs the one before it,

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:14.790
earning more, buying more, being more.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.457
We've exported this dream
all over the world,

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.390
so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.783
inherit our insatiable expectation

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:24.354
for more.

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:28.120
But when I read this historic poll
for the first time,

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:30.117
it didn't actually make me feel sad.

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.339
It felt like a provocation.

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.014
"Better off" -- based on whose standards?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.113
Is "better off" finding a secure job

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:41.628
that you can count on
for the rest of your life?

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:43.764
Those are nearly extinct.

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:47.785
People move jobs, on average,
every 4.7 years,

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:49.770
and it's estimated that by 2020,

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:52.650
nearly half of Americans
will be freelancers.

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:56.474
OK, so is better off just a number?

00:01:56.498 --> 00:01:59.465
Is it about earning
as much as you possibly can?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.292
By that singular measurement,
we are failing.

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:07.513
Median per capita income
has been flat since about 2000,

00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:09.099
adjusted for inflation.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.234
All right, so is better off getting
a big house with a white picket fence?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.147
Less of us are doing that.

00:02:16.718 --> 00:02:20.374
Nearly five million people lost
their homes in the Great Recession,

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:24.772
and even more of us sobered up
about the lengths we were willing to go --

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:27.543
or be tricked into going,
in many predatory cases --

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:29.074
to hold that deed.

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:33.258
Home-ownership rates
are at their lowest since 1995.

00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:37.465
All right, so we're not
finding steady employment,

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.222
we're not earning as much money,

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:41.658
and we're not living in big fancy houses.

00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:44.087
Toll the funeral bells

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.680
for everything that made America great.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:49.299
But,

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:53.673
are those the best measurements
of a country's greatness,

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:55.198
of a life well lived?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.455
What I think makes America great
is its spirit of reinvention.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.752
In the wake of the Great Recession,

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:05.933
more and more Americans are redefining
what "better off" really means.

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:10.398
Turns out, it has more to do
with community and creativity

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.107
than dollars and cents.

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:14.956
Now, let me be very clear:

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.673
the 14.8 percent of Americans
living in poverty need money,

00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:22.077
plain and simple.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.762
And all of us need policies
that protect us from exploitation

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:28.987
by employers and financial institutions.

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:33.662
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest
that the gap between rich and poor

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:37.057
is anything but profoundly immoral.

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:39.529
But,

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.192
too often we let
the conversation stop there.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:46.529
We talk about poverty as if
it were a monolithic experience;

00:03:46.553 --> 00:03:49.300
about the poor as if
they were solely victims.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:52.983
Part of what I've learned
in my research and reporting

00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.413
is that the art of living well

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:58.425
is often practiced most masterfully

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.555
by the most vulnerable.

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:04.745
Now, if necessity
is the mother of invention,

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.467
I've come to believe

00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.308
that recession can be
the father of consciousness.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.717
It confronts us with profound questions,

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.884
questions we might be too lazy
or distracted to ask

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.581
in times of relative comfort.

00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:20.610
How should we work?

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:21.947
How should we live?

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:25.005
All of us, whether we realize it or not,

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.601
seek answers to these questions,

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.790
with our ancestors
kind of whispering in our ears.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.143
My great-grandfather
was a drunk in Detroit,

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:37.730
who sometimes managed
to hold down a factory job.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.527
He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:43.422
21 children,

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:45.828
with one woman, my great-grandmother,

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.252
who died at 47 years old
of ovarian cancer.

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.880
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,

00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:56.478
and I cannot even fathom
what she must have gone through.

00:04:56.502 --> 00:05:00.088
And if you're trying to do the math --
there were six sets of twins.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.548
So my grandfather, their son,

00:05:03.572 --> 00:05:05.271
became a traveling salesman,

00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:06.790
and he lived boom and bust.

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:10.500
So my dad grew up answering
the door for debt collectors

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:12.519
and pretending his parents weren't home.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.159
He actually took his braces off himself
with pliers in the garage,

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.342
when his father admitted
he didn't have money

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.040
to go back to the orthodontist.

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.549
So my dad, unsurprisingly,

00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:26.641
became a bankruptcy lawyer.

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.713
Couldn't write this in a novel, right?

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:32.517
He was obsessed with providing
a secure foundation

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.887
for my brother and I.

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.268
So I ask these questions
by way of a few generations of struggle.

00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:41.952
My parents made sure that I grew up
on a kind of steady ground

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:45.293
that allows one to question
and risk and leap.

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.223
And ironically, and probably
sometimes to their frustration,

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:52.531
it is their steadfast
commitment to security

00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:55.020
that allows me to question its value,

00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:58.022
or at least its value
as we've historically defined it

00:05:58.046 --> 00:05:59.759
in the 21st century.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.854
So let's dig into this first question:

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:05.048
How should we work?

00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:09.008
We should work like our mothers.

00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:11.893
That's right -- we've spent decades

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.947
trying to fit women into a work world
built for company men.

00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:18.248
And many have done backbends to fit in,

00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:20.897
but others have carved
a more unconventional path,

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:23.851
creating a patchwork of meaning and money

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:26.596
with enough flexibility
to do what they need to do

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.286
for those that they love.

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:31.159
My mom called it "just making it work."

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:35.043
Today I hear life coaches
call it "a portfolio career."

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.615
Whatever you call it,

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.708
more and more men are craving
these whole, if not harried, lives.

00:06:43.332 --> 00:06:47.690
They're waking up to their desire
and duty to be present fathers and sons.

00:06:48.547 --> 00:06:50.984
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,

00:06:51.008 --> 00:06:53.523
"Labor is a way of knowing."

00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:55.746
Labor is a way of knowing.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.778
In other words, what we work on

00:06:57.802 --> 00:07:00.305
is what we understand about the world.

00:07:01.043 --> 00:07:03.242
If this is true, and I think it is,

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:06.838
then women who have disproportionately
cared for the little ones

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:08.839
and the sick ones and the aging ones,

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:11.795
have disproportionately benefited

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.349
from the most profound kind
of knowing there is:

00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:17.518
knowing the human condition.

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:20.594
By prioritizing care,

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:23.194
men are, in a sense, staking their claim

00:07:23.218 --> 00:07:26.121
to the full range of human existence.

00:07:27.097 --> 00:07:30.233
Now, this means the nine-to-five
no longer works for anyone.

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:33.511
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,
as are career ladders.

00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:36.603
Whole industries are being born
and dying every day.

00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:38.558
It's all nonlinear from here.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.102
So we need to stop asking kids,

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.182
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:46.510
and start asking them,
"How do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:49.146
Their work will constantly change.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.145
The common denominator is them.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.445
So the more they understand their gifts

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:55.924
and create crews of ideal collaborators,

00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:57.788
the better off they will be.

00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:01.380
The challenge ahead is to reinvent
the social safety net

00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:04.341
to fit this increasingly
fragmented economy.

00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:06.224
We need portable health benefits.

00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:09.857
We need policies that reflect
that everyone deserves to be vulnerable

00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:11.379
or care for vulnerable others,

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.011
without becoming destitute.

00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:15.683
We need to seriously consider
a universal basic income.

00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:17.904
We need to reinvent labor organizing.

00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:22.548
The promise of a work world
that is structured to actually fit

00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:24.472
our 21st century values,

00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:27.433
not some archaic idea
about bringing home the bacon,

00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:29.647
is long overdue --

00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:31.054
just ask your mother.

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.579
Now, how about the second question:

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:34.832
How should we live?

00:08:35.737 --> 00:08:37.483
We should live

00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:39.579
like our immigrant ancestors.

00:08:41.174 --> 00:08:42.611
When they came to America,

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:46.865
they often shared apartments,
survival tactics, child care --

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:48.895
always knew how to fill one more belly,

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:51.179
no matter how small the food available.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.336
But they were told that success meant
leaving the village behind

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.412
and pursuing that iconic symbol
of the American Dream,

00:08:58.436 --> 00:08:59.912
the white picket fence.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.484
And even today,
we see a white picket fence

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:04.881
and we think success, self-possession.

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:07.136
But when you strip away
the sentimentality,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.536
what it really does is divides us.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.713
Many Americans are rejecting
the white picket fence

00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:16.052
and the kind of highly privatized life
that happened within it,

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:17.866
and reclaiming village life,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.470
reclaiming interdependence instead.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.914
Fifty million of us, for example,

00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:25.613
live in intergenerational households.

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:28.746
This number exploded
with the Great Recession,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.408
but it turns out people
actually like living this way.

00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:35.280
Two-thirds of those who are living
with multiple generations under one roof

00:09:35.304 --> 00:09:37.673
say it's improved their relationships.

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:40.969
Some people are choosing
to share homes not with family,

00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:44.353
but with other people who understand
the health and economic benefits

00:09:44.377 --> 00:09:46.058
of daily community.

00:09:46.082 --> 00:09:49.716
CoAbode, an online platform
for single moms looking to share homes

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.103
with other single moms,

00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:53.118
has 50,000 users.

00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.398
And people over 65 are especially prone

00:09:56.422 --> 00:09:59.571
to be looking for these alternative
living arrangements.

00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:02.573
They understand that their quality of life

00:10:02.597 --> 00:10:06.846
depends on a mix
of solitude and solidarity.

00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:10.220
Which is true of all of us
when you think about it,

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.608
young and old alike.

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:15.663
For too long, we've pretended
that happiness is a king in his castle.

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:18.477
But all the research proves otherwise.

00:10:19.006 --> 00:10:22.009
It shows that the healthiest,
happiest and even safest --

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:28.107
in terms of both climate change disaster,
in terms of crime, all of that --

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:31.963
are Americans who live lives
intertwined with their neighbors.

00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:34.558
Now, I've experienced this firsthand.

00:10:35.076 --> 00:10:38.268
For the last few years, I've been living
in a cohousing community.

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:41.901
It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,

00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:45.677
this prolific blackberry bush
that snakes around a community garden,

00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:48.914
all smack-dab, by the way,
in the middle of urban Oakland.

00:10:49.447 --> 00:10:51.566
The nine units are all built
to be different,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.239
different sizes, different shapes,

00:10:53.263 --> 00:10:55.377
but they're meant to be
as green as possible.

00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.544
So big, shiny black
solar cells on our roof

00:10:57.568 --> 00:10:59.502
mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.144
more than five bucks in a month.

00:11:01.787 --> 00:11:05.598
The 25 of us who live there are all
different ages and political persuasions

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:06.780
and professions,

00:11:06.804 --> 00:11:10.082
and we live in homes that have everything
a typical home would have.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.260
But additionally,

00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:13.800
we share an industrial-sized
kitchen and eating area,

00:11:13.824 --> 00:11:15.889
where we have common meals twice a week.

00:11:15.913 --> 00:11:18.152
Now, people, when I tell them
I live like this,

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:20.082
often have one of two extreme reactions.

00:11:20.106 --> 00:11:22.755
Either they say, "Why doesn't
everyone live like this?"

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:25.507
Or they say, "That sounds
totally horrifying.

00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:27.030
I would never want to do that."

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:32.201
So let me reassure you: there is
a sacred respect for privacy among us,

00:11:32.614 --> 00:11:36.931
but also a commitment to what we call
"radical hospitality" --

00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:39.958
not the kind advertised
by the Four Seasons,

00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:46.331
but the kind that says that every
single person is worthy of kindness,

00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:48.113
full stop, end of sentence.

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:52.606
The biggest surprise for me
of living in a community like this?

00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:57.086
You share all the domestic labor --
the repairing, the cooking, the weeding --

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.173
but you also share the emotional labor.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:02.596
Rather than depending only
on the idealized family unit

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.488
to get all of your emotional needs met,

00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:06.921
you have two dozen other people
that you can go to

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.781
to talk about a hard day at work

00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:11.490
or troubleshoot how to handle
an abusive teacher.

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:17.602
Teenagers in our community will often go
to an adult that is not their parent

00:12:17.626 --> 00:12:18.885
to ask for advice.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.829
It's what bell hooks
called "revolutionary parenting,"

00:12:22.853 --> 00:12:24.651
this humble acknowledgment

00:12:24.675 --> 00:12:27.771
that kids are healthier when they have
a wider range of adults

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.635
to emulate and count on.

00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:33.052
Turns out, adults are healthier, too.

00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:35.156
It's a lot of pressure,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.084
trying to be that perfect family
behind that white picket fence.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.634
The "new better off,"
as I've come to call it,

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:45.614
is less about investing
in the perfect family

00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:49.123
and more about investing
in the imperfect village,

00:12:49.147 --> 00:12:51.373
whether that's relatives
living under one roof,

00:12:51.397 --> 00:12:53.237
a cohousing community like mine,

00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.191
or just a bunch of neighbors
who pledge to really know

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:57.721
and look out for one another.

00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:00.003
It's good common sense, right?

00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:03.273
And yet, money has often made us dumb

00:13:03.297 --> 00:13:04.662
about reaching out.

00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:07.608
The most reliable wealth

00:13:07.632 --> 00:13:10.191
is found in relationship.

00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:14.731
The new better off is not
an individual prospect at all.

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:18.453
In fact, if you're a failure
or you think you're a failure,

00:13:18.477 --> 00:13:20.088
I've got some good news for you:

00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:23.902
you might be a success by standards
you have not yet honored.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:27.810
Maybe you're a mediocre earner
but a masterful father.

00:13:28.477 --> 00:13:30.359
Maybe you can't afford your dream home,

00:13:30.383 --> 00:13:33.089
but you throw legendary
neighborhood parties.

00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:36.226
If you're a textbook success,

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.741
the implications of what I'm saying
could be more grim for you.

00:13:40.344 --> 00:13:43.685
You might be a failure
by standards you hold dear

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:46.111
but that the world doesn't reward.

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:48.119
Only you can know.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.526
I know that I am not a tribute

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.036
to my great-grandmother,

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.729
who lived such a short and brutish life,

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.916
if I earn enough money to afford
every creature comfort.

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:03.743
You can't buy your way
out of suffering or into meaning.

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:05.501
There is no home big enough

00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:08.547
to erase the pain
that she must have endured.

00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:10.685
I am a tribute to her

00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:15.156
if I live a life as connected
and courageous as possible.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:19.257
In the midst of such
widespread uncertainty,

00:14:19.281 --> 00:14:21.494
we may, in fact, be insecure.

00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:24.860
But we can let that insecurity
make us brittle

00:14:25.216 --> 00:14:26.375
or supple.

00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:31.866
We can turn inward, lose faith
in the power of institutions to change --

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.804
even lose faith in ourselves.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:35.736
Or we can turn outward,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.385
cultivate faith in our ability
to reach out, to connect, to create.

00:14:43.063 --> 00:14:45.457
Turns out, the biggest danger

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.878
is not failing to achieve
the American Dream.

00:14:49.624 --> 00:14:52.062
The biggest danger is achieving a dream

00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:54.449
that you don't actually believe in.

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:56.592
So don't do that.

00:14:57.046 --> 00:14:59.688
Do the harder, more interesting thing,

00:14:59.712 --> 00:15:03.760
which is to compose a life
where what you do every single day,

00:15:03.784 --> 00:15:07.462
the people you give your best love
and ingenuity and energy to,

00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:10.496
aligns as closely as possible
with what you believe.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.415
That, not something as mundane
as making money,

00:15:14.439 --> 00:15:16.408
is a tribute to your ancestors.

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:20.043
That is the beautiful struggle.

00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:22.052
Thank you.

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:31.255
(Applause)
