00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:36.260
(Music)

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:10.260
(Applause)

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
Okay, so first of all,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
(Applause)

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
Burniss Travis on the bass,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
(Applause)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
(Applause)

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So the bandstand, as we call it,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
this is an incredible space.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
It is really a sacred space.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And one of the things that is really sacred about it

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
is that you have no opportunity to think about the future,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
or the past.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
You really are alive right here in this moment.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
There are so many decisions being made

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
when you walk on the bandstand.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
In the middle, we sort of made our way

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
into a song called "Titi Boom."

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
Everyone's listening. We're responding.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
You have no time for projected ideas.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
So the idea of a mistake:

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
From the perspective of a jazz musician,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
The only mistake lies

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
in that I'm not able to perceive

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
what it is that someone else did.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
So it's hard to even describe

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
what a funny note would be.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
that sounded like this ...

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
(Music)

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
(Music)

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
See, these are all right inside of the color palette.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
If you played an E.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
See, these all lie right inside

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of this general emotional palette that we were painting.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
If you played an F# though,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.260
(Dissonance)

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And we're going to play on this palette.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
And we won't react to it.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
He'll introduce it for a second

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
We'll see what happens when we play with this palette.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:24.260
(Music)

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.260
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
The only way that I would say it was a mistake

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
is in that we didn't react to it.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
It was an opportunity that was missed.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
We'll all accept his ideas,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
or not.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:09.260
(Music)

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
So you see, he played this note.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
I ended up creating a melody out of it.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
The texture changed in the drums this time.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
in response to how I responded to it.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
So there is no mistake.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
The only mistake is if I'm not aware,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
if each individual musician is not aware

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
and accepting enough of his fellow band member

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
It's a very purifying experience.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Well we're jazz musicians,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
(Laughter)

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And the other dynamic of it

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
is that we don't micromanage in jazz.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
You have some people who do.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But what that does

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
is it actually limits the artistic possibilities.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
If I come up and I dictate to the band

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and I just jump right in ...

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
ready, just play some time.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
One, two, one, two, three, four.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:32.260
(Music)

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
If I really want the music to go there,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
the best way for me to do it is to listen.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
This is a science of listening.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
It has far more to do with what I can perceive

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
than what it is that I can do.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
the first step for me is

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
to be patient, to listen to what's going on

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and pull from something that's going on around me.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
and they give you more, and gradually it builds.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Music)

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
It's about being here in the moment,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
accepting one another

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
and allowing creativity to flow.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
Thank you.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.260
(Applause)
