00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I have spent the past few years

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
putting myself into situations

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that are usually very difficult

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
and at the same time somewhat dangerous.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I went to prison --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
difficult.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
I worked in a coal mine --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
dangerous.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I filmed in war zones --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
difficult and dangerous.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.260
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
fun in the beginning,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
In fact, most of my career,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
I've been immersing myself

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
into seemingly horrible situations

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
for the whole goal of trying

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
to examine societal issues

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that hopefully break them down in a way

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So when I knew I was coming here

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I knew I would want to do something a little different.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
So as some of you may or may not have heard,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
I sent out some Facebook messages,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
some Twitter messages,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
to my 2011 TED Talk.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
(Laughter)

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
That's right, some lucky individual, corporation,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
for-profit or non-profit,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again --

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
(Laughter)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
to buy the naming rights

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
to the talk you're watching right now,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and didn't really give much hint

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
as to what the subject matter would actually be.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
So what you were getting was this:

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Your name here presents:

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
But that being said,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
it's a very good media opportunity.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.260
(Laughter)

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
You know how many people watch these TED Talks?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's a lot.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
That's just a working title, by the way.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
(Laughter)

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So even with that caveat,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.260
we examine the world of marketing, advertising.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And as I said earlier,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
for anything as difficult

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
or as dangerous

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
as going into the rooms with these guys.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
(Laughter)

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
You see, I had this idea for a movie.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
all about product placement, marketing and advertising,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
where the entire film is funded

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
by product placement, marketing and advertising.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
is branded from beginning to end --

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
which is brand X.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the Staples Center ...

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
That was more for emphasis.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever."

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
The goal of this whole film is transparency.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
So that's the whole concept,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
the whole film, start to finish.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
because when I first hear it,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
it is the ultimate respect

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
for an audience.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Guy: I don't know how receptive

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
people are going to be to it, though.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
XK: Do you have a perspective --

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
but I think it's certainly worth pursuing

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
a couple big, really obvious brands.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
MS: What do you think the response is going to be?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
or a tough sell because of me?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
JK: Both.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
So, sir, can you help me? I need help.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
MK: I can help you.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
MS: Okay. (MK: Good.)

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
Awesome.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
When you look at the people you deal with ..

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Turn the camera off.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off"

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Turns out it really means,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
"We want nothing to do with your movie."

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
MS: And just like that, one by one,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
all of these companies suddenly disappeared.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I was amazed.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
to get as many people to see it as possible.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
Especially in today's world,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
this intersection of new media and old media

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
and the fractured media landscape,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
isn't the idea to get

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
that's going to get that message to the masses?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
No, that's what I thought.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
But the problem was, you see,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
my idea had one fatal flaw,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
and that flaw was this.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
This would have been fine.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
But what this image represents was the problem.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
this is ---

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
(Laughter)

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
(Applause)

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
This is one of the first images that comes up.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.260
(Laughter)

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
This is was the problem: transparency --

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
free from pretense or deceit;

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
easily detected or seen through;

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
readily understood;

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
especially concerning business practices --

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
that last line being probably the biggest problem.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
Our politicians say it, our president says it,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
even our CEO's say it.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
something suddenly changes.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
But why? Well, transparency is scary --

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
(Roar)

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
like that odd, still-screaming bear.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
(Laughter)

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
It's unpredictable --

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
(Music)

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
(Laughter)

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
like this odd country road.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
And it's also very risky.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
(Laughter)

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
What else is risky?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.260
(Laughter)

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
That's very risky.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Now when I started talking to companies

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
We want you to tell a story,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
but we just want to tell our story."

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
See, when I was a kid

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.260
he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
There's your story,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
there's my story

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and there's the real story."

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260
and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
I realized that I would have to go on my own,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I'd have to cut out the middleman

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and go to the companies myself with all of my team.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
So what you suddenly started to realize --

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
or what I started to realize --

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
is that when you started having conversations with these companies,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.260
and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
say the reason their films are so successful

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
is because of the brand partners that they have.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
And then my friends who make small independent films

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
And the movie is called

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
you will see Ban deodorant.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.260
While anytime I do an interview with someone,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
I want to help you calm down.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
So maybe you should put some one before the interview."

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
they'll have their chance.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
We will have them geared for both male or female --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
That's the two-cent tour.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
So now I can answer any of your questions

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and give you the five-cent tour.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
we're very much a challenger brand.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
So doing things like this -- you know,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
remind people about Ban --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
is kind of why were interested in it.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Ban is blank.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
KF: That's a great question.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.260
(Laughter)

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Woman: Superior technology.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
somebody's putting in their armpit.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Man: We talk about bold, fresh.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
versus "fights odor and wetness."

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
It keeps you fresh.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
more freshness, three times fresher.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
What about me? What about a regular guy?

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
I need to go talk to the man on the street,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
the people who are like me, the regular Joes.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
They need to tell me about my brand.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
Man: Um, my brand?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
I don't know.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
I like really nice clothes.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
Woman: 80's revival

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
meets skater-punk,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
unless it's laundry day.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
would be like dark glamor.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
I like a lot of black colors,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
a lot of grays and stuff like that.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
But usually I have an accessory,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
like sunglasses,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
or I like crystal and things like that too.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Woman: If Dan were a brand,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.260
he might be a classic convertible

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Mercedes Benz.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
Man 2: The brand that I am

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
is, I would call it casual fly.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
So I guess that's my brand.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
Is that something?

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.260
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Tom: I'm Tom.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
(Laughter)

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
And what I realized is I needed an expert.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
I needed somebody who could get inside my head,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
somebody who could really help me understand

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
what they call your "brand personality."

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
discover that brand personality.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
MS: I did. The very first picture

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
is a picture of my family.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
A: Tell me about this world.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
like people who are around you, your friends, your family,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
the way you live your life, the job you do.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
All those things stemmed and started from one place,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
MS: It's like, who do I want to be?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
I like things that are different.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
I like things that are weird. I like weird things.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Tell me a little bit about that part.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
... A little more about you that is not who you are.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
that you had two distinct, but complementary

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
sides to your brand personality --

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
And I think some companies

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
will just focus on one of their strengths or the other

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
instead of focusing on both.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to avoid things that they're not sure of,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
avoid fear, those elements,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
and you really embrace those,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
What other brands are like that?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
The first on here is the classic, Apple.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
And you can see here too, Target, Wii,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
those things that have come and gone,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
what would you be?

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Or are you more of a down attribute?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
Up attributes are things like being playful,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
being fresh like the Fresh Prince,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
contemporary, adventurous,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
nimble or agile, profane, domineering,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
magical or mystical like Gandalf.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
Or are you more of a down attribute?

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
empathetic like the Oprah?

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
Are you reliable, stable, familiar,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
safe, secure, sacred,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
contemplative or wise

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.260
Over the course of this film,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
we had 500-plus companies

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
who were up and down companies

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
they would have no control over the final product.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
But we did get 17 brand partners

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
who were willing to relinquish that control,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
who wanted to be in business

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
with someone as mindful and as playful as myself

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
that normally we wouldn't be able to tell --

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.260
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
as we got into telling the story in this film

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
about how now they're using MRI's

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
to target the desire centers of your brain

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
for both commercials as well as movie marketing.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
In the entire city for the past five years,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
(Applause)

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
And we went to school districts

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
where now companies are making their way

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
into cash-strapped schools all across America.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.260
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
or I've had the most success in,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.260
are ones where I've interacted with things directly.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
And that's what these brands did.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
and said, "Maybe these agencies

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
don't have my best interest in mind.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
I'm going to work with him to create something different,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
something that's going to get people thinking,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
That's only online -- no print, no TV.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
So ultimately,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260
this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
advised their clients not to take part.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
What I always believe

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
is that if you take chances, if you take risks,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
that in those risks will come opportunity.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.260
I believe that when you push people away from that,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
you're pushing them more towards failure.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
then you're preparing your whole company

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
to be reward challenged.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.260
is we need to encourage people to take risks.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
We need to encourage people to not be afraid

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
of opportunities that may scare them.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
Ultimately, moving forward,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
I think we have to embrace fear.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.260
We've got to put that bear in a cage.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:51.260
(Laughter)

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
Embrace fear. Embrace risk.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.260
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
Today, more than ever,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
a little honesty is going to go a long way.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
And that being said, through honesty and transparency,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.260
my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260
has been brought to you

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
by my good friends at EMC,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
who for $7,100

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
bought the naming rights on eBay.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:29.260
(Applause)

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.260
EMC: Turning big data

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.260
into big opportunity

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
for organizations all over the world.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
Thank you very much, guys.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:54.260
(Applause)

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
June Cohen: So, Morgan,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
in the name of transparency,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.260
what exactly happened to that $7,100?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
MS: That is a fantastic question.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.260
I have in my pocket a check

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
made out to the parent organization to the TED organization,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
the Sapling Foundation --

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
a check for $7,100

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.260
to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.260
(Laughter)

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.260
(Applause)
