00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:18.071
The world makes you something that you're not,

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.972
but you know inside what you are,

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:23.852
and that question burns in your heart:

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:26.846
How will you become that?

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:29.212
I may be somewhat unique in this,

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:31.241
but I am not alone,

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.341
not alone at all.

00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:36.461
So when I became a fashion model,

00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.161
I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.417
that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:45.547
My outside self finally matched my inner truth,

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:47.925
my inner self.

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:52.082
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:55.030
when I look at this picture,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.574
at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:58.913
you've made it,

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.734
you have arrived.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:04.324
But this past October,

00:01:04.324 --> 00:01:08.982
I realized that I'm only just beginning.

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:13.112
All of us are put in boxes by our family,

00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:14.782
by our religion,

00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:16.726
by our society,

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:19.099
our moment in history,

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:21.571
even our own bodies.

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.347
Some people have the courage to break free,

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:26.786
not to accept the limitations imposed by

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.506
the color of their skin

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:32.293
or by the beliefs of those that surround them.

00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:34.085
Those people are always the threat

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:35.309
to the status quo,

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:39.804
to what is considered acceptable.

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:45.593
In my case, for the last nine years,

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:47.287
some of my neighbors,

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:50.291
some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.901
did not know about my history.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.657
I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.

00:01:56.657 --> 00:02:00.282
Here is mine.

00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:03.095
I was assigned boy at birth

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.177
based on the appearance of my genitalia.

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:08.095
I remember when I was five years old

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:10.575
in the Philippines walking around our house,

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.946
I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:15.441
And my mom asked me,

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.021
"How come you always wear
that t-shirt on your head?"

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:23.219
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.656
I knew then how to self-identify.

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:32.363
Gender has always been considered a fact,

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:34.235
immutable,

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:37.862
but we now know it's actually more fluid,

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:41.877
complex and mysterious.

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:44.290
Because of my success, I never had the courage

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.940
to share my story,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.553
not because I thought what I am is wrong,

00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:52.555
but because of how the world treats those of us

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.757
who wish to break free.

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:57.495
Every day,

00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:01.431
I am so grateful because I am a woman.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.907
I have a mom and dad and family

00:03:04.907 --> 00:03:07.752
who accepted me for who I am.

00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:12.631
Many are not so fortunate.

00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:14.706
There's a long tradition in Asian culture

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:18.284
that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.085
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.

00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:25.351
There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.700
So when I was eight years old,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.428
these mysteries.

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.866
I was in front of the stage,

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.977
and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.137
right in front of me,

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:41.423
and I remember that moment something hit me:

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:45.133
That is the kind of woman I would like to be.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.693
So when I was 15 years old,

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.110
still dressing as a boy,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.524
I met this woman named T.L.

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:55.188
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.

00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:56.870
That night she asked me,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.636
"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:01.852
She convinced me that if I joined

00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:05.175
that she would take care of the registration fee

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:06.787
and the garments,

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:08.946
and that night,

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:11.026
I won best in swimsuit

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.540
and best in long gown

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.189
and placed second runner up

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.928
among 40-plus candidates.

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:20.554
That moment changed my life.

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.197
All of a sudden, I was introduced

00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:25.066
to the world of beauty pageants.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.890
Not a lot of people could say that your first job

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.702
is a pageant queen for transgender women,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.578
but I'll take it.

00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:34.871
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.338
the most prestigious pageant

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:41.879
to the pageant where it's at
the back of the truck, literally,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.046
or sometimes it would be a
pavement next to a rice field,

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:46.967
and when it rains --

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:49.714
it rains a lot in the Philippines --

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:51.022
the organizers would have to move it

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:55.097
inside someone's house.

00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:57.374
I also experienced the goodness of strangers,

00:04:57.374 --> 00:04:58.719
especially when we would travel

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.688
in remote provinces in the Philippines.

00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:03.179
But most importantly, I met

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:06.571
some of my best friends in that community.

00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:08.997
In 2001,

00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:11.024
my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,

00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:14.851
called me and told me that my
green card petition came through,

00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:18.134
that I could now move to the United States.

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.528
I resisted it.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.597
I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.

00:05:21.597 --> 00:05:22.507
I'm here with my friends,

00:05:22.507 --> 00:05:26.041
I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:29.138
But then two weeks later she called me, she said,

00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:31.835
"Did you know that if you move to the United States

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:35.068
you could change your name and gender marker?"

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.113
That was all I needed to hear.

00:05:38.113 --> 00:05:39.949
My mom also told me to put two E's

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.030
in the spelling of my name.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.413
She also came with me when I had my surgery

00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:47.412
in Thailand at 19 years old.

00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:50.940
It's interesting, in some of the
most rural cities in Thailand,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.051
they perform some of the most prestigious,

00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:58.440
safe and sophisticated surgery.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.075
At that time in the United States,

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.543
you needed to have surgery

00:06:01.543 --> 00:06:04.858
before you could change your
name and gender marker.

00:06:04.858 --> 00:06:09.094
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,

00:06:09.094 --> 00:06:13.523
and I remember looking at
my California driver's license

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:15.509
with the name Geena

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.913
and gender marker F.

00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:20.505
That was a powerful moment.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.367
For some people,

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.294
their I.D. is their license to drive

00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:26.741
or even to get a drink,

00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:30.395
but for me, that was my license to live,

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.937
to feel dignified.

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:35.524
All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:37.881
I felt that I could conquer my dream

00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:41.778
and move to New York and be a model.

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:45.085
Many are not so fortunate.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:48.536
I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:50.504
She's from New York, she's a young woman

00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:53.024
who was courageously living her truth,

00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:56.077
but hatred ended her life.

00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:58.638
For most of my community,

00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:01.570
this is the reality in which we live.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.058
Our suicide rate is nine times higher

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.994
than that of the general population.

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:08.961
Every November 20,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.927
we have a global vigil

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:14.077
for Transgender Day of Remembrance.

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:15.438
I'm here at this stage

00:07:15.438 --> 00:07:18.287
because it's a long history of people who fought

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.551
and stood up for injustice.

00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:25.076
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:28.797
Today, this very moment,

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:31.924
is my real coming out.

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:34.487
I could no longer live my truth

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.318
for and by myself.

00:07:37.318 --> 00:07:39.483
I want to do my best to help others

00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:44.236
live their truth without shame and terror.

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:48.819
I am here, exposed,

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.261
so that one day there will never be a need

00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:55.132
for a November 20 vigil.

00:07:55.132 --> 00:08:01.397
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.182
Will you?

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.156
Thank you very much.

00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:08.113
(Applause)

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:12.899
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.376
Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:18.213
I'm wondering what you would say,

00:08:18.213 --> 00:08:20.086
especially to parents,

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:22.043
but in a more broad way, to friends,

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.607
to family, to anyone who finds themselves

00:08:24.607 --> 00:08:26.729
encountering a child or a person

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:28.289
who is struggling with and uncomfortable with

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:30.178
a gender that's being assigned them,

00:08:30.178 --> 00:08:32.019
what might you say

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:34.178
to the family members of that person

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:36.957
to help them become good and caring and kind

00:08:36.957 --> 00:08:38.571
family members to them?

00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:40.623
Geena Rocero: Sure. Well,
first, really, I'm so blessed.

00:08:40.623 --> 00:08:43.724
The support system, with my mom especially,

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:45.430
and my family, that in itself

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.691
is just so powerful.

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:49.511
I remember every time I would coach

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:52.063
young trans women, I would mentor them,

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:54.481
and sometimes when they would call me

00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:56.984
and tell me that their parents can't accept it,

00:08:56.984 --> 00:08:58.790
I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.113
"Mom, can you call this woman?"

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:03.614
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so —

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:07.128
But it's just, gender identity

00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:09.500
is in the core of our being, right?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.142
I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:15.017
so what I'm trying to do

00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:17.488
is to have this conversation that

00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:20.897
sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,

00:09:20.897 --> 00:09:22.828
and there should be a space

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:25.523
that would allow people to self-identify,

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.130
and that's a conversation that we should have

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.222
with parents, with colleagues.

00:09:30.222 --> 00:09:31.597
The transgender movement,

00:09:31.597 --> 00:09:34.222
it's at the very beginning,

00:09:34.222 --> 00:09:37.181
to compare to how the gay movement started.

00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:39.731
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.

00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:41.336
There should be an understanding.

00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:43.295
There should be a space of curiosity

00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:45.869
and asking questions,

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:48.512
and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.

00:09:48.512 --> 00:09:50.759
KS: Thank you. That was so lovely.
GR: Thank you.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:54.147
