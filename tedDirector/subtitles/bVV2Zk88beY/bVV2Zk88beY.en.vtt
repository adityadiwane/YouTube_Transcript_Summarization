00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.436
I was a blue-eyed,
chubby-cheeked five-year-old

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.580
when I joined my family
on the picket line for the first time.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.780
My mom made me leave
my dolls in the minivan.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.716
I'd stand on a street corner
in the heavy Kansas humidity,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.356
surrounded by a few dozen relatives,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.500
with my tiny fists clutching
a sign that I couldn't read yet:

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.100
"Gays are worthy of death."

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.140
This was the beginning.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.076
Our protests soon became
a daily occurrence

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.036
and an international phenomenon,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.516
and as a member
of Westboro Baptist Church,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.676
I became a fixture
on picket lines across the country.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.036
The end of my antigay picketing career

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.476
and life as I knew it,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.156
came 20 years later,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.676
triggered in part by strangers on Twitter

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.380
who showed me the power
of engaging the other.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.316
In my home,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.460
life was framed as an epic
spiritual battle between good and evil.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.596
The good was my church and its members,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.540
and the evil was everyone else.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.156
My church's antics were such

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.596
that we were constantly
at odds with the world,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.419
and that reinforced
our otherness on a daily basis.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.076
"Make a difference
between the unclean and the clean,"

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.436
the verse says,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.796
and so we did.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.956
From baseball games to military funerals,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.756
we trekked across the country
with neon protest signs in hand

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.756
to tell others exactly
how "unclean" they were

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500
and exactly why
they were headed for damnation.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.620
This was the focus of our whole lives.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.340
This was the only way for me to do good
in a world that sits in Satan's lap.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.156
And like the rest of my 10 siblings,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.636
I believed what I was taught
with all my heart,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.500
and I pursued Westboro's agenda
with a special sort of zeal.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.740
In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.796
Initially, the people
I encountered on the platform

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.036
were just as hostile as I expected.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.556
They were the digital version
of the screaming hordes

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.236
I'd been seeing at protests
since I was a kid.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.716
But in the midst of that digital brawl,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.076
a strange pattern developed.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.756
Someone would arrive at my profile
with the usual rage and scorn,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.916
I would respond with a custom mix
of Bible verses, pop culture references

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.140
and smiley faces.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.436
They would be understandably
confused and caught off guard,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.340
but then a conversation would ensue.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.196
And it was civil --

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.540
full of genuine curiosity on both sides.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.940
How had the other come to such
outrageous conclusions about the world?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.420
Sometimes the conversation
even bled into real life.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.636
People I'd sparred with on Twitter

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.996
would come out
to the picket line to see me

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.500
when I protested in their city.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.700
A man named David was one such person.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.780
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious,"

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.716
and after several months
of heated but friendly arguments online,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.140
he came out to see me
at a picket in New Orleans.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.396
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert
from Jerusalem, where he lives,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.676
and I brought him kosher chocolate

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.756
and held a "God hates Jews" sign.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.836
(Laughter)

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.916
There was no confusion
about our positions,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.100
but the line between friend and foe
was becoming blurred.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.876
We'd started to see each other
as human beings,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.100
and it changed the way
we spoke to one another.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.316
It took time,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.380
but eventually these conversations
planted seeds of doubt in me.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.556
My friends on Twitter took the time
to understand Westboro's doctrines,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.796
and in doing so,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.020
they were able to find inconsistencies
I'd missed my entire life.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.836
Why did we advocate
the death penalty for gays

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.420
when Jesus said, "Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone?"

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.556
How could we claim to love our neighbor

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.180
while at the same time
praying for God to destroy them?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.516
The truth is that the care shown to me
by these strangers on the internet

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.260
was itself a contradiction.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.276
It was growing evidence

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.780
that people on the other side were not
the demons I'd been led to believe.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.020
These realizations were life-altering.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.316
Once I saw that we were not
the ultimate arbiters of divine truth

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.116
but flawed human beings,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.700
I couldn't pretend otherwise.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.716
I couldn't justify our actions --

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.716
especially our cruel practice
of protesting funerals

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.420
and celebrating human tragedy.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.796
These shifts in my perspective

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.916
contributed to a larger erosion
of trust in my church,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.900
and eventually it made it
impossible for me to stay.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.779
In spite of overwhelming grief and terror,
I left Westboro in 2012.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.476
In those days just after I left,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
the instinct to hide
was almost paralyzing.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.396
I wanted to hide
from the judgement of my family,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.636
who I knew would never
speak to me again --

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.580
people whose thoughts and opinions
had meant everything to me.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.476
And I wanted to hide from the world
I'd rejected for so long --

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.236
people who had no reason at all
to give me a second chance

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.220
after a lifetime of antagonism.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.996
And yet, unbelievably,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.476
they did.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.876
The world had access to my past
because it was all over the internet --

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.276
thousands of tweets
and hundreds of interviews,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.796
everything from local TV news
to "The Howard Stern Show" --

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.420
but so many embraced me
with open arms anyway.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.716
I wrote an apology
for the harm I'd caused,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.180
but I also knew that an apology
could never undo any of it.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.036
All I could do was try to build a new life

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.460
and find a way somehow
to repair some of the damage.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.756
People had every reason
to doubt my sincerity,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.020
but most of them didn't.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.900
And --

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.716
given my history,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.676
it was more than I could've hoped for --

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.156
forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.420
It still amazes me.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.900
I spent my first year away from home

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.996
adrift with my younger sister,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.580
who had chosen to leave with me.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.156
We walked into an abyss,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.876
but we were shocked to find
the light and a way forward

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.500
in the same communities
we'd targeted for so long.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.636
David,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.556
my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.316
invited us to spend time among
a Jewish community in Los Angeles.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.556
We slept on couches in the home
of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.780
and their four kids --

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.236
the same rabbi that I'd protested
three years earlier

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.460
with a sign that said,
"Your rabbi is a whore."

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.676
We spent long hours talking
about theology and Judaism and life

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.916
while we washed dishes
in their kosher kitchen

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.660
and chopped vegetables for dinner.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.980
They treated us like family.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.556
They held nothing against us,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.420
and again I was astonished.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.276
That period was full of turmoil,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.596
but one part I've returned to often

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.500
is a surprising realization
I had during that time --

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.596
that it was a relief and a privilege
to let go of the harsh judgments

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.540
that instinctively ran through my mind
about nearly every person I saw.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.220
I realized that now I needed to learn.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.100
I needed to listen.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.476
This has been at the front
of my mind lately,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.436
because I can't help but see
in our public discourse

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.460
so many of the same destructive impulses
that ruled my former church.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.316
We celebrate tolerance and diversity
more than at any other time in memory,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.580
and still we grow more and more divided.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.156
We want good things --

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.796
justice, equality,
freedom, dignity, prosperity --

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.116
but the path we've chosen

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.260
looks so much like the one
I walked away from four years ago.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.316
We've broken the world into us and them,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.396
only emerging from our bunkers long enough

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.660
to lob rhetorical grenades
at the other camp.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.356
We write off half the country
as out-of-touch liberal elites

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.540
or racist misogynist bullies.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.420
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.116
Even when someone does call for empathy
and understanding for the other side,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.036
the conversation nearly always devolves

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.300
into a debate about
who deserves more empathy.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.036
And just as I learned to do,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.596
we routinely refuse to acknowledge
the flaws in our positions

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.260
or the merits in our opponent's.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.820
Compromise is anathema.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.540
We even target people on our own side
when they dare to question the party line.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.116
This path has brought us cruel,
sniping, deepening polarization,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.740
and even outbreaks of violence.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.436
I remember this path.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.620
It will not take us where we want to go.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.620
What gives me hope is that
we can do something about this.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.020
The good news is that it's simple,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.420
and the bad news is that it's hard.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.980
We have to talk and listen
to people we disagree with.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.756
It's hard because we often can't fathom

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.820
how the other side
came to their positions.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.196
It's hard because righteous indignation,

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.396
that sense of certainty
that ours is the right side,

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.979
is so seductive.

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:48.076
It's hard because it means
extending empathy and compassion

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.619
to people who show us
hostility and contempt.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.379
The impulse to respond in kind
is so tempting,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.116
but that isn't who we want to be.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.796
We can resist.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.276
And I will always be inspired to do so
by those people I encountered on Twitter,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.996
apparent enemies
who became my beloved friends.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.436
And in the case of one particularly
understanding and generous guy,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.660
my husband.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.460
There was nothing special
about the way I responded to him.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.020
What was special was their approach.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.476
I thought about it a lot
over the past few years

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.356
and I found four things
they did differently

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.460
that made real conversation possible.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.156
These four steps were small but powerful,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.940
and I do everything I can to employ them
in difficult conversations today.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.260
The first is don't assume bad intent.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.516
My friends on Twitter realized

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.476
that even when my words
were aggressive and offensive,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.396
I sincerely believed
I was doing the right thing.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.396
Assuming ill motives
almost instantly cuts us off

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.716
from truly understanding
why someone does and believes as they do.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.476
We forget that they're a human being

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.476
with a lifetime of experience
that shaped their mind,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.196
and we get stuck
on that first wave of anger,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.820
and the conversation has a very hard time
ever moving beyond it.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.276
But when we assume good or neutral intent,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.300
we give our minds a much stronger
framework for dialogue.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.820
The second is ask questions.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.156
When we engage people
across ideological divides,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.636
asking questions
helps us map the disconnect

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.460
between our differing points of view.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.916
That's important because
we can't present effective arguments

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.300
if we don't understand where
the other side is actually coming from

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.260
and because it gives them an opportunity
to point out flaws in our positions.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.356
But asking questions
serves another purpose;

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.860
it signals to someone
that they're being heard.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.716
When my friends on Twitter
stopped accusing

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.516
and started asking questions,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.780
I almost automatically mirrored them.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.436
Their questions gave me room to speak,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.836
but they also gave me permission
to ask them questions

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.020
and to truly hear their responses.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.500
It fundamentally changed
the dynamic of our conversation.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.940
The third is stay calm.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.636
This takes practice and patience,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.980
but it's powerful.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.836
At Westboro, I learned not to care
how my manner of speaking affected others.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.916
I thought my rightness
justified my rudeness --

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.676
harsh tones, raised voices,
insults, interruptions --

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.140
but that strategy
is ultimately counterproductive.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.556
Dialing up the volume and the snark
is natural in stressful situations,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.580
but it tends to bring the conversation
to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.676
When my husband was still
just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.556
our discussions frequently
became hard and pointed,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.540
but we always refused to escalate.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.116
Instead, he would change the subject.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.356
He would tell a joke or recommend a book

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.580
or gently excuse himself
from the conversation.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.236
We knew the discussion wasn't over,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.580
just paused for a time
to bring us back to an even keel.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.596
People often lament that digital
communication makes us less civil,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.860
but this is one advantage that online
conversations have over in-person ones.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.116
We have a buffer of time and space

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.460
between us and the people
whose ideas we find so frustrating.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.156
We can use that buffer.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.876
Instead of lashing out,
we can pause, breathe,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.076
change the subject or walk away,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.540
and then come back to it when we're ready.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.220
And finally ...

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.780
make the argument.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.236
This might seem obvious,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.836
but one side effect
of having strong beliefs

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.476
is that we sometimes assume

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.596
that the value of our position
is or should be obvious and self-evident,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.836
that we shouldn't
have to defend our positions

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.956
because they're so clearly right and good

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.556
that if someone doesn't get it,
it's their problem --

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.500
that it's not my job to educate them.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.716
But if it were that simple,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.540
we would all see things the same way.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.636
As kind as my friends on Twitter were,

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.036
if they hadn't actually
made their arguments,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.620
it would've been so much harder for me
to see the world in a different way.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.196
We are all a product of our upbringing,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.740
and our beliefs reflect our experiences.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.900
We can't expect others
to spontaneously change their own minds.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.796
If we want change,

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.540
we have to make the case for it.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.036
My friends on Twitter didn't abandon
their beliefs or their principles --

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.260
only their scorn.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.676
They channeled their
infinitely justifiable offense

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.820
and came to me with pointed questions
tempered with kindness and humor.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.796
They approached me as a human being,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.396
and that was more transformative

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.660
than two full decades
of outrage, disdain and violence.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.356
I know that some might not have
the time or the energy or the patience

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.636
for extensive engagement,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.716
but as difficult as it can be,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.236
reaching out to someone we disagree with

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.540
is an option that is
available to all of us.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.916
And I sincerely believe
that we can do hard things,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.580
not just for them
but for us and our future.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.796
Escalating disgust
and intractable conflict

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.956
are not what we want for ourselves,

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.236
or our country

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.460
or our next generation.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.636
My mom said something to me
a few weeks before I left Westboro,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.076
when I was desperately hoping

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.180
there was a way
I could stay with my family.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.116
People I have loved
with every pulse of my heart

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.476
since even before I was
that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.180
standing on a picket line
holding a sign I couldn't read.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.636
She said, "You're just a human being,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.340
my dear, sweet child."

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.836
She was asking me to be humble --

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.980
not to question
but to trust God and my elders.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.316
But to me, she was missing
the bigger picture --

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.300
that we're all just human beings.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.876
That we should be guided
by that most basic fact,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.116
and approach one another
with generosity and compassion.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.436
Each one of us
contributes to the communities

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.020
and the cultures and the societies
that we make up.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.476
The end of this spiral of rage and blame
begins with one person

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.260
who refuses to indulge
these destructive, seductive impulses.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.756
We just have to decide
that it's going to start with us.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.996
Thank you.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.330
(Applause)
