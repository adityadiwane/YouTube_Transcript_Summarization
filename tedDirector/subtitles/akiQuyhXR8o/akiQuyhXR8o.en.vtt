00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.796
We all have milestones in life
that we remember so vividly.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.436
The first one for me
was when I was entering kindergarten.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.900
My big brother was in school,
and by golly, it was my time.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.076
And I went trottin' down that hallway.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.580
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.916
And I go to the door,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.556
and there was the teacher
with a warm welcome,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.716
and she took me into the classroom,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.316
showed me my little cubbyhole --

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.956
we all remember those
little cubbyholes, don't we --

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.420
and we put our stuff in there.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.036
And then she said, "Go over to the circle

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.340
and play with the kids
until class starts."

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.436
So I went over there
and plopped down like I owned the place,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.876
and I'm playing,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.805
and all of a sudden, the boy next to me,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.876
he was wearing a white shirt
with blue shorts.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.620
I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.316
Suddenly he stopped playing and he said,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.940
"Why are you so short?"

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.636
And I just kept playing.
I didn't think he was talking to me.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.676
(Laughter)

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.516
And in a louder voice, he said,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.820
"Hey, why are you so short?"

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.836
So I looked up and I said,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.556
"What are you talking about?
Let's just play. We're happy.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.940
I've been waiting for this."

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.916
And so we played,
and about a minute later,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.596
the girl next to him,
in a white shirt and a pink skirt,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.356
stood up, put her hands on her hips,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.420
and said, "Yeah,
why do you look so different?"

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.276
And I went, "What are you talking about?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.660
I don't look different. I'm not short.
Again, let's just play."

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.836
About this time, I looked
all around the circle I was in,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.220
and all the kids had stopped playing
and they were all looking at me.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.516
And I'm thinking --

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.316
in today's language,
it would be "OMG" or "WTF."

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.980
(Laughter)

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.900
What just happened?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.676
So all the confidence
that I went in with that morning

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.036
was withering away as the morning went on

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.740
and the questions kept coming.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.996
And at the end of the morning,
before I went home,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.956
the teacher had us in a circle,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.676
and I actually found myself
outside of the circle.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.036
I couldn't look at anybody.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.700
I could not understand what just happened.

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.756
And over the next few years,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.876
I hated to go out in public.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.796
I felt every stare, every giggle,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.476
every pointed finger,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.916
not the finger,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.876
but every pointed finger,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.156
and I hated it.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.100
I would hide behind my parents' legs
like nobody could see me.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.396
And as a child,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.756
you can't understand
another child's curiosity,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.540
nor an adult's ignorance.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.836
It became very apparent to me
that the real world was not built

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.860
for someone of my size,
both literally or figuratively.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.596
And so I have no anonymity,
as you can probably tell,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.356
and while you can see my size,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.876
we all go through many challenges
through our lifetime.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.876
And some you can see, like mine.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.476
Most you can't.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.476
You can't tell if someone's dealing
with a mental illness,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.076
or they're struggling
with their gender identity,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.636
they're caring for an aging parent,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.396
they're having financial difficulty.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.340
You can't see that kind of stuff.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.196
So while you can see

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.036
one of my challenges is my size,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.396
seeing does not mean you understand

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.236
what it's truly to be me on a daily basis,
or what I go through.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.716
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.876
I do not believe you can
walk in someone else's shoes,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.516
and because of that, we must adopt
a new way of giving of ourselves.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.436
Simply stated, I will never know
what it's like to be you

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.276
and you will never know
what it's like to be me.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.076
I cannot face your fears
or chase your dreams,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.956
and you can't do that for me,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.500
but we can be supportive of each other.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.796
Instead of trying to walk
in each other's shoes,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.060
we must adopt a new way
of giving of ourselves.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.116
I learned at an early age

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.996
that I did have to do some things
different than most people,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.476
but I also learned there were things
I was on equal footing with,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.636
and one of those was the classroom.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.620
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.716
As a matter of fact,
I excelled in the classroom.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.315
This was vitally important,
I discovered as I grew older

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.636
and realized I wasn't going to be able
to do a physical job.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.500
I needed an education.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.996
So I went on and got a university degree,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.796
but I felt to be one step ahead
of everyone for employment,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.036
I needed to have
an advanced university degree,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.476
so I went ahead and got that.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.396
Now I'm ready for my interview.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.276
Remember your first interview?
What am I going to wear?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.516
What questions?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.340
And don't forget that firm handshake.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.596
I was right there with you.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.636
So 24 hours before my interview,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.196
a friend of mine
who I've known all my life

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.516
called and said, "Michele,
the building you're going in has steps."

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.716
And she knew I couldn't climb steps.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.596
So suddenly, my focus changed.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.060
In my shoes, I was worried
about how am I going to get there?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.396
So I went early and found a loading dock
and got in and had a great interview.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.380
They had no idea what I went through
for the day and that's OK.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.796
You're probably thinking my greatest
challenge that day was the interview,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.716
or getting in the building.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.356
In reality, my biggest challenge that day

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.285
was getting through the loading dock
without getting run over.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.980
I am very vulnerable
in certain situations:

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.116
airports, hallways, parking lots,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.340
loading docks.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.916
And so I have to be very careful.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.876
I have to anticipate and be flexible

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.220
and move as quickly as I can sometimes.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.516
So I got the job,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.596
and in my current role
I travel quite a bit.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.500
And travel is a challenge
for all of us these days.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.436
And so you probably get to the airport,
run through security, get to the gate.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.140
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?
Did I get my upgrade?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.196
Me, first of all,
I don't run through anything.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.396
(Laughter)

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.476
And I especially don't run through the TSA

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.340
because I get to experience
the personal patdown.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.156
I won't comment on that.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.156
And then I make my way to the gate,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.956
and with my gift of gab
that my parents said I was born with,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.596
I talk to the gate agent, and then I say,
"By the way, my scooter weighs this much,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.236
I have a dry cell battery,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.660
and I can drive it down
to the door of the plane."

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.836
Also, the day before, I had called
the city where I'm traveling to

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.020
to find out where I could rent a scooter
in case mine gets broken on the way.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.660
So in my shoes,
it's a little bit different.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.556
When I get onto the plane,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.020
I use my gift of gab to ask the lady
to put my bag up, and they graciously do.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.356
I try not to eat or drink on a plane

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.276
because I don't want to have to
get up and walk on the plane,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.876
but nature has its own schedule,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.476
and not long ago,
it knocked and I answered.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.876
So I walked up to the front of the plane

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.916
and gabbed with the flight attendant,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.260
and said, "Can you watch the door?
I can't reach the lock."

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.236
So I'm in there doing my business,
and the door flies open.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.820
And there's a gentleman there

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.236
with a look of horror on his face.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.641
I'm sure I had the same look.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.020
As I came out, I noticed
that he was sitting right across from me,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.220
and he's in total, complete embarrassment.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.636
So I walk up to him and I quietly go,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.956
"Are you going to remember this
as much as I am?"

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.660
(Laughter)

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.916
And he goes, "I think so."

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.596
(Laughter)

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.916
Now, while he's probably
not talking about it publicly, I am.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.756
(Laughter)

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.556
But we talked for the rest of the flight,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.476
and we got to know each other,
our families, sports, work,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.196
and when we landed, he said,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.396
"Michele, I noticed
someone put your bag up.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.636
Can I get that for you?"

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.340
And I said, "Of course, thank you."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.396
And we wished each other well,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.316
and the most important thing that day

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.116
was that he was not going to leave
with that embarrassment,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.556
that experience of embarrassment.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.996
He won't forget it, and neither will I,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.276
but I think he will remember more

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.020
our chat and our different perspectives.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.036
When you travel internationally,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.636
it can be even more challenging
in certain ways.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.396
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.036
and I come wheeling in,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.260
and think about that.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.715
Short, white, blond woman in a chair.

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.700
That doesn't probably happen every day.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.756
So I go up, and with my gift of gab,
I start to talk to the agent.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.196
So friendly, and I ask
about their culture and so forth,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.036
and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.996
So I had to kind of say,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.076
"Not only do you have to lift my chair,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.340
I could use some help
getting up the steps."

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.596
So we got to spend about an hour together
while we waited for the flight,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.476
and it was the most magnificent hour.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.956
Our perspective changed
for both of us that day.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.396
And once I got on the flight,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.356
he patted me on the back
and wished me well,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.596
and I thanked him so much.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.076
And again, I think he's going
to remember that experience more

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.660
than when I first came in,
and there was a bit of hesitation.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.676
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.636
I would not be where I am today

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.996
if it was not for my family,
my friends, my colleagues

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.716
and the many strangers

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.020
that help me every single day of my life.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.676
And it's important
that we all have a support system.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.316
Asking for help is a strength,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.556
not a weakness.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.140
(Applause)

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.596
We all need help throughout our lifetime,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.036
but it is just as important

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.476
that we are part
of other people's support systems.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.676
We must adopt that way of giving back.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.580
We all obviously have a role to play
in our own successes,

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.996
but think about the role we have to play
in other people's successes,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.700
just like people do for me
every single day.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.356
It's vitally important
that we help each other,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.700
because society is increasingly
placing people in silos

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.380
based on biases and ideologies.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.940
And we must look past the surface

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.036
and be confronted with the truth

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.916
that none of us are what you can see.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.036
There's more to us than that,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.340
and we're all dealing with things
that you cannot see.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.036
So living a life free of judgment

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.396
allows all of us to share
those experiences together

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.476
and have a totally different perspective,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.180
just like the couple of people
I mentioned earlier in my stories.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.396
So remember, the only shoes

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.900
you truly can walk in are your own.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.500
I cannot walk in yours.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.076
I know you can't walk in my size 1s --

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.196
(Laughter)

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.420
but you can try.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.260
But we can do something better than that.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.596
With compassion,
courage and understanding,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.316
we can walk side by side

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.396
and support one another,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.076
and think about how society can change

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.756
if we all do that

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.220
instead of judging
on only what you can see.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.996
Thank you.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.700
(Applause)

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.100
Thank you.
