00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Have you ever wondered

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
over the course of the last decade?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Have you ever wondered

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
how such a situation can be turned around?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
and thought, "How could we have predicted that?"

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
or "How could we have better prepared for that?"

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Well my personal story, my personal journey,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
what brings me to the TED stage here today,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
I want to share some of that story with you,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
but also some of my ideas around change

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
and the role of social movements in creating change

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
in Muslim-majority societies.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So let me begin

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
by first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
if I may indulge.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
An identity was defined

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
primarily by religion.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
with the rise of a European nation-state

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
where identities and allegiances were defined

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
by ethnicity.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
and the nation-state reflected that.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
In the age of globalization, we moved on.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I call it the era of citizenship --

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
but all be equal as citizens

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
in a state.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
You could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
you could be British-Pakistani.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But I believe now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that we're moving into a new age,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and that age The New York Times dubbed recently

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
as "the age of behavior."

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
How I define the age of behavior

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
is a period of transnational allegiances,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
where identity is defined more so

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
by ideas and narratives.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
are increasingly beginning to affect

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
the way in which people behave.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Now this is not all necessarily good news,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
because it's also my belief

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that hatred has gone global

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
just as much as love.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
But actually it's my belief

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
up until now, up until recent times,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
up until the last six months,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
the people who have been capitalizing most

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
on the age of behavior

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
and the transnational allegiances,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
using digital activism

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
and other sorts of borderless technologies,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
those who've been benefiting from this

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
have been extremists.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
If we look at Islamists,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
if we look at the phenomenon

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
of far-right fascists,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
one thing they've been very good at,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
one thing that they've actually been exceeding in,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
is communicating across borders,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
using technologies to organize themselves,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
to propagate their message

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and to create truly global phenomena.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Now I should know,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
because for 13 years of my life,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.260
I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And I was actually a potent force

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
in spreading ideas across borders,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
as distinct from Islam the faith,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
across the world.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And my story, my personal story,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
is truly evidence for the age of behavior

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
I was, by the way -- I'm an Essex lad,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
born and raised in Essex in the U.K.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Anyone who's from England

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
knows the reputation we have from Essex.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
But having been born in Essex,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
at the age of 16,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I joined an organization.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
to this organization.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
At the age of 19,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
At the age of 22,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
I was co-founding this organization in Denmark.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
By the age of 24,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
being blacklisted from three countries in the world

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
for attempting to overthrow their governments,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
being subjected to torture

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
in Egyptian jails

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Now that journey,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and what took me from Essex all the way across the world --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
We felt that they were out of date.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
I learned how to use email

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
from the extremist organization that I used.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
without being detected.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
But the way in which I learned

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
to use technology to my advantage

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
was because I was within an extremist organization

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
that was forced to think beyond

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
the confines of the nation-state.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
were increasingly defining behavior

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and identity and allegiances.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So as I said, we looked to the status quo

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and ridiculed it.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But even if you look across

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
the mood music in Europe of late,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
far-right fascism is also on the rise.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
A form of anti-Islam rhetoric

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
is also on the rise

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and it's transnational.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
And the consequences that this is having

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
is that it's affecting the political climate

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
across Europe.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
What's actually happening

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
is that what were previously localized parochialisms,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
individual or groupings of extremists

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
who were isolated from one another,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
have become interconnected in a globalized way

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
and have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
Because the Internet and connection technologies

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
are connecting them across the world.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
you will see some things that are happening

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
that are influencing domestic politics,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
yet the phenomenon is transnational.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
In others, headscarves are being banned.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
In others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
as we speak.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
And on the flip side,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
we have transnational Islamist extremists

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
doing the same thing across their own societies.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Now that never would have been possible before.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
They would have felt isolated,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
until these sorts of technologies came around

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and connected them in a way

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Where does that leave democracy aspirants?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Well I believe they're getting left far behind.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And I'll give you an example here at this stage.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
As an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
in hiding currently in Yemen,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
who inspired a Nigerian,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
son of the head of Nigeria's national bank.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
This Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
In the meanwhile,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
the Old mentality with a capital O,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
was represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.260
and this warning fell on deaf ears.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
The Old mentality with a capital O,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
as represented by the nation-state,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
not yet fully into the age of behavior,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
not recognizing the power of transnational social movements,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
got left behind.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
in attacking the United States of America.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Again with the example of the far right:

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
that we find, ironically,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.260
xenophobic nationalists

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
are utilizing the benefits of globalization.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So why are they succeeding?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind?

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And a social movement is comprised, in my view,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
it's comprised of four main characteristics.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
It's comprised of ideas and narratives

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
and symbols and leaders.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I'll talk you through one example,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
and that's the example of Al-Qaeda.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
that's something that comes to your mind immediately.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
If I ask you to think of their narratives --

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
the West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West --

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
these narratives, they come to your mind immediately.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
the idea is the cause that one believes in;

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
and the narrative is the way to sell that cause --

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
the propaganda, if you like, of the cause.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
they come to your mind immediately.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So these symbols and these leaders

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
come to your mind immediately.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
And that's the power of social movements.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.260
They're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
and these symbols and these leaders.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
However,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and I ask you to think

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
of the symbols and the leaders for democracy

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
in Pakistan today,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
you'll be hard pressed

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
to think beyond perhaps

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Which means, by definition,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
that particular leader no longer exists.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
One of the problems we're facing is, in my view,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
that there are no globalized,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
youth-led, grassroots social movements

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
advocating for democratic culture

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
across Muslim-majority societies.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
for democracy across Muslim-majority societies.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
advocating the democratic culture on the ground.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
So that begs the next question.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Why is it that extremist organizations,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
whether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism --

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Islamism meaning those who wish to impose

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
one version of Islam over the rest of society --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
why is it that they are succeeding

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
in organizing in a globalized way,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
whereas those who aspire to democratic culture

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
are falling behind?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And I believe that's for four reasons.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
I believe, number one, it's complacency.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Because those who aspire to democratic culture

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
are in power,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
or have societies

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
that are leading globalized, powerful societies,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
powerful countries.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
And that level of complacency means

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
The second, I believe,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
is political correctness.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
That we have a hesitation

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
in espousing the universality of democratic culture

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
because we are associating that --

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
we associate believing in the universality of our values --

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
with extremists.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
we do say that human rights are universal.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
But actually going out to propagate that view

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
is associated with either neoconservativism

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
or with Islamist extremism.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
To go around saying that I believe

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.260
as a form of political organizing

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
is associated with extremism.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
And the third,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
democratic choice in Muslim-majority societies

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
has been relegated to a political choice,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
meaning political parties

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.260
in many of these societies

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
ask people to vote for them

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
as the democratic party,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
but then the other parties ask them to vote for them

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
as the military party --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
wanting to rule by military dictatorship.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And then you have a third party saying,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy."

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
So democracy has become merely one political choice

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
among many other forms

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
of political choices available in those societies.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
And what happens as a result of this

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
is, when those parties are elected,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and inevitably they fail,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
or inevitably they make political mistakes,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
democracy takes the blame

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
for their political mistakes.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
And then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
Let's bring the military back again."

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
And the fourth reason, I believe,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
What I mean by that is,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
if the world superpower today was a communist,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
it would be much easier for democracy activists

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
to use democracy activism

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
as a form of resistance against colonialism,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
than it is today with the world superpower being America,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
occupying certain lands

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
and also espousing democratic ideals.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
So roughly these four reasons

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
as a civilizational choice,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
not merely as a political choice.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
When talking about those reasons,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
let's break down certain preconceptions.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Is it just about grievances?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Is it just about a lack of education?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Well statistically,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Statistically, they are educated, on average,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
above the education levels

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
of Western society.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Anecdotally, we can demonstrate

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
that if poverty was the only factor,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician --

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
not an ill-educated man.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
International aid and development has been going on for years,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
but extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
has been on the rise.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And what I believe is missing

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
is genuine grassroots activism

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
on the ground,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
in addition to international aid,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
in addition to education, in addition to health.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Not exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
And this is where I believe

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
neoconservatism had it upside-down.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
Neoconservatism had the philosophy

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
that you go in with a supply-led approach

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
to impose democratic values from the top down.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
They've been building civilizational demand for their values

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
on the grassroots,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
to societies that are increasingly asking for

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
a form of Islamism.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
Mass movements in Pakistan

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
have been represented after the Arab uprisings

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
mainly by organizations

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
claiming for some form of theocracy,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
rather than for a democratic uprising.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Because since pre-partition,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And what's needed is a genuine transnational

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
youth-led movement

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that works to actively advocate

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
for the democratic culture --

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
which is necessarily more

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
than just elections.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
But without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.260
Without human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
Without freedom of belief,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
you don't have the right to join organizations.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
So what's needed is those organizations on the ground

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.260
advocating for the democratic culture itself

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
to create the demand on the ground for this culture.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
What that will do

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.260
is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
where currently we have political parties presenting democracy

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260
as merely a political choice in those societies

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
alongside other choices

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
such as military rule and theocracy.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
rather than merely on a political level,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
a level above politics --

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.260
movements that are not political parties,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
but are rather creating this civilizational demand

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
for this democratic culture.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
What we'll have in the end

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
is this ideal that you see on the slide here --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.260
the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
not for a democracy.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
But to get to that stage,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
where democracy builds the fabric of society

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
and the political choices within that fabric,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.260
but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship --

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
i.e. you're voting in a democracy,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
in an existing democracy,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
To get to that stage,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.260
we genuinely need to start building demand

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
in those societies on the ground.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.260
Now to conclude, how does that happen?

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260
Well, Egypt is a good starting point.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
was particularly cathartic for me.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
What happened there was a political coalition

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260
gathered together for a political goal,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
and that was to remove the leader.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
We need to move one step beyond that now.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
We need to see how we can help those societies

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
move from political coalitions,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
loosely based political coalitions,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
to civilizational coalitions

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
that are working for the ideals and narratives

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
of the democratic culture on the ground.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
Because it's not enough to remove a leader

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260
or ruler or dictator.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
That doesn't guarantee that what comes next

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260
will be a society built on democratic values.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
have historically spread across the MENA region,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
the Middle East and North Africa region.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.260
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.260
In the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
it spread across the MENA region as a whole.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
And the aspiration that we have at the moment --

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
as young Arabs are proving today

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.260
and instantly rebranding themselves

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism --

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
is that there is a chance

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
that democratic culture can start in the region

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
But that will require

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
helping these societies transition

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
from having merely political coalitions

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
that advocate for the democratic culture.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
And we've made a start for that in Pakistan

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
with a movement called Khudi,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
And it's with that thought that I'll end.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
And my time is up, and thank you for your time.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.260
(Applause)
