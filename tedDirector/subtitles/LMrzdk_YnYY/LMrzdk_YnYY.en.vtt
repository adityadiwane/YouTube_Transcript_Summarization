00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm here to talk about

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
the wonder and the mystery

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
of conscious minds.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
The wonder is about the fact

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
that we all woke up this morning

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and we had with it

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
the amazing return of our conscious mind.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and a complete sense of our own existence,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
We should, in fact,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.260
because without having this possibility of conscious minds,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
we would have no knowledge whatsoever

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
about our humanity;

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
We would have no pains, but also no joys.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
We would have no access to love

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
or to the ability to create.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
that "he who invented consciousness

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
would have a lot to be blamed for."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
But he also forgot

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
that without consciousness,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
he would have no access to true happiness

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
and even the possibility of transcendence.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
This is a mystery

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
All the way back into early philosophy

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
this has been one mystery

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
that has always resisted elucidation,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
has got major controversies.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And there are actually many people

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
that think we should not even touch it;

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I don't believe that,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
and I think the situation is changing.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
It would be ridiculous to claim

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
that we know how we make consciousness

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
in our brains,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
but we certainly can begin

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
to approach the question,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and we can begin to see the shape of a solution.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
And one more wonder to celebrate

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
is the fact that we have imaging technologies

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.260
that now allow us to go inside the human brain

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
and be able to do, for example,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
what you're seeing right now.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
and which show you, in a living brain,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
the reconstruction of that brain.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
And this is a person who is alive.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
This is not a person

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
that is being studied at autopsy.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
And even more --

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and this is something that one can be really amazed about --

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
is what I'm going to show you next,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
which is going underneath the surface of the brain

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
and actually looking in the living brain

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
at real connections, real pathways.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
So all of those colored lines

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
correspond to bunches of axons,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
the fibers that join cell bodies

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
to synapses.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
And I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
But at any rate, they are there.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
The colors are codes for the direction,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
from whether it is back to front

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
or vice versa.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
At any rate, what is consciousness?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
What is a conscious mind?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And we could take a very simple view

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
and say, well, it is that which we lose

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
when we fall into deep sleep without dreams,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
or when we go under anesthesia,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and it is what we regain

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
when we recover from sleep

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
or from anesthesia.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.260
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Well first of all,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
it is a mind,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
which is a flow of mental images.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And of course consider images

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
that can be sensory patterns,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
visual, such as you're having right now

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
in relation to the stage and me,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
or auditory images,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
as you are having now in relation to my words.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
That flow of mental images

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
is mind.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
But there is something else

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that we are all experiencing in this room.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
We are not passive exhibitors

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
of visual or auditory

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
or tactile images.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
We have selves.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
We have a Me

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that is automatically present

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
in our minds right now.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
We own our minds.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
that is experiencing this --

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
not the person who is sitting next to you.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
So in order to have a conscious mind,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
you have a self within the conscious mind.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
and we are only fully conscious

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
when self comes to mind.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So what we need to know to even address this mystery

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and, number two, how selves are constructed.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Now the first part, the first problem,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
is relatively easy -- it's not easy at all --

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.260
but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
we need to construct neural maps.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and now imagine, within that grid,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
that two-dimensional sheet,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
imagine neurons.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
And picture, if you will,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
a billboard, a digital billboard,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
where you have elements

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
that can be either lit or not.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And depending on how you create the pattern

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
of lighting or not lighting,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the digital elements,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
you're going to be able to construct a map.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
but this applies to any kind of map --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
or to the maps that we construct with our skin

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
in relation to an object that we palpate.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
Now to bring home the point

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
of how close it is --

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
the relationship between the grid of neurons

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
and the topographical arrangement

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
of the activity of the neurons

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and our mental experience --

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
I'm going to tell you a personal story.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
So if I cover my left eye --

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
I'm talking about me personally, not all of you --

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
if I cover my left eye,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
But sometime ago, I discovered

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
that if I cover my left eye,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
instead what I get is this.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I look at the grid and I see a warping

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
at the edge of my central-left field.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
But sometime ago,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
Carmen Puliafito,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
who developed a laser scanner of the retina,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
I found out the the following.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
If I scan my retina

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
what I get is the following.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.260
You see the going down towards the fovea

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
where the optic nerve begins.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
But on my left retina there is a bump,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
which is marked there by the red arrow.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And it corresponds to a little cyst

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
that is located below.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
And that is exactly what causes

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.260
the warping of my visual image.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
So just think of this:

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
you have a grid of neurons,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and now you have a plane mechanical change

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
in the position of the grid,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
and you get a warping of your mental experience.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
So this is how close

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
your mental experience

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and the activity of the neurons in the retina,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
So from the retina

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
you go onto visual cortex.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And of course, the brain adds on

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
a lot of information

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
to what is going on

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
in the signals that come from the retina.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And in that image there,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
you see a variety of islands

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
of what I call image-making regions in the brain.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
You have the green for example,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
that corresponds to tactile information,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
or the blue that corresponds to auditory information.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And something else that happens

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
is that those image-making regions

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
where you have the plotting

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
of all these neural maps,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
can then provide signals

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
to this ocean of purple that you see around,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
which is the association cortex,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
where you can make records of what went on

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
in those islands of image-making.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And the great beauty

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is that you can then go from memory,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
out of those association cortices,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and produce back images

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in the very same regions that have perception.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
the brain is.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
So it provides certain areas

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
for perception and image-making.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
And those are exactly the same

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
that are going to be used for image-making

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
when we recall information.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
So far the mystery of the conscious mind

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
is diminishing a little bit

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
because we have a general sense

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
of how we make these images.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
But what about the self?

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
The self is really the elusive problem.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
And for a long time,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
people did not even want to touch it,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
because they'd say,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
"How can you have this reference point, this stability,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that is required to maintain

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
the continuity of selves day after day?"

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
And I thought about a solution to this problem.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
It's the following.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
We generate brain maps

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
of the body's interior

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
and use them as the reference for all other maps.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
I came to this because,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
if you're going to have a reference that we know as self --

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
the Me, the I

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
in our own processing --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
we need to have something that is stable,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
something that does not deviate much

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
from day to day.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
Well it so happens that we have a singular body.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
We have one body, not two, not three.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And so that is a beginning.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
There is just one reference point, which is the body.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
But then, of course, the body has many parts,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
and things grow at different rates,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
and they have different sizes and different people;

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
however, not so with the interior.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
The things that have to do

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
with what is known as our internal milieu --

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
for example, the whole management

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
of the chemistries within our body

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
are, in fact, extremely maintained

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
day after day

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
for one very good reason.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
If you deviate too much

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
in the parameters

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that are close to the midline

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
of that life-permitting survival range,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
you go into disease or death.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
So we have an in-built system

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
within our own lives

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
that ensures some kind of continuity.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
you're going to be sick or you're going to die.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
So that's one more element for this continuity.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
And the final thing

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
is that there is a very tight coupling

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
between the regulation of our body within the brain

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
and the body itself,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
unlike any other coupling.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
So for example, I'm making images of you,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
but there's no physiological bond

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
between the images I have of you as an audience

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
and my brain.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.260
However, there is a close, permanently maintained bond

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
between the body regulating parts of my brain

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
and my own body.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So here's how it looks. Look at the region there.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
and the spinal cord.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
And it is within that region

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
that I'm going to highlight now

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
that we have this housing

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
of all the life-regulation devices

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
of the body.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
This is so specific that, for example,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.260
if you look at the part that is covered in red

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
in the upper part of the brain stem,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
what you get is coma

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
or vegetative state,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
which is a state, of course,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
in which your mind disappears,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
your consciousness disappears.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
What happens then actually

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
is that you lose the grounding of the self,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and, in fact, there can be images going on,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
being formed in the cerebral cortex,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
except you don't know they're there.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
You have, in effect, lost consciousness

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.260
when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
nothing like that happens.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
It is that specific.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
So in that green component of the brain stem,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
if you damage it, and often it happens,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
what you get is complete paralysis,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
but your conscious mind is maintained.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
that you can report very indirectly.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And people are, in fact, imprisoned

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
within their own bodies,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
but they do have a mind.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
There was a very interesting film,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
one of the rare good films done

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
about a situation like this,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
by Julian Schnabel some years ago

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
about a patient that was in that condition.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
So now I'm going to show you a picture.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
I promise not to say anything about this,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
except this is to frighten you.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
It's just to tell you

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
that in that red section of the brain stem,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
there are, to make it simple,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
all those little squares that correspond to modules

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.260
that actually make brain maps

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
of different aspects of our interior,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
different aspects of our body.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
They are exquisitely topographic

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and they are exquisitely interconnected

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
in a recursive pattern.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
between the brain stem and the body

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
that I believe -- and I could be wrong,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
but I don't think I am --

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
that you generate this mapping of the body

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
that provides the grounding for the self

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
and that comes in the form of feelings --

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
primordial feelings, by the way.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
So what is the picture that we get here?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Look at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
look at "body,"

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and you get the picture of the interconnectivity

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.260
in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
in a very tight interconnection with the body.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
And you have the cerebral cortex

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
providing the great spectacle of our minds

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
with the profusion of images

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
that are, in fact, the contents of our minds

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
and that we normally pay most attention to,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
as we should, because that's really

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
the film that is rolling in our minds.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
But look at the arrows.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
They're not there for looks.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
They're there because there's this very close interaction.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
if you don't have the interaction

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
between cerebral cortex and brain stem.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
if you don't have the interaction

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
between the brain stem and the body.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Another thing that is interesting

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
is that the brain stem that we have

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
is shared with a variety of other species.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
So throughout vertebrates,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
which is one of the reasons why I think

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
those other species have conscious minds like we do.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
Except that they're not as rich as ours,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
That's where the difference is.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And I strongly disagree with the idea

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
that consciousness should be considered

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260
as the great product of the cerebral cortex.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
Only the wealth of our minds is,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
not the very fact that we have a self

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
that we can refer

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
to our own existence,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.260
and that we have any sense of person.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
Now there are three levels of self to consider --

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
the proto, the core and the autobiographical.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
The first two are shared

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
with many, many other species,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
and they are really coming out

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
largely of the brain stem

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.260
and whatever there is of cortex in those species.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
It's the autobiographical self

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
which some species have, I think.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
Cetaceans and primates have also

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
And everybody's dogs at home

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.260
But the novelty is here.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
The autobiographical self is built

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
on the basis of past memories

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260
and memories of the plans that we have made;

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
it's the lived past and the anticipated future.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
And the autobiographical self

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
has prompted extended memory, reasoning,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
imagination, creativity and language.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
And out of that came the instruments of culture --

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
religions, justice,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
trade, the arts, science, technology.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
And it is within that culture

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
that we really can get --

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and this is the novelty --

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.260
something that is not entirely set by our biology.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
It is developed in the cultures.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.260
It developed in collectives of human beings.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
And this is, of course, the culture

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
where we have developed something that I like to call

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
socio-cultural regulation.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
And finally, you could rightly ask,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
why care about this?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
and how this is made?

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
Three reasons. First, curiosity.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Primates are extremely curious --

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
and humans most of all.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
And if we are interested, for example,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
in the fact that anti-gravity

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
is pulling galaxies away from the Earth,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
why should we not be interested in what is going on

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.260
inside of human beings?

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
Second, understanding society and culture.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
We should look

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260
at how society and culture

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
in this socio-cultural regulation

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
are a work in progress.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
And finally, medicine.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.260
of humankind

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.260
are diseases such as depression,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.260
Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
or render you unconscious.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
You have no prayer

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
of treating those diseases effectively

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
and in a non-serendipitous way

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
if you do not know how this works.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
So that's a very good reason

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
beyond curiosity

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
to justify what we're doing,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
Thank you for your attention.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.260
