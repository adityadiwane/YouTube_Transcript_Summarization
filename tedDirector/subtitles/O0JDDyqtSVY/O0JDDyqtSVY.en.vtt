00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.586
Let's begin with a story.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.537
Once upon a time --

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:24.603
well actually less than two years ago --

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:27.636
in a kingdom not so very far away,

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.387
there was a man

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:31.254
who traveled many miles

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:34.836
to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown --

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:37.420
an internationally famous company.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.538
Let's call it Island Networks.

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:43.386
Now this kingdom had many resources

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.603
and mighty ambitions,

00:00:45.603 --> 00:00:48.170
but the one thing it lacked was people.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.603
And so it invited workers from around the world

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:54.253
to come and help it build the nation.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:57.220
But in order to enter and to stay

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.755
these migrants had to pass a few tests.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.238
And so it was, our man presented himself

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:05.007
to authorities in the kingdom,

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.205
looking forward to settling into his new life.

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:11.455
But then something unexpected happened.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:15.055
The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:18.738
never actually told him what they were testing for.

00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:23.007
He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.338
which is best medical practice.

00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:28.339
He was never informed of the results of the test.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.455
And yet, a couple of weeks later,

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:33.489
he was picked up and taken to prison

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.023
where he was subjected to a medical exam,

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.774
including a full-body search

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:42.372
in full view of the others in the cell.

00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:46.139
He was released, but then a day or two later,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:51.108
he was taken to the airport and he was deported.

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:54.373
What on earth did this man do

00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:56.523
to merit this treatment?

00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:59.125
What was his terrible crime?

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.773
He was infected with HIV.

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:05.904
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:10.176
that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:12.776
of people living with HIV.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:14.377
The kingdom argues

00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:19.577
that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:22.276
who pose a risk to the economy

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:25.776
or the security or the public health

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.893
or the morals of the state.

00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:31.726
But these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:35.108
are a violation of international human rights agreements

00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:38.328
to which these countries are signatories.

00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:39.576
But you know what?

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.059
Matters of principle aside,

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:46.044
practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:48.642
People are less likely to come forth

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:52.676
to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:55.508
none of which helps these individuals

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:59.677
or the communities these laws purport to protect.

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:03.742
Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:07.161
And with treatment, it is a manageable condition.

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.992
We are very far from the days

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:13.178
when the only practical response to dread disease

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:15.758
was to have banished the afflicted --

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.660
like this, "The Exile of the Leper."

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.877
So you tell me why, in our age of science,

00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:24.443
we still have laws and policies

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:27.726
which come from an age of superstition.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.993
Time for a quick show of hands.

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:34.258
Who here has been touched by HIV --

00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:37.342
either because you yourself have the virus

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.827
or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:42.860
who is living with HIV?

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.960
Hands up.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.941
Wow. Wow.

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.860
That's a significant number of us.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.392
You know better than anyone

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:53.659
that HIV brings out

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.242
the best and the worst in humanity.

00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:59.962
And the laws reflect these attitudes.

00:03:59.962 --> 00:04:02.642
I'm not just talking about laws on the books,

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:06.009
but laws as they are enforced on the streets

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.942
and laws as they are decided in the courts.

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:11.492
And I'm not just talking about laws

00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:13.861
as they relate to people living with HIV,

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:17.092
but people who are at greatest risk of infection --

00:04:17.092 --> 00:04:20.860
people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.009
or men who have sex with men

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.892
or transgendered persons

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:27.360
or migrants or prisoners.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.910
And in many parts of the world that includes women and children

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.941
who are especially vulnerable.

00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:35.743
Now there are laws in many parts of the world

00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:39.175
which reflect the best of human nature.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:42.461
These laws treat people touched by HIV

00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.360
with compassion and acceptance.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.759
These laws respect universal human rights

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.443
and they are grounded in evidence.

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:54.576
These laws ensure that people living with HIV

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:56.692
and those at greatest risk

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:00.276
are protected from violence and discrimination

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:04.492
and that they get access to prevention and to treatment.

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:07.288
Unfortunately, these good laws

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:09.424
are counter-balanced by a mass

00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:12.425
of really bad law --

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:16.874
law which is grounded in moral judgement

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:19.727
and in fear and in misinformation,

00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:23.826
laws which specifically punish people living with HIV

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:25.458
or those at greatest risk.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.225
These laws fly in the face of science,

00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:31.508
and they are grounded in prejudice

00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:35.326
and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:38.608
and a selective reading of religion.

00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:41.225
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.109
We're going to hear from two people

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.642
who are on the sharp end of the law.

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:47.843
The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.

00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:51.841
And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law

00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:54.726
on HIV transmission and exposure --

00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:58.178
neither of which offense he actually committed.

00:05:58.178 --> 00:06:01.376
(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:02.575
then that is telling society

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:05.176
that is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:07.746
And I think the severity of that punishment

00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:11.435
tells you how bad you are as a person.

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:13.925
You're a class B felon,

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:16.709
lifetime sex offender.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:20.742
You are a very, very, very bad person.

00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:24.129
And you did a very, very, very bad thing.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.684
And so that's just programmed into you.

00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:29.917
And you go through the correctional system

00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:31.718
and everyone's telling you the same thing.

00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:36.682
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person.

00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:38.647
Shereen El-Feki: It's not just a question

00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:41.746
of unfair or ineffective laws.

00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:43.847
Some countries have good laws,

00:06:43.847 --> 00:06:46.497
laws which could stem the tide of HIV.

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:49.597
The problem is that these laws are flouted.

00:06:49.597 --> 00:06:52.564
Because stigma gives unofficial license

00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:54.881
to treat people living with HIV

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.197
or those at greatest risk

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:58.531
unlike other citizens.

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.230
And this is exactly what happened

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.444
to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.

00:07:03.444 --> 00:07:05.171
(Video) Hilma: I found out

00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:08.085
when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:11.768
The nurse announced that every pregnant woman

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:13.863
must also be tested for HIV that day.

00:07:13.863 --> 00:07:16.912
I took the test and the result showed I was positive.

00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:19.508
That's the day I found out.

00:07:19.508 --> 00:07:22.120
The nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.648
when you know you are HIV positive?

00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:26.043
Why are you pregnant when you are living positive?"

00:07:26.043 --> 00:07:29.032
I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:34.164
Because I am HIV positive.

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:37.195
They didn't give the forms to me

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.932
or explain what was in the form.

00:07:40.932 --> 00:07:43.332
The nurse just came with it

00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:45.414
already marked where I had to sign.

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:47.358
And with the labor pain,

00:07:47.358 --> 00:07:54.428
I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.

00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:56.957
I just signed.

00:07:56.972 --> 00:08:00.110
SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.461
are among the 34 million people living with HIV

00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.577
according to recent estimates.

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.445
They're the lucky ones

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:10.129
because they're still alive.

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:11.994
According to those same estimates,

00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:15.978
in 2010 1.8 million people died

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:18.377
of AIDS related causes.

00:08:18.377 --> 00:08:21.880
These are terrible and tragic figures.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.311
But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,

00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:29.512
we actually see some reason for hope.

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:34.912
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.

00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:37.363
And looking globally as well,

00:08:37.363 --> 00:08:40.729
deaths are also starting to fall.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.762
There are many reasons for these positive developments,

00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:44.895
but one of the most remarkable

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:48.062
is in the increase in the number of people around the world

00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:50.245
on anti-retroviral therapy,

00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:54.378
the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.

00:08:54.378 --> 00:08:56.411
Now there are still many problems.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.761
Only about half of the people who need treatment

00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:01.994
are currently receiving it.

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:03.846
In some parts of the world --

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:06.195
like here in the Middle East and North Africa --

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:09.578
new infections are rising and so are deaths.

00:09:09.578 --> 00:09:12.729
And the money, the money we need

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:14.662
for the global response to HIV,

00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:17.658
that is shrinking.

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.947
But for the first time

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:23.165
in three decades into this epidemic

00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:27.282
we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.248
But in order to do that

00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:33.147
we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.

00:09:33.147 --> 00:09:34.765
It's for this reason

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.895
that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,

00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:38.194
of which I'm a member,

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:41.260
was established by the agencies of the United Nations --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.910
to look at the ways that legal environments

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.927
are affecting people living with HIV

00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:48.061
and those at greatest risk,

00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:49.811
and to recommend what should be done

00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:53.047
to make the law an ally, not an enemy,

00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:55.779
of the global response to HIV.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:58.128
Let me give you just one example

00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:00.778
of the way a legal environment

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:03.344
can make a positive difference.

00:10:03.344 --> 00:10:06.159
People who inject drugs

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.974
are one of those groups I mentioned.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.095
They're at high risk of HIV

00:10:10.095 --> 00:10:11.960
through contaminated injection equipment

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.642
and other risk-related behaviors.

00:10:14.642 --> 00:10:18.324
In fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV

00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:21.058
is among people who inject drugs.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:23.659
Now drug use or possession

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:25.808
is illegal in almost every country.

00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:30.058
But some countries take a harder line on this than others.

00:10:30.058 --> 00:10:32.742
In Thailand people who use drugs,

00:10:32.742 --> 00:10:35.593
or are merely suspected of using drugs,

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.459
are placed in detention centers,

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:39.376
like the one you see here,

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:41.459
where they are supposed to clean up.

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:44.391
There is absolutely no evidence

00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:47.242
to show that throwing people into detention

00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:49.575
cures their drug dependence.

00:10:49.575 --> 00:10:51.742
There is, however, ample evidence

00:10:51.742 --> 00:10:53.742
to show that incarcerating people

00:10:53.742 --> 00:10:58.960
increases their risk of HIV and other infections.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.610
We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.375
in people who inject drugs.

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.506
It's called harm reduction,

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:10.290
and it involves, among other things,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.421
providing clean needles and syringes,

00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:16.256
offering opioid substitution therapy

00:11:16.256 --> 00:11:18.522
and other evidence-based treatments

00:11:18.522 --> 00:11:20.772
to reduce drug dependence.

00:11:20.772 --> 00:11:23.289
It involves providing information

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:25.307
and education and condoms

00:11:25.307 --> 00:11:28.438
to reduce HIV transmission,

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.955
and also providing HIV testing

00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:32.788
and counseling and treatment

00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.606
should people become infected.

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:38.139
Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:40.393
the results are striking.

00:11:40.393 --> 00:11:42.223
Australia and Switzerland

00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:44.824
were two countries which introduced harm reduction

00:11:44.824 --> 00:11:47.524
very early on in their HIV epidemics,

00:11:47.524 --> 00:11:50.543
and they have a very low rate of HIV

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.706
among injecting drug users.

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:55.057
The U.S. and Malaysia

00:11:55.057 --> 00:11:57.607
came to harm reduction a little later,

00:11:57.607 --> 00:12:01.574
and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:03.257
Thailand and Russia, however,

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:05.159
have resisted harm reduction

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.891
and have stringent laws

00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:08.457
which punish drug use.

00:12:08.457 --> 00:12:09.957
And hey, surprise,

00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:15.324
very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.

00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:18.190
At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.941
and we've heard the experiences

00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:24.274
of over 700 people from 140 countries.

00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:26.532
And the trend? Well the trend is clear.

00:12:26.532 --> 00:12:29.857
Where you criminalize people living with HIV

00:12:29.857 --> 00:12:31.223
or those at greatest risk,

00:12:31.223 --> 00:12:33.972
you fuel the epidemic.

00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:38.241
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV

00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:39.442
or a cure for AIDS --

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:41.940
now that's rocket science.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.723
But changing the law isn't.

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:46.436
And in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:48.019
on a number of points.

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:52.057
To begin, countries need to review their legislation

00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:55.589
as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.

00:12:55.589 --> 00:12:57.706
On the back of those reviews,

00:12:57.706 --> 00:12:59.672
governments should repeal laws

00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:02.840
that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.057
or those at greatest risk.

00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:07.573
Repealing a law isn't easy,

00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:09.357
and it's particularly difficult

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:13.640
when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.207
But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.

00:13:17.207 --> 00:13:21.506
One of the key points is to reform the police

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:24.323
so that they have better practices on the ground.

00:13:24.323 --> 00:13:26.078
So for example, outreach workers

00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:29.078
who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations

00:13:29.078 --> 00:13:32.194
are not themselves subject to police harassment

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:35.144
or abuse or arbitrary arrest.

00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:36.645
We can also train judges

00:13:36.645 --> 00:13:39.812
so that they find flexibilities in the law

00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:42.962
and so that they rule on the side of tolerance

00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:44.861
rather than prejudice.

00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:46.379
We can retool prisons

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:49.744
so that HIV prevention and harm reduction

00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:51.964
is available to prisoners.

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:56.479
The key to all this is reinforcing civil society.

00:13:56.479 --> 00:13:58.162
Because civil society is key

00:13:58.162 --> 00:14:01.028
to raising awareness among vulnerable groups

00:14:01.028 --> 00:14:02.812
of their legal rights.

00:14:02.812 --> 00:14:04.429
But awareness needs action.

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:05.895
And so we need to ensure

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:08.228
that these people who are living with HIV

00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:09.895
or at greatest risk of HIV

00:14:09.895 --> 00:14:12.629
have access to legal services

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:15.545
and they have equal access to the courts.

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:18.246
And also important is talking to communities

00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:20.395
so that we change interpretations

00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:22.895
of religious or customary law,

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.713
which is too often used

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.196
to justify punishment and fuel stigma.

00:14:28.196 --> 00:14:29.444
For many of us here

00:14:29.444 --> 00:14:32.963
HIV is not an abstract threat.

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:35.462
It hits very close to home.

00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:37.979
The law, on the other hand,

00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:42.412
can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,

00:14:42.412 --> 00:14:44.494
but it isn't.

00:14:44.494 --> 00:14:47.379
Because for those of us who live in democracies,

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:49.695
or in aspiring democracies,

00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:52.712
the law begins with us.

00:14:52.712 --> 00:14:55.645
Laws that treat people living with HIV

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.313
or those at greatest risk with respect

00:14:58.313 --> 00:15:03.161
start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.

00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:07.795
If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,

00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:11.462
then that is the change we need to spread.

00:15:11.462 --> 00:15:12.861
Thank you.

00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:20.695
(Applause)
