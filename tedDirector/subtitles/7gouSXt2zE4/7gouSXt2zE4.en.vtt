00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:18.363
This is the ocean as I used to know it.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:23.298
And I find that since I've been
in the Gulf a couple of times,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:27.822
I really kind of am traumatized
because whenever I look at the ocean now,

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.307
no matter where I am,

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:34.236
even where I know
that none of the oil has gone,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.236
I sort of see slicks,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.507
and I'm finding that I'm very much
haunted by it.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.122
But what I want to talk to you about today

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:47.676
is a lot of things that try
to put all of this in context,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.674
not just about the oil eruption,
but what it means and why it has happened.

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:55.333
First, just a little bit about me.

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:57.869
I'm basically just a guy
that likes to go fishing

00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:00.849
ever since I was a little kid,
and because I did,

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:02.940
I wound up studying sea birds

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:06.386
to try to stay in the coastal habitats
that I so loved.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.996
And now I mainly write books
about how the ocean is changing,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.920
and the ocean is certainly
changing very rapidly.

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:19.757
Now we saw this graphic earlier on,
that we really live on a hard marble

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:23.236
that has just a slight bit
of wetness to it.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.502
It's like you dipped a marble in water.

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:27.593
And the same thing with the atmosphere:

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:30.842
If you took all the atmosphere
and rolled it up in a ball,

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.784
you would get that little sphere
of gas on the right.

00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:39.037
So we live on the most fragile
little soap bubble you can imagine,

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.824
a very sacred soap bubble,
but one that is very, very easy to affect.

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:48.695
And all the burning of oil and coal
and gas, all the fossil fuels,

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.888
have changed the atmosphere greatly.

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:53.833
Carbon dioxide level
has gone up and up and up.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.174
We're warming the climate.

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.209
So the blowout in the Gulf

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:02.378
is just a little piece
of a much larger problem

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:06.476
that we have with the energy
that we use to run civilization.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.931
Beyond warming,

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.649
we have the problem
of the oceans getting more acidified --

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.815
and already measurably so,
and already affecting animals.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.888
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam
and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,

00:02:22.912 --> 00:02:26.639
which is the normal pH
of seawater, but 7.5,

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:29.269
it dissolves in about three days.

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:33.088
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:37.404
put it in a pH of 7.7 --
not a huge change --

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:40.081
it becomes deformed and dies.

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:46.947
Already, commercial oyster larvae
are dying at large scales in some places.

00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:51.842
Coral reefs are growing slower
in some places because of this problem.

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.478
So this really matters.

00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:57.859
Now, let's take a little tour
around the Gulf a little bit.

00:02:57.883 --> 00:03:01.272
One of the things that really impresses me
about the people in the Gulf:

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:03.584
They are really, really aquatic people.

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:05.236
And they can handle water.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.892
They can handle a hurricane
that comes and goes.

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:10.236
When the water goes down,
they know what to do.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.016
But when it's something other than water,
and their water habitat changes,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.689
they don't have many options.

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:20.771
In fact, those entire communities
really don't have many options.

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:23.431
They don't have another thing they can do.

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:27.528
They can't go and work
in the local hotel business

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:30.260
because there isn't one
in their community.

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:36.240
If you go to the Gulf and you look around,
you do see a lot of oil.

00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:38.113
You see a lot of oil on the ocean.

00:03:38.137 --> 00:03:40.236
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.236
If you go to the site of the blowout,
it looks pretty unbelievable.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.236
It looks like you just emptied
the oil pan in your car,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.531
and you just dumped it in the ocean.

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.420
And one of the really
most incredible things, I think,

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:56.016
is that there's nobody out there
trying to collect it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.843
at the site where it is densest.

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:03.692
Parts of the ocean there
look just absolutely apocalyptic.

00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:09.222
You go in along the shore,
you can find it everywhere.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.472
It's really messy.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.867
If you go to the places
where it's just arriving,

00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:16.326
like the eastern part
of the Gulf, in Alabama,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.236
there's still people using the beach

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.403
while there are people
cleaning up the beach.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.149
And they have a very strange
way of cleaning up the beach.

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.832
They're not allowed to put
more than 10 pounds of sand

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.564
in a 50-gallon plastic bag.

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:29.944
They have thousands
and thousands of plastic bags.

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.258
I don't know what they'll do
with all that stuff.

00:04:32.282 --> 00:04:35.003
Meanwhile, there are still
people trying to use the beach.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:37.805
They don't see the sign
that says: "Stay out of the water."

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.258
Their kids are in the water;

00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:42.211
they're getting tar all over
their clothes and their sandals--

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:43.446
It's a mess.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.974
If you go to where the oil has been
for a while, it's an even bigger mess.

00:04:46.998 --> 00:04:49.382
And there's basically
nobody there anymore,

00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:52.272
a few people trying to keep using it.

00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.356
You see people who are really
shell-shocked.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.369
They are very hardworking people.

00:04:57.393 --> 00:05:00.003
All they know about life
is they get up in the morning,

00:05:00.027 --> 00:05:02.323
and if their engine starts,
they go to work.

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:06.636
They always felt that
they could rely on the assurances

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.950
that nature brought them
through the ecosystem of the Gulf.

00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:12.766
They're finding that their world
is really collapsing.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.676
And so you can see, literally,
signs of their shock ...

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.736
signs of their outrage ...

00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:27.699
signs of their anger ...

00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:35.025
and signs of their grief.

00:05:36.094 --> 00:05:38.363
These are the things that you can see.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.869
There's a lot you can't see,
also, underwater.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.755
What's going on underwater?

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.388
Well, some people say
there are oil plumes.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:53.236
Some people say there are not oil plumes.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.434
And Congressman Markey asks, you know,

00:05:56.458 --> 00:06:01.415
"Is it going to take a submarine ride
to see if there are really oil plumes?"

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:03.898
But I couldn't take a submarine ride --

00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:08.011
especially between the time I knew
I was coming here and today --

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.236
so I had to do a little experiment myself

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.646
to see if there was oil
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.325
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ...

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:18.243
sparkling place full of fish.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.364
And I created a little oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.834
And I learned, in fact,
I confirmed the hypothesis

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:28.060
that oil and water don't mix ...

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.870
until you add a dispersant ...

00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:34.545
and then ...

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.582
they start mixing.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.890
And you add a little energy
from the wind and the waves,

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:46.209
and you get a big mess,

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:49.368
a big mess that you can't possibly clean,

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:52.413
you can't touch, you can't extract

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:55.702
and, I think most importantly --
this is what I think --

00:06:55.726 --> 00:06:57.236
you can't see it.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.594
I think it's being hidden on purpose.

00:07:00.618 --> 00:07:03.236
Now this is such a catastrophe
and such a mess

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.930
that lots of stuff is leaking out
on the edges of the information stream.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:08.611
But as many people have said,

00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:11.745
there's a large attempt
to suppress what's going on.

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:18.741
Personally, I think that the dispersants
are a major strategy to hide the body,

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:21.904
because we put the murderer
in charge of the crime scene.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.236
But you can see it.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.448
You can see where the oil
is concentrated at the surface,

00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:31.103
and then it is attacked,

00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:34.083
because they don't want
the evidence, in my opinion.

00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:35.787
OK.

00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:38.368
We heard that bacteria eat oil?

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:40.236
So do sea turtles.

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:42.193
When it breaks up,

00:07:42.217 --> 00:07:45.691
it has a long way to go
before it gets down to bacteria.

00:07:46.156 --> 00:07:49.236
Turtles eat it.
It gets in the gills of fish.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.517
These guys have to swim around through it.

00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:56.378
I heard the most incredible story today
when I was on the train coming here.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.236
A writer named Ted Williams called me,

00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:02.667
and he was asking me
a couple of questions about what I saw,

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.834
because he's writing an article
for Audubon magazine.

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:09.605
He said that he had been in the Gulf
a little while ago; like about a week ago,

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:13.543
and a guy who had
been a recreational fishing guide

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:16.236
took him out to show him what's going on.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.236
That guide's entire calendar year
is canceled bookings.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.173
He has no bookings left.

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:26.236
Everybody wanted their deposit back,
everybody is fleeing.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.227
That's the story of thousands of people.

00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:33.329
But he told Ted
that on the last day he went out,

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:37.607
a bottlenose dolphin
suddenly appeared next to the boat,

00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:41.747
and it was splattering oil
out its blowhole.

00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:47.913
And he moved away
because it was his last fishing trip,

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:51.236
and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.144
So he moved away from it,
turned around a few minutes later,

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.415
it was right next to the side
of the boat again.

00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:00.860
He said that in 30 years of fishing
he had never seen a dolphin do that.

00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:02.445
And he felt that --

00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:04.156
(Sigh)

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.841
he felt that it was
coming to ask for help.

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:09.348
Sorry.

00:09:10.652 --> 00:09:14.606
Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.874
about 30 percent of the killer whales
died in the first few months.

00:09:19.898 --> 00:09:21.818
Their numbers have never recovered.

00:09:21.842 --> 00:09:26.707
So the recovery rate of all this stuff
is going to be variable.

00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:29.556
It's going to take longer for some things.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.168
And some things, I think,
will probably come back a little faster.

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:36.236
The other thing about the Gulf
that is important

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.725
is that there are a lot of animals
that concentrate in the Gulf

00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:42.285
at certain parts of the year.

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.689
So the Gulf is a really
important piece of water --

00:09:45.713 --> 00:09:50.623
more important than a similar volume
of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.236
These tuna swim the entire ocean.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.033
They get in the Gulf Stream,
they go all the way to Europe.

00:09:56.057 --> 00:09:58.225
When it comes time to spawn,
they come inside,

00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.974
and these two tuna that were tagged,

00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:02.098
you can see them on the spawning grounds

00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:04.827
very much right in the area of the slick.

00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.336
They're probably having,
at the very least,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.113
a catastrophic spawning season this year.

00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:13.631
I'm hoping that maybe the adults
are avoiding that dirty water.

00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:18.019
They don't usually like to go into water
that is very cloudy anyway.

00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:22.200
But these are really
high-performance athletic animals.

00:10:22.224 --> 00:10:25.466
I don't know what this kind of stuff
will do in their gills.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.436
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.277
If it's not, it's certainly affecting
their eggs and larvae,

00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:31.488
I would certainly think.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:34.855
But if you look at that graph
that goes down and down and down,

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:39.600
that's what we've done to this species
through overfishing over many decades.

00:10:39.624 --> 00:10:44.781
So while the oil spill, the leak,
the eruption, is a catastrophe,

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:47.538
I think it's important to keep in mind

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:51.678
that we've done a lot to affect
what's in the ocean, for a very long time.

00:10:51.702 --> 00:10:55.040
It's not like we're starting
with something that's been OK.

00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:57.800
We're starting with something
that's had a lot of stresses

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.686
and a lot of problems to begin with.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.736
If you look around at the birds,
there are a lot of birds in the Gulf

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.527
that concentrate in the Gulf
at certain times of the year,

00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:07.835
but then leave.

00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:10.931
And they populate much larger areas.

00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:16.837
For instance, most of the birds
in this picture are migratory birds.

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:18.703
They were all on the Gulf in May,

00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:21.844
while oil was starting
to come ashore in certain places.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:26.423
Down on the lower left there
are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:28.170
They breed in the High Arctic,

00:11:28.194 --> 00:11:30.756
and they winter
down in southern South America.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.591
But they concentrate in the Gulf
and then fan out all across the Arctic.

00:11:35.615 --> 00:11:38.741
I saw birds that breed
in Greenland, in the Gulf.

00:11:40.112 --> 00:11:43.523
So this is a hemispheric issue.

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:48.343
The economic effects
go at least nationally in many ways.

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:51.434
The biological effects
are certainly hemispheric.

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:59.320
I think that this is one of the most
absolutely mind-boggling examples

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.156
of total unpreparedness
that I can even think of.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.078
Even when the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor,

00:12:06.102 --> 00:12:07.509
at least they shot back.

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:11.616
And we just seem to be unable
to figure out what to do.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.276
There was nothing ready,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.690
and, you know, as we can see
by what they're doing.

00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:21.478
Mainly what they're doing
is booms and dispersants.

00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:25.254
The booms are absolutely
not made for open water.

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:30.119
They don't even attempt to corral
the oil where it is most concentrated.

00:12:30.143 --> 00:12:32.377
They get near shore --
Look at these two boats.

00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:35.025
That one on the right
is called Fishing Fool.

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:37.059
And I think, you know, that's a great name

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:40.141
for boats that think
that they're going to do anything

00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:43.237
to make a dent in this,
by dragging a boom between them

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:46.225
when there are literally
hundreds of thousands of square miles

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:49.130
in the Gulf right now
with oil at the surface.

00:12:49.154 --> 00:12:52.904
The dispersants make the oil
go right under the booms.

00:12:52.928 --> 00:12:56.292
The booms are only
about 13 inches in diameter.

00:12:57.127 --> 00:13:00.153
So it's just absolutely crazy.

00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:01.871
Here are shrimp boats employed.

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:05.836
There are hundreds of shrimp boats
employed to drag booms instead of nets.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.183
Here they are working.

00:13:07.207 --> 00:13:09.004
You can see easily

00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:12.923
that all the oily water
just goes over the back of the boom.

00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:14.897
All they're doing is stirring it.

00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:16.519
It's just ridiculous.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.469
Also, for all the shoreline
that has booms --

00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:22.664
hundreds and hundreds
of miles of shoreline --

00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:24.469
all of the shoreline that has booms,

00:13:24.493 --> 00:13:27.179
there's adjacent shoreline
that doesn't have any booms.

00:13:27.203 --> 00:13:32.236
There is ample opportunity for oil
and dirty water to get in behind them.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.083
And that lower photo,
that's a bird colony that has been boomed.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:40.676
Everybody's trying to protect
the bird colonies there.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.931
Well, as an ornithologist,
I can tell you that birds fly, and that --

00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:48.260
(Laughter)

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:56.236
and that booming a bird colony
doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.780
These birds make a living
by diving into the water.

00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.033
In fact ...

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.543
really what I think
they should do, if anything --

00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:09.704
they're trying so hard
to protect those nests --

00:14:09.728 --> 00:14:12.401
actually, if they destroyed
every single nest,

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:14.461
some of the birds would leave,

00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:16.790
and that would be better
for them this year.

00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:19.208
As far as cleaning them ...

00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:25.194
I don't mean to cast any aspersion
on people cleaning birds.

00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:29.118
It's really, really important
that we express our compassion.

00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:32.682
I think that's the most important
thing that people have, is compassion.

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:37.236
It's really important
to get those images and to show it.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.635
But really, where are those birds
going to get released to?

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:43.104
It's like taking somebody
out of a burning building,

00:14:43.128 --> 00:14:44.768
treating them for smoke inhalation

00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:48.545
and sending them back into the building,
because the oil is still gushing.

00:14:48.946 --> 00:14:52.838
I refuse to acknowledge this
as anything like an accident.

00:14:52.862 --> 00:14:56.449
I think that this is the result
of gross negligence.

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:01.236
(Applause)

00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:03.891
Not just BP.

00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:10.572
BP operated very sloppily
and very recklessly because they could.

00:15:10.596 --> 00:15:12.543
And they were allowed to do so

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:16.960
because of the absolute failure
of oversight of the government

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:21.309
that is supposed to be
our government, protecting us.

00:15:23.565 --> 00:15:25.074
It turns out that --

00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:28.329
you see this sign on every commercial
vessel in the United States --

00:15:28.353 --> 00:15:30.955
you know, if you spilled
a couple of gallons of oil,

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:32.358
you would be in big trouble.

00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:36.989
And you have to really wonder
who are the laws made for,

00:15:37.013 --> 00:15:40.685
and who has gotten above the laws.

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:43.060
And there are things
that we can do in the future.

00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:46.136
We could have the kinds of equipment
that we would really need.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.763
It would not take
an awful lot to anticipate

00:15:49.136 --> 00:15:51.531
that after making 30,000 holes

00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:54.380
in the sea floor of the Gulf
of Mexico looking for oil,

00:15:54.404 --> 00:15:56.797
oil might start coming out of one of them.

00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:59.981
And you'd have some idea of what to do.

00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:02.296
That's certainly
one of the things we need to do.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.369
But I think we have to understand
where this leak really started from.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.607
It really started from the destruction
of the idea that the government is there

00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:14.346
because it's our government,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.254
meant to protect
the larger public interest.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.220
So I think that the oil blowout,
the bank bailout,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:32.565
the mortgage crisis and all these things
are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.

00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:36.365
We still seem to understand that at least,

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:40.779
we need the police to protect us
from a few bad people.

00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:43.806
And even though the police
can be a little annoying at times --

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.741
giving us tickets and stuff like that --

00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:48.290
nobody says that we should
just get rid of them.

00:16:48.314 --> 00:16:51.236
But in the entire rest
of government right now

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.122
and for the last at least 30 years,

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:56.236
there has been a culture of deregulation

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.666
that is caused directly by the people
who we need to be protected from,

00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:04.737
buying the government out from under us.

00:17:05.523 --> 00:17:12.523
(Applause)

00:17:15.181 --> 00:17:17.987
Now this has been a problem
for a very, very long time.

00:17:18.425 --> 00:17:23.784
You can see that corporations were illegal
at the founding of America,

00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:26.516
and even Thomas Jefferson complained

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:32.156
that they were already bidding defiance
to the laws of our country.

00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:36.317
OK, people who say they're conservative,

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:41.764
if they really wanted to be
really conservative and patriotic,

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:44.832
they would tell
these corporations to go to hell.

00:17:45.443 --> 00:17:48.260
That's what it would really mean
to be conservative.

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:53.765
So what we really need to do
is regain the idea

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:57.004
that it's our government
safeguarding our interests,

00:17:57.028 --> 00:18:01.236
and regain a sense of unity
and common cause in our country

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.889
that really has been lost.

00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:06.122
I think there are signs of hope.

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:08.236
We seem to be waking up a little bit.

00:18:08.675 --> 00:18:11.687
The Glass-Steagall Act --
which was really to protect us

00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:14.737
from the kind of thing
that caused the recession to happen,

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.453
and the bank meltdown and all that stuff
that required the bailouts --

00:18:18.477 --> 00:18:22.692
that was put in effect in 1933,
was systematically destroyed.

00:18:23.197 --> 00:18:26.934
Now there's a mood to put
some of that stuff back in place,

00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:31.479
but the lobbyists are already there
trying to weaken the regulations

00:18:31.503 --> 00:18:34.236
after the legislation has just passed.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.236
So it's a continued fight.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.308
It's a historic moment right now.

00:18:38.332 --> 00:18:42.345
We're either going to have an absolutely
unmitigated catastrophe

00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:44.006
of this oil leak in the Gulf,

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.676
or we will make the moment
we need out of this,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.367
as many people have noted today.

00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:50.047
There's certainly a common theme

00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.478
about needing to make
the moment out of this.

00:18:52.502 --> 00:18:56.517
We've been through this before
with other ways of offshore drilling.

00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.236
The first offshore wells
were called whales.

00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:02.423
The first offshore drills
were called harpoons.

00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:05.236
We emptied the ocean
of the whales at that time.

00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:07.691
Now are we stuck with this?

00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:11.627
Ever since we lived in caves,
every time we wanted any energy,

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:15.202
we lit something on fire,
and that is still what we're doing.

00:19:15.226 --> 00:19:19.420
We're still lighting something on fire
every time we want energy.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.335
And people say we can't have clean energy

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:25.671
because it's too expensive.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.032
Who says it's too expensive?

00:19:28.056 --> 00:19:30.314
People who sell us fossil fuels.

00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:33.236
We've been here before with energy,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.361
and people saying the economy
cannot withstand a switch,

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:40.597
because the cheapest energy was slavery.

00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:43.378
Energy is always a moral issue.

00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:45.667
It's an issue that is moral right now.

00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:48.234
It's a matter of right and wrong.

00:19:48.258 --> 00:19:49.426
Thank you very much.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.823
(Applause)
