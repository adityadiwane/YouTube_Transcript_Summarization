00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
呢個就係我所認識嘅海洋

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
我發現

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
自從我去過墨西哥灣幾次之後

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
我好心痛

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
因為而家每次我見到個海

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
無論我係邊度

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
即使我知自己喺邊

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
啲油都仲喺度

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
我或多或少見到啲浮油

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
同埋我發現自己都幾

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
被呢件事折磨

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
但我今日想同你哋講嘅係

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
有好多嘢

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
將所有嘢擺埋一齊

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
唔單止漏油

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
仲有呢件事表示乜嘢同埋點解發生

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
首先，少少個人簡介

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
基本上我只係一個熱愛釣魚嘅人

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
細細個已經係咁

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
亦正因為咁

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
我唔再研究海鳥

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
留喺我好中意嘅沿海棲息地

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
而家我主要寫書

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
講解海洋而家點樣變化

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
而海洋都當然變得好快

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
而家我哋見到呢張啱啱見過嘅圖片

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
顯示我哋的確只係住喺一塊大理石上面

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
表面只有

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
少少水份

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
就好似你將粒珠浸落水入面

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
空氣都係同一道理

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
如果你將所有空氣抽出

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
再卷做一個波

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
就會得到右面嗰個小小嘅氣球體

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
所以我哋係依賴緊

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
你想像中最脆弱嘅梘泡仔

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
非常稀有嘅梘泡仔

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
但非常、非常容易引起變化

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
所有燃燒嘅燃油、煤、燃氣

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
所有化石燃料

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
已經嚴重影響大氣層

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
二氧化碳水平越來越高

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
我哋喺度令氣候暖化

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
所以墨西哥灣油井噴油

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
只係一件小問題

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
背後仲有更大嘅問題

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
就係我地利用能用維持社會運作

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
暖化問題以外

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
我哋仲面對海洋持續酸化嘅問題

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
問題已經明顯係咁

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
已經影響緊其他動物

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
喺實驗室

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
你將隻蛤放落pH值

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
唔係8.1

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
呢個係一般海水pH值

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
而係7.5嘅液體裡面

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
隻蛤會喺三日內溶解

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
如果將條海膽幼蟲

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
喺pH 8.1捉出嚟

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
擺落pH 7.7

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
唔會變好多 --

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
變形同埋死

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
有啲地方殖嘅人工蠔幼蟲

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
已經大規模地

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
死亡

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
有啲地方嘅珊瑚礁生得越來越慢

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
正因為呢個問題

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
所以呢個問題真係好重要

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
而家我哋參觀一下

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
墨西哥灣

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
嗰度啲人令我印象深刻嘅其中一個地方

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
就係佢地真係屬於海洋

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
同埋佢哋能夠駕馭海洋

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
佢地能夠駕馭來來往往嘅颱風

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
潮退嗰陣，佢哋知道要做乜嘢

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
但當海洋以外嘅問題出現

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
或者佢哋嘅海洋變咗

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
佢哋就冇乜選擇

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
講真，呢啲社區

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
真係冇乜選擇

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
佢哋冇其他嘢可以做

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
佢哋唔能夠

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
喺本土酒店業工作

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
因為佢哋嘅地區裡面根本冇呢種行業

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
你去墨西哥灣睇睇嘅話

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
你會見到好多石油

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
你會喺個海見到好多石油

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
你會喺海岸線見到好多石油

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
去到漏油嗰度嘅話

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
成個畫面都幾令人難以置信

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
望落就好似你將你架車嘅油底殼裡面啲油

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
倒晒落個海

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
我覺得，其中一樣最不可思議嘅事

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
就係嗰度冇人

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
會嘗試喺最多石油嘅地方

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
收返啲石油

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
嗰度有啲海面

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
望落同世界末日一模一樣

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
沿住岸邊行嘅話

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
就會發現所有地方都係咁

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
真係好混亂

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
如果你去到一啲開始有油污嘅地方

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
例如墨西哥灣東面嘅亞拉巴馬州

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
啲人仲出海灘

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
但已經有人清潔緊海灘

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
但佢地清潔海灘嗰陣，會用一啲好怪嘅方法

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
例如佢哋唔可以將超過十磅嘅沙

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
放落一個五十加侖嘅服袋裡面

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
佢哋有數以千計嘅膠袋

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
我唔知佢地用呢啲嘢嚟做乜

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
但同時仲有人出去海灘

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
佢哋連小小嘅信號都睇唔到

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
上面寫明「切勿下水」

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
佢哋啲細路仲玩水

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
成身衫同拖鞋都係油，真係好亂

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
去到啲油污出現咗一排嘅地方

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
仲亂

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
呢啲地方基本上已經冇晒人

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
仲有好少人嘗試

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
利用個海

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
你會發現呢班好恐慌嘅人

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
其實都係好勤力

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
佢哋一向嘅生活就係大清早起身

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
引擎著咗就開工

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
佢地永遠覺得自己可以依靠

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
大自然畀佢哋嘅信心

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
源於墨西哥灣嘅生態系統

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
佢哋覺得自己嘅世界真係崩潰緊

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
講真，你會發現

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
佢哋恐懼嘅跡象

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
佢哋痛恨嘅跡象

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
佢哋憤怒嘅跡象

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.260
佢哋悲痛嘅跡象

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
呢啲就係你會發現嘅嘢

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
仲有好多你見唔到嘅問題

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
喺海底

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
海底發生咩事？

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
嗯，有人話

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
海底有油柱

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
又有人話冇油柱

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
你知唔知，眾議員馬基問過：

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
係咪要坐潛水艇

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
睇吓有冇油柱？

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
但我坐唔到潛水艇

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.260
尤其當我要嚟到呢度嘅時候

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
我要

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
親自做個小實驗

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
睇睇墨西哥灣到底有冇石油

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
呢個就係墨西哥灣

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
一個多采多彩、有好多魚嘅地方

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
我係嗰度

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
滴咗少少浮油

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
發現咗 -- 其實都證實咗我嘅假設

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
油同水係溝唔埋

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
除非落分散劑

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
之後

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
佢哋開始融合

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
如果令佢地郁少少

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
利用風同海浪

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
之後就會好麻煩

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
係超麻煩

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
就係你清理唔到

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
接觸唔到、提取唔到

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
同埋最重要 -- 我係咁諗 --

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
就係你睇唔到

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
我覺得啲石油係故意被隱藏

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
而家出現咗咁大嘅災難

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
媒體成日泄露消息

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
但正如好多人所講

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
有人極力隱瞞事實嘅真相

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
而我自己覺得

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
分散劑係

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
隱瞞事實嘅主要策略

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
因為我哋要兇手

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
負責處理案發現場

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
但你睇到呢點

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
你睇到啲石油

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
係海面集中喺邊度

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
之後就有人喺度做手腳

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
因為佢地唔想留低證據，我係咁諗

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
好啦

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
有冇聽過食油嘅細菌

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
其車海龜都係

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
當啲油分解

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
就需要好長時間

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
先會輪到細菌

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
海龜都食，但啲油入晒魚鰓

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
佢哋要喺附近游來游去

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
我今日聽到一個最神奇嘅故事

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
就係當我坐火車過嚟嗰陣

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
有位叫泰德威廉斯嘅作家叫我

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
問咗我幾條問題

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
問我見到乜嘢

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
因為佢為奧杜邦雜雜寫緊篇文章

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
佢話嚟左墨西哥灣一陣 --

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
大概一個禮拜 --

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
有個曾經係休閒釣魚導遊嘅人

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
帶佢睇吓佢嗰邊發生咩事

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.260
個導遊全年嘅預約

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.260
取消晒

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
佢冇晒預約

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
個個都想拎返訂金，個個都逃之夭夭

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
成千上萬嘅人都有同樣遭遇

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
但係佢同泰德講

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
係佢出海最後嗰日

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
有隻酒糟鼻海豚

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
忽然係隻船隔離出現

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
佢喺度整走

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
氣孔裡面啲油

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
之後導遊走咗

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
因為嗰次係

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
佢最後一次出海釣魚

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
同埋佢都知道海豚驚魚

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
所以佢離開隻海豚

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
走咗幾分鐘之後

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
隻海豚又係隻船隔離出現

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
導遊話自己釣咗三十年魚

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
未見過有海豚咁做

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260
佢覺得 --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
佢覺得隻海豚係

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
喺度求救，真係可惜

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
今時今日喺埃克森漏油現場

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
大約三成殺人鯨

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
出世後幾個月內死亡

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
佢哋嘅數量從來未回復到以前嘅數字

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
所有嘢嘅回復率

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
都唔同

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.260
有啲需要長啲時間

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
而有啲我諗可能

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
回復得快啲

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
另一樣嘢關於墨西哥灣好重要

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
就係有好多動物

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
聚居喺嗰度

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
喺年中某段時間

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
所以墨西哥灣真係一片好重要嘅海洋 --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
比大西洋裡面同等面積嘅海洋

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
更加重要

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
啲金槍魚游晒成個大西洋

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
嚟到墨西哥灣，跟住去歐洲

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
要產卵嘅時候，佢哋就係入去

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
相中呢兩隻海豚

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
你哋見到佢哋係產卵場度

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
正正就係浮油集中嘅地方

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
最起碼佢哋今年好可能遇到

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
一個災難性嘅產卵期

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
我希望當中嘅大人會

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
避免接觸啲污糟水

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
佢哋通常都唔鐘意落水

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
反正天色都唔太好

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
不過佢哋係優秀嘅

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
運動型動物

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
我唔知啲石油入咗佢哋啲鰓之後會點

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
都唔知啲大人會唔會受影響

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
就算唔會，啲油點都會影響

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
佢哋啲卵同小朋友，我真係咁諗

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
當你見到條曲線不斷向下走

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
呢啲就係我哋對待呢種魚類嘅後果

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
呢幾十年嚟不斷捕魚嘅結果

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
正當今次漏油

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
泄漏、噴出

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
係災難

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
我認為我哋要記住

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
我哋做過非常之多影響海洋生態嘅事

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
做咗好耐好耐

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
我哋實在唔似開始做緊

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
一啲好事

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
反而開始做啲會帶嚟好多困難

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
同壓力嘅事

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
睇睇啲雀鳥

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
墨西哥灣有好多雀鳥

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
年中某段時間集中喺墨西哥灣

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
但之後就飛走

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
但聚居面積更大

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
舉個例

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
圖入面大多數雀鳥都係候鳥

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
佢哋喺五月喺晒墨西哥灣

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
同時某啲地方就有石油飄緊埋岸

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
睇睇左下角嘅

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
翻石鷸同三趾鷸

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
佢哋係北極一帶繁殖

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
冬天就喺南美洲南部度過

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
但佢哋集中喺墨西哥灣

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
跟住遍佈成個北極

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
我見過喺格陵蘭繁殖嘅雀鳥

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
住喺墨西哥灣

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
所以呢個都係南北半球嘅問題

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
經濟衝擊

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
係國家層面上，好多方面都係排最後

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
對於生物嘅影響當然涉及南北半球

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
我覺得呢樣係其中一樣最

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
絕對令人震驚嘅

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
因為毫無防範嘅例子

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
喺我想像得到嘅事之中

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
就算當日本人炸珍珠港

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
起碼佢哋識得還擊

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
而我哋而家就好似

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
唔知道下一步應該點做

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
所有嘢都未準備好

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
而家你睇到

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
我哋所作所為嘅後果

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
佢哋而家主要用緊嘅方法就係輸油管同埋分散劑

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
而啲輸油管絕對唔適用於空曠嘅水域

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
佢哋甚至唔嘗試係最多油嘅地方

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
將啲油集合埋一齊

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
而家啲石油越來越近岸邊，睇吓呢兩隻船

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
右邊嗰隻叫做傻仔釣魚

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
你知唔知，我覺得隻船個名改得好好

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.260
佢哋而家出盡辦法

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
引人注意，例如拖走啲輸油管

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
而家係墨西哥灣嘅幾平方里之內

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
有數以十萬計嘅船嘅表面

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
都有油污

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
而啲分散劑將啲油沉喺輸油管之下

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
啲輸油管直徑大約

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
得十三寸

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
所以成件事絕對係荒唐

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
而家我哋見到啲蝦艇

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
佢哋用幾百隻蝦艇，唔係收網，而係收起輸油管

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
佢哋喺度做緊嘢

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
好容易睇到

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
全部有油污嘅水都走晒去輸油管後面

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
啲油管只係攪緊啲油同水

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
好荒謬

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
仲有，所有裝有輸油管嘅海岸 --

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
上百里計嘅海岸線 --

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
成線海岸線都有輸油管

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
而隔離有海岸係完全冇輸油管

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
有好大機會

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
畀啲油污同受污染嘅水流過去

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
喺下面張相，有片雀鳥棲息地被人裝埋輸油管

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
所有人都非常努力保護

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
嗰度嘅雀鳥棲息地

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
嗯，有位鳥類學者

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
我話你知雀係識得飛，同埋 --

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
(笑聲)

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
喺雀鳥棲息地裝輸油管係

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
冇用；真係冇用

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
啲雀鳥係靠潛落水底搵食物

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
講真

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.260
我覺得佢哋應該做啲乜，就係任何 --

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
佢哋咁努力設法保護啲雀巢 --

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
講真如果佢哋破壞啲巢

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
有啲雀鳥就係飛走

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
咁做對佢哋今年嘅生活都有益處

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
至於將佢哋清洗乾淨

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
我唔係要誹謗

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
為雀鳥清潔嘅人

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
非常非常重要嘅一點

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
就係我哋展示同情嘅一面

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
我覺得人類擁有最重要嘅嘢

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
就係同情

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
我哋真係需要建立呢種形象

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
同埋展示出嚟

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
但講真，啲雀鳥會被放去邊？

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
而家就好似喺火場救人出嚟

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
用濃煙救佢哋

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
跟住送返佢哋入火場，因為啲油仲漏緊

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
我唔會承認呢件事

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
係等同於意外

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
我認為呢個係粗淺而無知嘅結果

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.260
(掌聲)

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
唔淨上英國石油

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
英國石油管理得

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
好草率同魯莽

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
因為佢哋做得出

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
而且佢哋可以咁做

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
就係源於一個我哋以為

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
會保障我哋嘅政府

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
嘅疏忽同失策

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
最終局面係 --

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
你會喺幾乎所有美國船隻上見到呢個標誌 --

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
你知唔知，如果你漏咗幾加侖油

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
你會惹到一身蟻

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
所以你真係要諗清楚

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
到底法律係為邊個而設

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
邊個凌駕於律法之上

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.260
而家我哋可以為未來做啲嘢

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
我哋可以擁有真係需要嘅工具

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
而唔再需要好多人

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
去參與

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
喺墨西哥灣嘅海床

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.260
掘三萬個窿搵石油

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
石油可能從其中一個窿走出嚟

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.260
你可能已經知道我哋可以做乜嘢

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
呢個絕對係其中一樣我哋要做嘅事

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
但我覺得我哋真係要理解清楚今次漏油事件

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
代表乜嘢

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
呢次事件意味著一個想法被瓦解

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.260
就係我哋嘅政府嘅成立

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
就係為咗保衛我哋

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
最大嘅公共利益

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.260
所以我認為漏油事件

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
拯救銀行計劃

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.260
次按危機等所有嘢

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
絕對係同一原因嘅

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
徵兆

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
我哋似乎仍然認為

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.260
我哋起碼需要警察保護我哋

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.260
免受壞人傷害

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
即使警察有時都幾刻人憎 --

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
例如抄牌之類 --

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
但冇話過我哋應該炒晒佢哋

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
但而家其餘所有嘅政府部門

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
喺過去最少三十年

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
出現一種違反規定嘅文化

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
係源於

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
我哋需要從佢地身上

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
得到保護嘅人

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260
叛著我哋買起咗成個政府

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:14.260
(掌聲)

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.260
有個問題存在已久

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
你睇得出

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
有啲公司係美國建國嘅時候，犯過法

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
就算傑弗遜都抱怨過

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.260
當時佢地已經

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260
對抗國家律法

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
好喇，話佢哋

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260
好保守嘅朋友

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.260
如果佢哋真係想

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.260
保守同愛國

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.260
佢哋會叫晒呢啲公司

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.260
去死

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.260
呢啲先係保守

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.260
所以我哋要做嘅係

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.260
收復大眾覺得

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
呢個就係會

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.260
保衛我哋利益嘅政府嘅想法

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
同埋回復團結嘅意識

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260
同已經被遺忘嘅

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
立國宗旨

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.260
我覺得仲有希望嘅跡象

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.260
睇嚟我哋要醒一醒

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
格拉斯-斯蒂格爾法案 --

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
就係旨於避免我哋遇到

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
會導致經濟衰退嘅事

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
1933年銀行倒閉

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
所有銀行都要求援助 --

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
當時法案就出動

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260
而家已經有組織地被廢除

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.260
而家坊間有種情緒想將份法案

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.260
恢復效力

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260
但已經有說客係度

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
嘗試削弱條例

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
自從法例被通過後

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
呢場係耐力戰

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
而家已經到咗歷史性時刻

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
我哋一係會有個完全

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
冇緩和過嘅災難性

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
墨西哥灣漏油事件

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
一係喺事件上利用時機

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
正如而家好多人所講

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
我哋當然都有句口頭襌

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
話需要利用時機

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
我哋之前已經經歷過呢個階段

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
當我哋用緊其他方法離岸採油嗰陣

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.260
第一個海上油井叫鯨魚

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
第一台鑽台叫魚叉

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
當時我哋殺晒海裡面嘅鯨魚

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
而家又想重蹈覆徹？

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
自從人類住喺山洞起

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
每當我哋想要任何能源

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260
我哋起火採光，我哋而家仲係咁做

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
我哋仲係起火採光

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.260
每當我哋要能源

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
有人話

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
我哋冇得用潔淨嘅能源

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
因為太貴

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
邊個話大貴？

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
有人向我哋賣化石燃料

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.260
人類有能源之前已經存在

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.260
有人話經濟

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.260
唔能夠承受轉變

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
因為最平嘅能源就係奴隸

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
能源永遠都係道德問題

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
而家呢個就係道德問題

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.260
一個關於對與錯嘅問題

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260
多謝
