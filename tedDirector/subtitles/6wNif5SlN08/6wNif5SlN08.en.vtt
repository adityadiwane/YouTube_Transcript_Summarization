00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:14.662
I remember when I first found out

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.725
I was going to speak at a TED conference.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.860
I ran across the hall
to one of my classrooms

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.313
to inform my students.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:21.585
"Guess what, guys?

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.687
I've been asked to give a TED Talk."

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:25.742
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.224
The whole room went silent.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.914
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one
you made us watch on grit?

00:00:31.938 --> 00:00:35.633
Or the one with the scientist that did
this really awesome thing with robots?"

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:36.823
Muhammad asked.

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:38.268
"Yes, just like that."

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:41.891
"But Coach, those people
are really important and smart."

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:43.992
(Laughter)

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:45.338
"I know that."

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:50.330
"But Coach, why are you speaking?
You hate public speaking."

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:52.400
"I do," I admitted,

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.753
"But it's important that I speak about us,
that I speak about your journeys,

00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:58.936
about my journey.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.229
People need to know."

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:03.631
The students at the all-refugee
school that I founded

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:06.047
decided to end with some
words of encouragement.

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:07.890
"Cool! It better be good, Coach."

00:01:07.914 --> 00:01:10.614
(Laughter)

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:14.196
There are 65.3 million people
who have been forcibly displaced

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.768
from their homes because
of war or persecution.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.838
The largest number,
11 million, are from Syria.

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:26.142
33,952 people flee their homes daily.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.864
The vast majority remain in refugee camps,

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:35.913
whose conditions cannot be defined
as humane under anyone's definition.

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:40.856
We are participating
in the degradation of humans.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.351
Never have we had numbers this high.

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.496
This is the highest number
of refugees since World War II.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.007
Now, let me tell you why this issue
is so important to me.

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:56.714
I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:01:59.111
I am a Muslim.

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:03.600
I've also spent the last 12 years
of my life working with refugees.

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.066
Oh -- and I'm also gay.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.990
It makes me really popular these days.

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.905
(Laughter)

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.873
But I am the daughter of a refugee.

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:16.374
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964
during the first Assad regime.

00:02:16.398 --> 00:02:19.845
She was three months pregnant
when she packed up a suitcase,

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.963
piled in her five children
and drove to neighboring Jordan,

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:25.999
not knowing what the future held
for her and her family.

00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:29.660
My grandfather decided to stay,
not believing it was that bad.

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:33.856
He followed her a month later,
after his brothers were tortured

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.309
and his factory was taken over
by the government.

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.053
They rebuilt their lives
starting from scratch

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:42.352
and eventually became independently
wealthy Jordanian citizens.

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.282
I was born in Jordan 11 years later.

00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.561
It was really important to my grandmother
for us to know our history

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:51.739
and our journey.

00:02:52.703 --> 00:02:56.320
I was eight years old when she took me
to visit my first refugee camp.

00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:57.784
I didn't understand why.

00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:00.587
I didn't know why
it was so important to her

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.061
for us to go.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.024
I remember walking into the camp
holding her hand,

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.017
and her saying, "Go play with the kids,"

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.544
while she visited
with the women in the camp.

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:11.638
I didn't want to.

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:13.078
These kids weren't like me.

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:14.880
They were poor. They lived in a camp.

00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:16.244
I refused.

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:19.234
She knelt down beside me
and firmly said, "Go.

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.412
And don't come back until you've played.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.476
Don't ever think people are beneath you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.799
or that you have nothing
to learn from others."

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.789
I reluctantly went.

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:30.101
I never wanted to disappoint
my grandmother.

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:32.692
I returned a few hours later,

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:37.346
having spent some time playing soccer
with the kids in the camp.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.136
We walked out of the camp,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.855
and I was excitedly telling her
what a great time I had

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.810
and how fantastic the kids were.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.675
"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them."

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:51.555
"Haram on us," she said,
using the word's different meaning,

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.912
that we were sinning.

00:03:53.822 --> 00:03:56.195
"Don't feel sorry for them;
believe in them."

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:01.590
It wasn't until I left my country
of origin for the United States

00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:03.626
that I realized the impact of her words.

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.681
After my college graduation, I applied for
and was granted political asylum,

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:10.797
based on being a member of a social group.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.220
Some people may not realize this,

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:16.910
but you can still get the death penalty
in some countries for being gay.

00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:20.941
I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:23.414
That was the hardest decision
I've ever had to make,

00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:24.818
but I had no other choice.

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:30.450
The point is,

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:34.402
when you find yourself choosing
between home and survival,

00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:37.258
the question "Where are you from?"
becomes very loaded.

00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:41.859
A Syrian woman who I recently met
at a refugee camp in Greece

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:43.151
articulated it best,

00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:46.745
when she recalled the exact moment
she realized she had to flee Aleppo.

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:49.355
"I looked out the window
and there was nothing.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.738
It was all rubble.

00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:55.205
There were no stores, no streets,
no schools. Everything was gone.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.873
I had been in my apartment for months,

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.967
listening to bombs drop
and watching people die.

00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.654
But I always thought it would get better,

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:06.922
that no one could force me to leave,

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:08.988
no one could take my home away from me.

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:12.887
And I don't know why it was that morning,
but when I looked outside,

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:16.049
I realized if I didn't leave,
my three young children would die.

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:17.462
And so we left.

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:20.490
We left because we had to,
not because we wanted to.

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:22.262
There was no choice," she said.

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:26.076
It's kind of hard to believe
that you belong

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.564
when you don't have a home,

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:31.594
when your country of origin rejects you
because of fear or persecution,

00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:35.522
or the city that you grew up in
is completely destroyed.

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.656
I didn't feel like I had a home.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.137
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:42.793
but I wasn't American, either.

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:45.201
I felt a kind of loneliness

00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:47.344
that is still hard
to put into words today.

00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:51.884
After college, I desperately needed
to find a place to call home.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:54.082
I bounced around from state to state

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:56.541
and eventually ended up in North Carolina.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.690
Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:00.567
offered to pay rent

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:04.539
or buy me a meal or a suit
for my new interview.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:07.586
It just made me feel
more isolated and incapable.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.115
It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.875
a Southern Baptist who took me in
at my lowest and gave me a job,

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:15.792
that I started to believe in myself.

00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:20.312
Miss Sarah owned a diner
in the mountains of North Carolina.

00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:23.845
I assumed, because
of my privileged upbringing

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:25.388
and my Seven Sister education,

00:06:25.412 --> 00:06:27.616
that she would ask me
to manage the restaurant.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.848
I was wrong.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.495
I started off washing dishes,

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.498
cleaning toilets and working the grill.

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:37.152
I was humbled; I was shown
the value of hard work.

00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:39.786
But most importantly,
I felt valued and embraced.

00:06:40.744 --> 00:06:42.624
I celebrated Christmas with her family,

00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:45.000
and she attempted to observe
Ramadan with me.

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:48.726
I remember being very nervous
about coming out to her --

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.792
after all, she was a Southern Baptist.

00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:52.276
I sat on the couch next to her

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.831
and I said, "Miss Sarah,
you know that I'm gay."

00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:57.041
Her response is one
that I will never forget.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:59.734
"That's fine, honey.
Just don't be a slut."

00:06:59.758 --> 00:07:02.930
(Laughter)

00:07:02.954 --> 00:07:05.629
(Applause)

00:07:05.653 --> 00:07:11.565
I eventually moved to Atlanta,
still trying to find my home.

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.460
My journey took a strange turn
three years later,

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:17.717
after I met a group of refugee kids
playing soccer outside.

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.678
I'd made a wrong turn
into this apartment complex,

00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:22.917
and I saw these kids
outside playing soccer.

00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:25.879
They were playing barefoot
with a raggedy soccer ball

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:27.355
and rocks set up as goals.

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.079
I watched them for about an hour,

00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:30.681
and after that I was smiling.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.703
The boys reminded me of home.

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:35.666
They reminded me of the way
I grew up playing soccer

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.320
in the streets of Jordan,
with my brothers and cousins.

00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:41.613
I eventually joined their game.

00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:44.480
They were a little skeptical
about letting me join it,

00:07:44.504 --> 00:07:47.166
because according to them,
girls don't know how to play.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.536
But obviously I did.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.804
I asked them if they had
ever played on a team.

00:07:50.828 --> 00:07:53.262
They said they hadn't,
but that they would love to.

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:56.772
I gradually won them over,
and we formed our first team.

00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:02.555
This group of kids would give me
a crash course in refugees, poverty

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.049
and humanity.

00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:09.750
Three brothers from Afghanistan --
Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --

00:08:09.774 --> 00:08:11.398
played a major role in that.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.768
I showed up late to practice one day
to find the field completely deserted.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:16.973
I was really worried.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.608
My team loved to practice.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:21.239
It wasn't like them to miss practice.

00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:24.351
I got out of my car, and two kids
ran out from behind a dumpster,

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:25.958
waving their hands frantically.

00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:28.962
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.564
There was blood everywhere."

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.043
"What do you mean?
What do you mean he got beat up?"

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:35.140
"These bad kids came
and beat him up, Coach.

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:37.390
Everybody left. They were all scared."

00:08:37.414 --> 00:08:40.132
We hopped into my car
and drove over to Rooh's apartment.

00:08:40.156 --> 00:08:42.655
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.161
"Where's Rooh? I need
to talk to him, see if he's OK."

00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:49.121
"He's in his room, Coach.
He's refusing to come out."

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.312
I knocked on the door.

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:52.762
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.

00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:55.837
I need to see if you're OK
or if we need to go to the hospital."

00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.012
He came out.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.298
He had a big gash on his head,
a split lip,

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.590
and he was physically shaken.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.667
I was looking at him,

00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.250
and I asked the boys
to call for their mom,

00:09:06.274 --> 00:09:08.686
because I needed to go
to the hospital with him.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.017
They called for their mom.

00:09:10.428 --> 00:09:11.620
She came out.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:15.638
I had my back turned to her,
and she started screaming in Farsi.

00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.472
The boys fell to the ground laughing.

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:19.648
I was very confused,

00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:21.746
because there was nothing
funny about this.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.210
They explained to me that she said,

00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:27.048
"You told me your coach
was a Muslim and a woman."

00:09:27.072 --> 00:09:29.441
From behind, I didn't appear
to be either to her.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:33.098
(Laughter)

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:35.358
"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her.

00:09:35.382 --> 00:09:37.313
"Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A)llāh,"

00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:39.706
reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.

00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:41.711
Confused,

00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:45.018
and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured,

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.197
she realized that yes,

00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:49.512
I, this American-acting,
shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman,

00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:50.726
was indeed a Muslim.

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:53.936
Their family had fled the Taliban.

00:09:55.507 --> 00:09:57.211
Hundreds of people in their village

00:09:57.235 --> 00:09:58.481
were murdered.

00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:00.718
Their father was taken in by the Taliban,

00:10:00.742 --> 00:10:04.543
only to return a few months later,
a shell of the man he once was.

00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:08.969
The family escaped to Pakistan,

00:10:08.993 --> 00:10:12.561
and the two older boys,
age eight and 10 at the time,

00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:15.822
wove rugs for 10 hours a day
to provide for their family.

00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:20.503
They were so excited when they found out
that they had been approved

00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:23.019
to resettle in the United States,

00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:26.296
making them the lucky 0.1 percent
who get to do that.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.910
They had hit the jackpot.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.320
Their story is not unique.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:34.813
Every refugee family I have worked with
has had some version of this.

00:10:34.837 --> 00:10:36.177
I work with kids

00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:40.885
who have seen their mothers raped,
their fathers' fingers sliced off.

00:10:40.909 --> 00:10:43.864
One kid saw a bullet
put in his grandmother's head,

00:10:43.888 --> 00:10:47.926
because she refused to let the rebels
take him to be a child soldier.

00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:51.304
Their journeys are haunting.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.534
But what I get to see every day
is hope, resilience, determination,

00:10:57.558 --> 00:10:58.743
a love of life

00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:01.611
and appreciation for being able
to rebuild their lives.

00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:05.552
I was at the boys' apartment one night,

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:10.386
when the mom came home
after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.703
She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,

00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:16.574
saying that he was going to take care
of her once he graduated.

00:11:16.598 --> 00:11:18.092
She smiled from exhaustion.

00:11:18.116 --> 00:11:21.524
"God is good. Life is good.
We are lucky to be here."

00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:27.616
In the last two years, we have seen
an escalating anti-refugee sentiment.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.258
It's global.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.643
The numbers continue to grow
because we do nothing to prevent it

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:35.368
and nothing to stop it.

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:38.944
The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees
from coming into our countries.

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:41.956
The issue should be
not forcing them to leave their own.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.415
(Applause)

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.655
Sorry.

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:03.607
(Applause)

00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:12.262
How much more suffering,

00:12:12.286 --> 00:12:14.331
how much more suffering must we take?

00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:17.846
How many more people need to be
forced out of their homes

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.251
before we say, "Enough!"?

00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:20.484
A hundred million?

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:23.771
Not only do we shame,
blame and reject them

00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:27.898
for atrocities that they had
absolutely nothing to do with,

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:29.987
we re-traumatize them,

00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.976
when we're supposed to be welcoming
them into our countries.

00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:38.414
We strip them of their dignity
and treat them like criminals.

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:41.144
I had a student in my office
a couple of weeks ago.

00:12:41.168 --> 00:12:42.984
She's originally from Iraq.

00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:44.447
She broke down crying.

00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:47.043
"Why do they hate us?"

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.241
"Who hates you?"

00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:51.036
"Everyone; everyone hates us
because we are refugees,

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.416
because we are Muslim."

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.175
In the past, I was able
to reassure my students

00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:58.836
that the majority of the world
does not hate refugees.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.245
But this time I couldn't.

00:13:00.688 --> 00:13:04.168
I couldn't explain to her why someone
tried to rip off her mother's hijab

00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:05.977
when they were grocery shopping,

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:09.245
or why a player on an opposing
team called her a terrorist

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:11.752
and told her to go back
where she came from.

00:13:11.776 --> 00:13:13.538
I couldn't reassure her

00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:15.901
that her father's ultimate life sacrifice

00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:19.045
by serving in the United States
military as an interpreter

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:21.779
would make her more valued
as an American citizen.

00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:25.743
We take in so few refugees worldwide.

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:29.455
We resettle less than 0.1 percent.

00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:33.798
That 0.1 percent benefits us
more than them.

00:13:34.617 --> 00:13:38.403
It dumbfounds me how the word "refugee"
is considered something to be dirty,

00:13:38.427 --> 00:13:40.040
something to be ashamed of.

00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:41.928
They have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:13:45.647 --> 00:13:48.370
We have seen advances
in every aspect of our lives --

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.772
except our humanity.

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:54.782
There are 65.3 million people
who have been forced out of their homes

00:13:54.806 --> 00:13:56.050
because of war --

00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:58.354
the largest number in history.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.987
We are the ones who should be ashamed.

00:14:01.532 --> 00:14:02.687
Thank you.

00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:09.240
(Applause)
