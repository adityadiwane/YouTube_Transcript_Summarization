00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.853
OK, so today I want to talk
about how we talk about love.

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:18.387
And specifically,

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:21.846
I want to talk about what's wrong
with how we talk about love.

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:26.080
Most of us will probably
fall in love a few times

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:27.569
over the course of our lives,

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:31.803
and in the English language,
this metaphor, falling,

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:34.841
is really the main way that we
talk about that experience.

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:36.743
I don't know about you,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.694
but when I conceptualize this metaphor,

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:41.596
what I picture is straight
out of a cartoon --

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.372
like there's a man,

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:45.113
he's walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:48.249
without realizing it, he crosses
over an open manhole,

00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:51.934
and he just plummets into the sewer below.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.038
And I picture it this way
because falling is not jumping.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.801
Falling is accidental,

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.727
it's uncontrollable.

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.276
It's something that happens to us
without our consent.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.493
And this --

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:09.084
this is the main way we talk
about starting a new relationship.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:14.103
I am a writer and I'm also
an English teacher,

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:16.412
which means I think
about words for a living.

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:20.586
You could say that I get paid
to argue that the language we use matters,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
and I would like to argue
that many of the metaphors we use

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.401
to talk about love --

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:28.248
maybe even most of them --

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:29.673
are a problem.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.593
So, in love, we fall.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.231
We're struck.

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:36.651
We are crushed.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.701
We swoon.

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:40.983
We burn with passion.

00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:43.715
Love makes us crazy,

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.303
and it makes us sick.

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:47.156
Our hearts ache,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.186
and then they break.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:53.370
So our metaphors equate
the experience of loving someone

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:56.047
to extreme violence or illness.

00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:58.156
(Laughter)

00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.252
They do.

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:02.259
And they position us as the victims

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:05.642
of unforeseen and totally
unavoidable circumstances.

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:09.270
My favorite one of these is "smitten,"

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:12.148
which is the past participle
of the word "smite."

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:15.240
And if you look this word up
in the dictionary --

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:16.288
(Laughter)

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.830
you will see that it can be defined
as both "grievous affliction,"

00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.705
and, "to be very much in love."

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:29.060
I tend to associate the word "smite"
with a very particular context,

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:30.648
which is the Old Testament.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.308
In the Book of Exodus alone,
there are 16 references to smiting,

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:40.105
which is the word that the Bible uses
for the vengeance of an angry God.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.850
(Laughter)

00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:44.579
Here we are using the same word
to talk about love

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:47.029
that we use to explain
a plague of locusts.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:48.081
(Laughter)

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:49.361
Right?

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.477
So, how did this happen?

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.492
How have we come to associate love
with great pain and suffering?

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:59.505
And why do we talk about
this ostensibly good experience

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.633
as if we are victims?

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:04.247
These are difficult questions,

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.917
but I have some theories.

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:07.180
And to think this through,

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.832
I want to focus on one
metaphor in particular,

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.027
which is the idea of love as madness.

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:15.795
When I first started
researching romantic love,

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.580
I found these madness
metaphors everywhere.

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:20.707
The history of Western culture

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.668
is full of language that equates
love to mental illness.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.367
These are just a few examples.

00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:28.734
William Shakespeare:

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:30.191
"Love is merely a madness,"

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:31.532
from "As You Like It."

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:33.349
Friedrich Nietzsche:

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:35.876
"There is always some madness in love."

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.425
"Got me looking, got me looking
so crazy in love -- "

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.518
(Laughter)

00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:44.140
from the great philosopher,
Beyoncé Knowles.

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:45.625
(Laughter)

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.917
I fell in love for the first
time when I was 20,

00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:53.120
and it was a pretty turbulent
relationship right from the start.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.664
And it was long distance
for the first couple of years,

00:03:56.688 --> 00:04:01.284
so for me that meant very high highs
and very low lows.

00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:03.998
I can remember one moment in particular.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.925
I was sitting on a bed
in a hostel in South America,

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.645
and I was watching the person
I love walk out the door.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.764
And it was late,

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:15.048
it was nearly midnight,

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:17.049
we'd gotten into an argument over dinner,

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.022
and when we got back to our room,

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:21.771
he threw his things in the bag
and stormed out.

00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.400
While I can no longer remember
what that argument was about,

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:30.479
I very clearly remember
how I felt watching him leave.

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:34.667
I was 22, it was my first time
in the developing world,

00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:37.679
and I was totally alone.

00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:41.779
I had another week until my flight home,

00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:44.171
and I knew the name
of the town that I was in,

00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:47.778
and the name of the city
that I needed to get to to fly out,

00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:51.058
but I had no idea how to get around.

00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:55.019
I had no guidebook and very little money,

00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:56.813
and I spoke no Spanish.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.644
Someone more adventurous than me

00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:02.098
might have seen this as
a moment of opportunity,

00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:03.952
but I just froze.

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:06.223
I just sat there.

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.781
And then I burst into tears.

00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:11.728
But despite my panic,

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:14.322
some small voice in my head thought,

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.683
"Wow. That was dramatic.

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:19.406
I must really be doing
this love thing right."

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.218
(Laughter)

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:25.762
Because some part of me
wanted to feel miserable in love.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:29.666
And it sounds so strange
to me now, but at 22,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.835
I longed to have dramatic experiences,

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:38.057
and in that moment, I was irrational
and furious and devastated,

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.305
and weirdly enough,

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:42.705
I thought that this somehow
legitimized the feelings I had

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.568
for the guy who had just left me.

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:50.526
I think on some level I wanted
to feel a little bit crazy,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.082
because I thought that
that was how loved worked.

00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:56.948
This really should not be surprising,

00:05:56.972 --> 00:05:59.426
considering that according to Wikipedia,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.723
there are eight films,

00:06:01.747 --> 00:06:03.744
14 songs,

00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:06.965
two albums and one novel
with the title "Crazy Love."

00:06:07.837 --> 00:06:10.963
About half an hour later,
he came back to our room.

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:12.138
We made up.

00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:14.979
We spent another mostly
happy week traveling together.

00:06:15.003 --> 00:06:16.435
And then, when I got home,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:21.443
I thought, "That was so
terrible and so great.

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:23.704
This must be a real romance."

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.706
I expected my first love
to feel like madness,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.510
and of course, it met
that expectation very well.

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.632
But loving someone like that --

00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:37.751
as if my entire well-being depended
on him loving me back --

00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:39.868
was not very good for me

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:41.042
or for him.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.551
But I suspect this experience of love
is not that unusual.

00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:50.237
Most of us do feel a bit mad
in the early stages of romantic love.

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:54.631
In fact, there is research to confirm
that this is somewhat normal,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.166
because, neurochemically speaking,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.752
romantic love and mental illness
are not that easily distinguished.

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.197
This is true.

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.780
This study from 1999 used blood tests

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:11.898
to confirm that the serotonin
levels of the newly in love

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:14.719
very closely resembled
the serotonin levels

00:07:14.743 --> 00:07:18.048
of people who had been diagnosed
with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:19.080
(Laughter)

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.801
Yes, and low levels of serotonin

00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:25.427
are also associated
with seasonal affective disorder

00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:26.731
and depression.

00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:29.947
So there is some evidence

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:34.319
that love is associated with changes
to our moods and our behaviors.

00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:38.350
And there are other studies to confirm

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:42.064
that most relationships begin this way.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.823
Researchers believe
that the low levels of serotonin

00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:50.882
is correlated with obsessive thinking
about the object of love,

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:54.964
which is like this feeling that someone
has set up camp in your brain.

00:07:54.988 --> 00:07:57.919
And most of us feel this way
when we first fall in love.

00:07:57.943 --> 00:08:01.069
But the good news is,
it doesn't always last that long --

00:08:01.093 --> 00:08:04.266
usually from a few months
to a couple of years.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:08.160
When I got back from my trip
to South America,

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:11.761
I spent a lot of time alone in my room,

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.125
checking my email,

00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:15.512
desperate to hear from the guy I loved.

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:21.893
I decided that if my friends could not
understand my grievous affliction,

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:23.866
then I did not need their friendship.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.973
So I stopped hanging out
with most of them.

00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:30.581
And it was probably the most
unhappy year of my life.

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:35.200
But I think I felt like
it was my job to be miserable,

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.641
because if I could be miserable,

00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:40.332
then I would prove how much I loved him.

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.241
And if I could prove it,

00:08:42.265 --> 00:08:45.219
then we would have to end up
together eventually.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.138
This is the real madness,

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:50.557
because there is no cosmic rule

00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:53.943
that says that great suffering
equals great reward,

00:08:54.478 --> 00:08:58.382
but we talk about love as if this is true.

00:08:59.463 --> 00:09:03.139
Our experiences of love
are both biological and cultural.

00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:06.233
Our biology tells us that love is good

00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:09.411
by activating these reward
circuits in our brain,

00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:14.055
and it tells us that love is painful
when, after a fight or a breakup,

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:16.689
that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:19.597
And in fact -- and maybe
you've heard this --

00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:21.465
neurochemically speaking,

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:24.923
going through a breakup is a lot
like going through cocaine withdrawal,

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:27.311
which I find reassuring.

00:09:27.335 --> 00:09:28.485
(Laughter)

00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:31.898
And then our culture uses language

00:09:31.922 --> 00:09:34.703
to shape and reinforce
these ideas about love.

00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:37.351
In this case, we're talking
about metaphors about pain

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.890
and addiction and madness.

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:42.270
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.

00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:45.811
Love is powerful and at times painful,

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.600
and we express this
in our words and stories,

00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:51.680
but then our words and stories prime us

00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:55.166
to expect love to be powerful and painful.

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:59.128
What's interesting to me
is that all of this happens

00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:01.875
in a culture that values
lifelong monogamy.

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:04.719
It seems like we want it both ways:

00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:07.094
we want love to feel like madness,

00:10:07.718 --> 00:10:10.864
and we want it to last an entire lifetime.

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:13.124
That sounds terrible.

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:14.677
(Laughter)

00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:17.449
To reconcile this,

00:10:17.473 --> 00:10:22.498
we need to either change our culture
or change our expectations.

00:10:23.408 --> 00:10:27.001
So, imagine if we were all
less passive in love.

00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:31.788
If we were more assertive,
more open-minded, more generous

00:10:31.812 --> 00:10:35.113
and instead of falling in love,

00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:37.362
we stepped into love.

00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:40.152
I know that this is asking a lot,

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:43.650
but I'm not actually
the first person to suggest this.

00:10:45.012 --> 00:10:47.521
In their book, "Metaphors We Live By,"

00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:52.659
linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff
suggest a really interesting solution

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:53.901
to this dilemma,

00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:56.907
which is to change our metaphors.

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:02.212
They argue that metaphors really do shape
the way we experience the world,

00:11:03.071 --> 00:11:06.569
and that they can even act
as a guide for future actions,

00:11:06.593 --> 00:11:08.481
like self-fulfilling prophecies.

00:11:09.489 --> 00:11:13.045
Johnson and Lakoff suggest
a new metaphor for love:

00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:16.091
love as a collaborative work of art.

00:11:16.872 --> 00:11:19.922
I really like this way
of thinking about love.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:24.550
Linguists talk about metaphors
as having entailments,

00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:28.370
which is essentially a way of considering
all the implications of,

00:11:28.394 --> 00:11:31.326
or ideas contained
within, a given metaphor.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.259
And Johnson and Lakoff
talk about everything

00:11:34.283 --> 00:11:36.435
that collaborating
on a work of art entails:

00:11:36.976 --> 00:11:41.131
effort, compromise,
patience, shared goals.

00:11:41.655 --> 00:11:45.485
These ideas align nicely
with our cultural investment

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:47.582
in long-term romantic commitment,

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:51.217
but they also work well
for other kinds of relationships --

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.676
short-term, casual, polyamorous,
non-monogamous, asexual --

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.585
because this metaphor brings
much more complex ideas

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:03.649
to the experience of loving someone.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.064
So if love is a collaborative work of art,

00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:12.500
then love is an aesthetic experience.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.419
Love is unpredictable,

00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.177
love is creative,

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:23.031
love requires communication
and discipline,

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:26.244
it is frustrating
and emotionally demanding.

00:12:26.677 --> 00:12:30.027
And love involves both joy and pain.

00:12:30.742 --> 00:12:34.361
Ultimately, each experience
of love is different.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.386
When I was younger,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.078
it never occurred to me that I was allowed
to demand more from love,

00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:45.795
that I didn't have to just accept
whatever love offered.

00:12:46.775 --> 00:12:50.104
When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --

00:12:50.128 --> 00:12:54.053
or, when 14-year-old Juliet
cannot be with Romeo,

00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:56.714
whom she has met four days ago,

00:12:56.738 --> 00:13:00.548
she does not feel disappointed or angsty.

00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:02.379
Where is she?

00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:03.697
She wants to die.

00:13:04.236 --> 00:13:05.387
Right?

00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:07.880
And just as a refresher,
at this point in the play,

00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:09.212
act three of five,

00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:11.057
Romeo is not dead.

00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:12.981
He's alive,

00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:14.393
he's healthy,

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:16.611
he's just been banished from the city.

00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:23.854
I understand that 16th-century Verona
is unlike contemporary North America,

00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:26.856
and yet when I first read this play,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.273
also at age 14,

00:13:29.297 --> 00:13:31.980
Juliet's suffering made sense to me.

00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:38.652
Reframing love as something
I get to create with someone I admire,

00:13:38.676 --> 00:13:41.120
rather than something
that just happens to me

00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:43.666
without my control or consent,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.295
is empowering.

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:47.397
It's still hard.

00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:52.953
Love still feels totally maddening
and crushing some days,

00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:55.092
and when I feel really frustrated,

00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:56.446
I have to remind myself:

00:13:56.995 --> 00:14:00.339
my job in this relationship
is to talk to my partner

00:14:00.363 --> 00:14:02.414
about what I want to make together.

00:14:03.923 --> 00:14:06.257
This isn't easy, either.

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:10.203
But it's just so much better
than the alternative,

00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:13.449
which is that thing
that feels like madness.

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:20.196
This version of love is not about winning
or losing someone's affection.

00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:24.359
Instead, it requires
that you trust your partner

00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:27.457
and talk about things
when trusting feels difficult,

00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:29.927
which sounds so simple,

00:14:29.951 --> 00:14:34.447
but is actually a kind
of revolutionary, radical act.

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:38.326
This is because you get to stop
thinking about yourself

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.371
and what you're gaining
or losing in your relationship,

00:14:42.395 --> 00:14:45.792
and you get to start thinking
about what you have to offer.

00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:50.216
This version of love
allows us to say things like,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.070
"Hey, we're not very good collaborators.
Maybe this isn't for us."

00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:59.594
Or, "That relationship
was shorter than I had planned,

00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:01.790
but it was still kind of beautiful."

00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:05.626
The beautiful thing
about the collaborative work of art

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.541
is that it will not paint
or draw or sculpt itself.

00:15:09.098 --> 00:15:13.009
This version of love allows us
to decide what it looks like.

00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:14.184
Thank you.

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:16.231
(Applause)
