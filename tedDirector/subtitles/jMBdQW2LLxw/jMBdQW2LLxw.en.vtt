00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:13.836
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:16.248
of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.692
but I thought it would just be nice to recap

00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:22.628
on how Derek got to where he is today.

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.119
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.737
but when Derek was born,

00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:29.376
he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:32.340
He was born three and a half months premature,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.556
and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:38.776
He had to have a lot of oxygen,

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:40.776
and that affected your eyes, Derek,

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:42.604
and also the way you understand language

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:45.575
and the way you understand the world.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.642
But that was the end of the bad news,

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.648
because when Derek came home from the hospital,

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:53.830
his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.201
who was going to look after you, Derek,

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.849
really for the rest of your childhood.

00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.425
And Nanny's great insight, really,

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.110
was to think, here's a child who can't see.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.031
Music must be the thing for Derek.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:11.298
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:14.843
to him for his first few years of life.

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:18.894
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:21.878
hour after hour every day that made him think

00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:24.896
maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.905
some sort of musical gift.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.178
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,

00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:33.852
when you were with your nanny.

00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:37.371
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,

00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:40.706
perhaps we should get Derek something to play,

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:44.342
and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.923
out of the loft, never thinking really

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:49.281
that anything much would come of it.

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:52.269
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:53.890
and actually bashed it,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.679
bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.671
But out of all the bashing, after a few months,

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.840
emerged the most fantastic music,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.206
and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:11.721
when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world

00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:15.321
out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:17.834
That was the great eureka moment.

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.404
Now, not being able to see meant, of course,

00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:21.595
that you taught yourself.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:22.919
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.216
AO: You did teach yourself to play,

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.747
and as a consequence,

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:27.798
playing the piano for you, Derek,

00:02:27.798 --> 00:02:30.275
was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.731
and even a bit of nose going on in there.

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.059
And now, here's what Nanny did also do

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.381
was to press the record button on one of those little

00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:41.939
early tape recorders that they had,

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.042
and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.454
when you were four years old.

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:48.152
DP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."

00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:49.214
AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."

00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:51.364
This one is "English Country Garden."

00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:53.629
DP: "English Country Garden."

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:01.888
(Music: "English Country Garden")

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.319
AO: There you are.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.477
(Applause)

00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:41.383
I think that's just fantastic.

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:43.113
You know, there's this little child who can't see,

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:45.320
can't really understand much about the world,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.026
has no one in the family who plays an instrument,

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.327
and yet he taught himself to play that.

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:51.559
And as you can see from the picture,

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.918
there was quite a lot of body action going on

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:55.719
while you were playing, Derek.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.289
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:04.107
and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:05.921
because when you played the piano,

00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.838
you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:10.246
and also you had this little habit

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:12.429
of hitting me out of the way.

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.235
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,

00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:16.383
I was firmly shoved off.

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.067
And having said to your dad, Nic,

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.562
that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.149
as to how I might go about that

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.550
if I wasn't allowed near the piano.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.727
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:31.828
is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,

00:04:31.828 --> 00:04:34.972
and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:37.149
I could just play something very quickly

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.141
for him to learn.

00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:40.543
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:44.523
that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.

00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:47.348
As you can see, there's me in my early,

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:49.587
pre-marriage days with a brown beard,

00:04:49.587 --> 00:04:53.233
and little Derek concentrating there.

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:55.777
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.

00:04:55.777 --> 00:04:57.079
(Laughter)

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:01.300
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.352
had taken the world by storm.

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:06.370
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.081
with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.

00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:12.650
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.791
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,

00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:17.102
and so there was always a moment of tension

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:20.063
as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.574
and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,

00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:24.033
and all that kind of thing.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:26.858
But the orchestra were wowed as well,

00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:30.715
and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:34.052
to play these fantastic pieces.

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:37.114
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?

00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:39.685
And hopefully we can show the audience now

00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:42.737
how it is you do what you do.

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:44.570
I think that one of the first things that happened

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.847
when you were very little, Derek,

00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:48.183
was that by the time you were two,

00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:53.162
your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.

00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:55.960
And so whenever you heard any note at all --

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.864
if I just play a random note --

00:05:57.864 --> 00:06:00.277
(Piano notes) --

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:02.183
you knew instantly what it was,

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:06.421
and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.

00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:08.009
Now that's called perfect pitch,

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.246
and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.396
in the middle of the piano.

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:18.424
(Piano notes)

00:06:18.424 --> 00:06:21.850
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.398
(Applause)

00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:28.424
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.

00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:29.851
If I just put the microphone down for a bit,

00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:32.571
I'm going to play a cluster of notes.

00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.887
Those of you who can see will know how many notes,

00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:35.896
but Derek, of course, can't.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.798
Not only can you say how many notes,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:44.222
it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.

00:06:44.222 --> 00:06:51.300
(Chords)

00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.921
Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.

00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:01.866
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.188
not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,

00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:06.096
Derek, you can hear every note,

00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:09.352
and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,

00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:11.310
reproduce those on the keyboard,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.577
that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:18.180
Now then.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.748
It's no use having that kind of raw ability

00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:23.509
without the technique,

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.431
and luckily, Derek, you decided that,

00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.053
once we did start learning, you'd let me help you

00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:29.692
learn all the scale fingerings.

00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:32.639
So for example using your thumb under with C major.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.752
(Piano notes)

00:07:37.752 --> 00:07:41.766
Etc.

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:47.521
And in the end, you got so quick,

00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:49.395
that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee"

00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:50.625
were no problem, were they?

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:51.903
DP: No.

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:54.532
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,

00:07:54.532 --> 00:07:56.504
Derek was playing things like this.

00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:59.586
DP: This.

00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:13.259
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:09.358
(Applause)

00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:11.834
AO: Derek, let's have a bow.

00:09:23.408 --> 00:09:27.480
Well done.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.403
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:33.638
you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"

00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:36.304
in the usual key, but any note I play,

00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:38.297
Derek can play it on.

00:09:38.297 --> 00:09:40.765
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.

00:09:40.765 --> 00:09:42.580
(Piano notes)

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.184
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.488
DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.

00:09:46.488 --> 00:09:50.853
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:09:52.178 --> 00:09:56.251
AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?

00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:58.522
DP: G minor.

00:09:58.522 --> 00:10:03.833
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:06.117
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.

00:10:06.117 --> 00:10:09.899
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:13.598
that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,

00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:15.770
all the pieces in the world that are out there.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.197
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:20.014
"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'

00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:23.244
in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:26.665
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,

00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:28.754
you'd learned the version that you'd learned,

00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:30.983
and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,

00:10:30.983 --> 00:10:33.461
so while we were waiting in the two hours

00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:35.463
before the rehearsal and the concert,

00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:37.703
Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:40.180
and then was able to play it with the orchestra.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.640
Fantastic chap.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.099
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.

00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:48.935
DP: Memory.
AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,

00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:51.765
we ask the audience to participate, of course,

00:10:51.765 --> 00:10:55.529
by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.051
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave

00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.276
because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.288
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,

00:11:00.288 --> 00:11:02.940
because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.541
you're invited to come and sing it first,

00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.027
and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)

00:11:07.027 --> 00:11:11.742
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.

00:11:11.742 --> 00:11:15.459
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?

00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:19.392
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose?
AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.

00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:22.213
Would you like to hear me play?

00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:23.427
(Audience: "Theme of Paganini.")

00:11:23.427 --> 00:11:26.389
AO: Paganini.
DP: "The Theme of Paganini."

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:28.227
(Laughter)

00:11:28.227 --> 00:11:50.138
(Music: "Theme of Paganini")

00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:14.409
(Applause)

00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:20.223
AO: Well done.

00:13:20.223 --> 00:13:22.897
Derek's going to L.A. soon,

00:13:22.897 --> 00:13:26.119
and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:29.490
will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.117
which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?

00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:35.468
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.

00:13:35.468 --> 00:13:37.930
AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.448
but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.

00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:42.560
(Laughter)

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.434
But in America, they've coined this term,

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:46.044
"the human iPod" for Derek,

00:13:46.044 --> 00:13:48.400
which I think is just missing the point, really,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.477
because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.

00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:54.264
You're a fantastic, creative musician,

00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:57.215
and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,

00:13:57.215 --> 00:13:59.412
than when we went to Slovenia,

00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:04.809
and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:08.463
and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.

00:14:08.463 --> 00:14:10.998
DP: He played "Chopsticks."
AO: And played "Chopsticks."

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:12.489
DP: "Chopsticks."

00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:15.853
AO: A bit like this.
DP: Like this. Yes.

00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:16.791
(Piano notes)

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:18.471
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.

00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:19.695
He's sitting there.

00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:22.973
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this.
AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.

00:14:22.973 --> 00:14:24.229
(Music: "Chopsticks")

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:26.491
DP: Let Derek play it.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.064
AO: What did you do with it, Derek?

00:14:28.064 --> 00:14:29.805
DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:33.372
AO: This is Derek the musician.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:41.484
(Music: "Chopsticks" improvisation)

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:31.860
(Applause)

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.636
(Music) (Clapping)

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:37.777
Keep up with Derek.

00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:45.274
(Music)

00:16:32.017 --> 00:16:38.589
(Applause)

00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:56.579
The TED people will kill me,

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:58.635
but perhaps there's time for one encore.

00:16:58.635 --> 00:17:02.460
DP: For one encore.
AO: One encore, yes.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.515
So this is one of Derek's heroes.

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:06.687
It's the great Art Tatum --
DP: Art Tatum.

00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:08.713
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,

00:17:08.713 --> 00:17:09.870
and also, I think, like Derek,

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.379
thought that all the world was a piano,

00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:13.339
so whenever Art Tatum plays something,

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.974
it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:21.798
And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."

00:17:21.798 --> 00:17:25.534
DP: "Tiger Rag."

00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:44.702
(Music: "Tiger Rag")

00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:19.869
(Applause)
