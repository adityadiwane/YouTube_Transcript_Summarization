00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.616
When I was first learning to meditate,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.696
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.800
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.000
Sounded simple enough.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.896
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.256
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.616
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
Actually, it was exhausting.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.136
The instruction was simple enough

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.280
but I was missing something
really important.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.536
Well, studies show

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.736
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.336
like maybe this talk --

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.576
at some point,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.936
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.040
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.880
So what's going on here?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.456
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.336
learning processes
currently known in science,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.576
one that's conserved

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.040
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.496
This reward-based learning process

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.696
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.280
and basically goes like this.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.896
We see some food that looks good,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.616
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.136
We eat the food, we taste it --

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.376
it tastes good.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.936
And especially with sugar,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.216
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.720
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.016
We lay down this context-dependent memory

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.496
and learn to repeat the process next time.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.736
See food,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.456
eat food, feel good,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.936
repeat.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.576
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.800
Simple, right?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.056
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.296
"You know what?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.936
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.136
You know, next time you feel bad,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.600
why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.736
We thank our brains for the great idea,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.336
try this and quickly learn

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.656
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.880
we feel better.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.016
Same process,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.776
just a different trigger.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.896
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.896
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.200
triggers that urge to eat.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560
Maybe in our teenage years,

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.600
we were a nerd at school,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.296
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.576
"Hey, I want to be cool."

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.800
So we start smoking.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.536
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.776
See cool,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.096
smoke to be cool,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.936
feel good. Repeat.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.896
And each time we do this,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.936
we learn to repeat the process

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.200
and it becomes a habit.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.216
So later,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.856
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.280
or to eat something sweet.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.136
Now, with these same brain processes,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.056
we've gone from learning to survive

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.936
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.216
Obesity and smoking

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.520
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.880
So back to my breath.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.096
What if instead of fighting our brains,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.656
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.696
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.920
but added a twist?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.576
What if instead we just got really curious

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.096
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.656
I'll give you an example.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.896
In my lab,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.256
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.936
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.216
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.176
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.120
on average, six times.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.456
Now, with mindfulness training,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.800
we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.816
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.816
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.376
just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.096
And what did they notice?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.816
Well here's an example
from one of our smokers.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.576
She said, "Mindful smoking:

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.216
smells like stinky cheese

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.856
and tastes like chemicals,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.080
YUCK!"

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.056
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.960
that's why she joined our program.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.216
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.376
was that smoking tastes like shit.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.080
(Laughter)

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.375
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.495
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.976
to knowing it in her bones,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.296
and the spell of smoking was broken.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.680
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.056
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.616
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.696
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.536
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.896
to help us stop smoking,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.040
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.456
We call this cognitive control.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.280
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.176
Unfortunately,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.136
this is also the first part of our brain

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.176
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.456
which isn't that helpful.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.957
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:20.136
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.776
when we're stressed out or tired,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.136
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.680
We just can't help ourselves.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.296
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.536
we fall back into our old habits,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.416
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.096
Seeing what we get from our habits

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.296
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.576
to know it in our bones

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.856
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.616
or restrain ourselves from behavior.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.416
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.976
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.680
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.136
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.280
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.416
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.056
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.416
the results of our actions,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.080
we let go of old habits and form new ones.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.456
The paradox here

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.296
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.736
in getting close and personal

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.336
with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.976
from moment to moment.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.296
This willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.000
rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.336
And this willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.216
is supported by curiosity,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.976
which is naturally rewarding.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.736
What does curiosity feel like?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.960
It feels good.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.346
And what happens when we get curious?

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.816
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.096
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.776
there's restlessness --

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.240
and that these body
sensations come and go.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.856
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.896
that we can manage from moment to moment

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.056
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.456
that we choke on.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.976
In other words, when we get curious,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.736
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.976
and we step into being.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.896
We become this inner scientist

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.136
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.696
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.176
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.096
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.560
So it actually works.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.616
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.456
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.056
called the default mode network

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.296
were at play.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.256
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.496
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.256
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.896
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.616
and it takes us for a ride.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.736
In contrast, when we let go --

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.136
step out of the process

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.656
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.800
this same brain region quiets down.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.416
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.576
that target these core mechanisms

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.096
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.656
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.696
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.296
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.216
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.496
in the contexts that matter most.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.736
So we can help them

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.736
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.680
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.456
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.135
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.399
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:50.222
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.936
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.216
just be curiously aware

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.176
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.656
It will just be another chance

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.336
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.600
or step out of it.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.976
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.736
feel a little bit better --

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.216
notice the urge,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.696
get curious,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.656
feel the joy of letting go

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.880
and repeat.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.656
Thank you.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.040
(Applause)
