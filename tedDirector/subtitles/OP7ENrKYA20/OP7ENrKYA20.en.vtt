00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.595
I was born in Taiwan.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.419
I grew up surrounded by

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.119
different types of hardware stores,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.467
and I like going to night markets.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.307
I love the energy of the night markets,

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:25.859
the colors, the lights, the toys,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.302
and all the unexpected things I find every time I go,

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:32.672
things like watermelon with straw antennas

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:36.494
or puppies with mohawks.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.304
When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.328
any kind of toys I'd find around the house,

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:43.562
like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:45.580
I also liked to make environments

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.668
for people to explore and play.

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:49.618
In these early installations,

00:00:49.618 --> 00:00:52.146
I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.986
and things I would find in the hardware store

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.202
or around the house.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.938
I would take things like highlighter pen,

00:00:57.938 --> 00:01:01.390
mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.902
creating these glowing circulatory systems

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:06.286
for people to walk through and enjoy.

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.794
I like these materials because of the way they look,

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:12.090
the way they feel, and they're very affordable.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.916
I also liked to make devices
that work with body parts.

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.094
I would take camera LED lights

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.235
and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:21.394
and I would videotape my belly button,

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:22.416
get a different perspective,

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.778
and see what it does.

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:26.940
(Laughter)

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.522
I also like to modify household appliances.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.820
This is an automatic night light.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.434
Some of you might have them at home.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:34.066
I would cut out the light sensor,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.970
add an extension line,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.466
and use modeling clay,

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.242
stick it onto the television,

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:41.254
and then I would videotape my eye,

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:43.122
and using the dark part of my eye

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.002
tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.754
so you turn on the lightbulb.

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:48.674
The white of the eye and the eyelid

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.866
will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.632
and it will shut off the light.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:55.720
I wanted to collect more different types of eyes,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.464
so I built this device using bicycle helmets,

00:01:58.464 --> 00:02:00.880
some lightbulbs and television sets.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.271
It would be easier for other
people to wear the helmet

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.596
and record their eyes.

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:08.718
This device allows me to symbolically

00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:10.262
extract other people's eyes,

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.159
so I have a diversity of eyes to use

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.289
for my other sculptures.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.589
This sculpture has four eyes.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.757
Each eye is controlling a different device.

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:28.237
This eye is turning itself around in a television.

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:30.653
This eye is inflating a plastic tube.

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:34.229
This eye is watching a video
of another piece being made.

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.191
And these two eyes are activating glowing water.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.173
Many of these pieces are later on shown

00:02:40.173 --> 00:02:42.517
in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.867
around the world.

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:47.230
I love science and biology.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.717
In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:51.765
at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:54.573
looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.677
I love these creatures. I love the
way they look, the way they feel.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.535
They're soft, they're slimy,

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.725
and I was fascinated by the way they use light

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:03.950
in their environment,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.020
either to attract mates, for self-defense,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.818
or to attract food.

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:11.237
This research inspired my
work in many different ways,

00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:15.501
things like movement or different light patterns.

00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:19.621
So I started gathering a lot of

00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:22.352
different types of material in my studio

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:23.547
and just experimenting

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:25.371
and trying this out, trying that out,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.995
and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.259
I used a lot of computer cooling fans

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.755
and just kind of put them
together and see what happens.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.955
This is an 8,000-square-foot installation

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:37.363
composed of many different creatures,

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:40.846
some hanging from the ceiling
and some resting on the floor.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.134
From afar, they look alien-like,

00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:43.802
but when you look closer,

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:45.330
they're all made out of black garbage bags

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.950
or Tupperware containers.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.910
I'd like to share with you how ordinary things

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.418
can become something magical and wondrous.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.986
(Applause)

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.735
Thank you.

00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:09.865
(Applause)
