00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What I want to talk about is, as background,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is the idea that cars are art.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is actually quite meaningful to me,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and cars are thought so much as a product

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is completely different than automobiles.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
they've also been a real pain in the ass,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but that's not what interests me in this speech.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but cars are what we are, in many ways.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and try and understand why this hook is in many of us --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Many people think, "Well, it's computers,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and it's done by machines and stuff like that."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
then you put something new into it,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and at the same time, that sense of obligation

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to the regards of craftsmanship --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We work in clay, which hasn't changed much

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
since Michelangelo started screwing around with it,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There we go, the automobile.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I want to talk about this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
at least when it comes to cars --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
comes right back to this idea of the mean.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
or when somebody works like this.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We don't really have a problem talking about love.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
That's what we're searching for --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
instead of this quantum approach.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We're dealing with irrationalisms,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in why we're doing what we're doing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that we are the women in the organization at BMW --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
it's really a truth.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
with soul. You know how strong this is.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
put the word "design" in, and it still works,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You can understand that. It works in truisms.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
"All is fair in design and war."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Certainly we live in a competitive society.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I think this one here, there's a pop song

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Toothbrush, cool.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Laughter)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is one substitution that I believe

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
all of us, in design management, are guilty of.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And this idea that there is more to love,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But right now it's in dealing with our own people,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The idea of people-work is what we work with here,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that means we have to work as one family;

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
we have to understand ourselves that way.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There's good times; there's interesting times;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and there's some stress times too.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
we are completely in love with our own creations.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This is sick beyond belief.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I heard today about Joseph's death genes

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Someone's love, someone's baby.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
They've got that gene infected in them as well,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and they want that to live, more than anything else.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we actually stole it from them because we figured

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
what we thought was a set of deliverables,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a timetable, and nothing else.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And a group of engineers worked in Germany,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and the idea was they would work separately

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
come together, and they would produce together

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and actually something different happened. They went other places.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and six or seven apartments,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And -- at least they told me it was her house,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
some had left their wives behind and families behind,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and they literally lived in this house

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
for the entire six months the project was in America,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but the first three months were the most intensive.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And one of the young women in the project,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it's quite fascinating.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So my concept of what a design studio was probably --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
However, the engineers back in Munich

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and they were trying to find how many cup holders

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and this collusion of incredible creativity,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
under these incredible surroundings,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
would create some incredible solutions.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that they cannot bring this together at all.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
they would present it all to Dr. Goschel --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they would present their results.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We would see where we were going,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
we would see the first indication of what could be

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
but somehow all this is going to come together,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and I'm going to see some really great product.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So we went to Tiburon, after three months,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and the team had gotten together the week before,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
many days ahead of time.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and they put their presentation together.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And they hadn't done anything because --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and we were asking them to create a problem.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the engineers showed up with nothing.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And the engineers told the designers,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
we'll walk right out of the project."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So I didn't know any of this,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
There was a whole lot of dialog.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that needs to be built between engineers and designers.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And if you can imagine what this is like,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and they're doing all this stuff.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
You're letting me down, you're my designers,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
you're supposed to be the creative ones,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
what the hell is going on around here?"

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
how could they take BMW's money,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and they'd decided not to show me anything,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
because they hadn't realized, of course,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that they couldn't do problem creating.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So we went to lunch --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
(Laughter)

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
The engineers all sat at one end of the table,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
That's what you get furious about right?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
did she fly out with me or something?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and it's two times less than last month,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
so that means you don't love me as much.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
This cannot be."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I said "This can't be."

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And I think we felt much closer that day,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I think, truly back into the center of the process.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
for the next model of what would be the proposal

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
for the next generation after SUVs in America.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It was the rendition of our motorcycle,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,"

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
There's a lot to be said about trust and love,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
and it's stayed that way ever since.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Thanks so much.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
(Applause)
