00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.374
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors
were insignificant animals.

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:22.497
The most important thing to know
about prehistoric humans

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.473
is that they were unimportant.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:29.631
Their impact on the world was not
much greater than that of jellyfish

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.016
or fireflies or woodpeckers.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:36.226
Today, in contrast,
we control this planet.

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.195
And the question is:

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.341
How did we come from there to here?

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.318
How did we turn ourselves
from insignificant apes,

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:48.489
minding their own business
in a corner of Africa,

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:51.003
into the rulers of planet Earth?

00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:57.566
Usually, we look for the difference
between us and all the other animals

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.071
on the individual level.

00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:02.406
We want to believe -- I want to believe --

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.978
that there is something special about me,

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.128
about my body, about my brain,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:14.435
that makes me so superior
to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.482
But the truth is that,
on the individual level,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:21.537
I'm embarrassingly similar
to a chimpanzee.

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:27.264
And if you take me and a chimpanzee
and put us together on some lonely island,

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:31.536
and we had to struggle for survival
to see who survives better,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.776
I would definitely place my bet
on the chimpanzee, not on myself.

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.445
And this is not something
wrong with me personally.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.595
I guess if they took almost any one
of you, and placed you alone

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.584
with a chimpanzee on some island,

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:49.075
the chimpanzee would do much better.

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:55.008
The real difference between humans
and all other animals

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.479
is not on the individual level;

00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:59.105
it's on the collective level.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:04.324
Humans control the planet
because they are the only animals

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:09.525
that can cooperate both flexibly
and in very large numbers.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:11.935
Now, there are other animals --

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.130
like the social insects,
the bees, the ants --

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:19.726
that can cooperate in large numbers,
but they don't do so flexibly.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.536
Their cooperation is very rigid.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:27.191
There is basically just one way
in which a beehive can function.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:31.026
And if there's a new opportunity
or a new danger,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.593
the bees cannot reinvent
the social system overnight.

00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:38.497
They cannot, for example,
execute the queen

00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:40.427
and establish a republic of bees,

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.553
or a communist dictatorship
of worker bees.

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.785
Other animals, like the social mammals --

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.683
the wolves, the elephants,
the dolphins, the chimpanzees --

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.453
they can cooperate much more flexibly,

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:56.818
but they do so only in small numbers,

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.715
because cooperation among chimpanzees

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.787
is based on intimate knowledge,
one of the other.

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:06.579
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.406
and I want to cooperate with you.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.025
I need to know you personally.

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.819
What kind of chimpanzee are you?

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:14.256
Are you a nice chimpanzee?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.933
Are you an evil chimpanzee?

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:17.401
Are you trustworthy?

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.478
If I don't know you, how can I
cooperate with you?

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:25.427
The only animal that can combine
the two abilities together

00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:30.747
and cooperate both flexibly
and still do so in very large numbers

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:32.401
is us, Homo sapiens.

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:37.104
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:39.697
chimpanzees might be better than us.

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:45.291
But, if you pit 1,000 humans
against 1,000 chimpanzees,

00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:48.933
the humans will win easily,
for the simple reason

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:52.690
that a thousand chimpanzees
cannot cooperate at all.

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:57.388
And if you now try to cram
100,000 chimpanzees

00:03:57.412 --> 00:04:01.028
into Oxford Street,
or into Wembley Stadium,

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:03.584
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:06.225
you will get chaos, complete chaos.

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.108
Just imagine Wembley Stadium
with 100,000 chimpanzees.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:11.806
Complete madness.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:18.161
In contrast, humans normally
gather there in tens of thousands,

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:21.249
and what we get is not chaos, usually.

00:04:21.273 --> 00:04:27.360
What we get is extremely sophisticated
and effective networks of cooperation.

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:33.144
All the huge achievements
of humankind throughout history,

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:36.451
whether it's building the pyramids
or flying to the moon,

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.050
have been based not
on individual abilities,

00:04:39.074 --> 00:04:42.899
but on this ability to cooperate
flexibly in large numbers.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:47.122
Think even about this very talk
that I'm giving now:

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:53.130
I'm standing here in front of an audience
of about 300 or 400 people,

00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:56.278
most of you are complete strangers to me.

00:04:56.928 --> 00:05:01.912
Similarly, I don't really know
all the people who have organized

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:03.563
and worked on this event.

00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:07.787
I don't know the pilot
and the crew members of the plane

00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:10.722
that brought me over here,
yesterday, to London.

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:15.009
I don't know the people
who invented and manufactured

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:19.543
this microphone and these cameras,
which are recording what I'm saying.

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:23.660
I don't know the people
who wrote all the books and articles

00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:26.077
that I read in preparation for this talk.

00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:29.305
And I certainly don't know all the people

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.548
who might be watching this talk
over the Internet,

00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:35.599
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:39.671
Nevertheless, even though
we don't know each other,

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:45.548
we can work together to create
this global exchange of ideas.

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:49.132
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:50.970
They communicate, of course,

00:05:50.994 --> 00:05:56.793
but you will never catch a chimpanzee
traveling to some distant chimpanzee band

00:05:56.817 --> 00:06:00.937
to give them a talk about bananas
or about elephants,

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.969
or anything else that might
interest chimpanzees.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.879
Now cooperation is, of course,
not always nice;

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:12.928
all the horrible things humans
have been doing throughout history --

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:15.691
and we have been doing
some very horrible things --

00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:20.864
all those things are also based
on large-scale cooperation.

00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:23.484
Prisons are a system of cooperation;

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.498
slaughterhouses are a system
of cooperation;

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:29.526
concentration camps
are a system of cooperation.

00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:35.087
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses
and prisons and concentration camps.

00:06:36.183 --> 00:06:40.013
Now suppose I've managed
to convince you perhaps that yes,

00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:45.095
we control the world because we can
cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:48.464
The next question that immediately arises

00:06:48.488 --> 00:06:51.371
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.679
How, exactly, do we do it?

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:59.865
What enables us alone, of all the animals,
to cooperate in such a way?

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:04.260
The answer is our imagination.

00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:10.430
We can cooperate flexibly
with countless numbers of strangers,

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:14.150
because we alone, of all
the animals on the planet,

00:07:14.174 --> 00:07:18.797
can create and believe fictions,
fictional stories.

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:23.914
And as long as everybody believes
in the same fiction,

00:07:23.938 --> 00:07:27.480
everybody obeys and follows
the same rules,

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.793
the same norms, the same values.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.538
All other animals use
their communication system

00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:37.058
only to describe reality.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.807
A chimpanzee may say, "Look!
There's a lion, let's run away!"

00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.937
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree
over there! Let's go and get bananas!"

00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:52.238
Humans, in contrast, use their language
not merely to describe reality,

00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:56.786
but also to create new realities,
fictional realities.

00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:01.232
A human can say, "Look,
there is a god above the clouds!

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:03.336
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.565
when you die, God will punish you
and send you to hell."

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.758
And if you all believe this story
that I've invented,

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:14.597
then you will follow the same
norms and laws and values,

00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:15.913
and you can cooperate.

00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.628
This is something only humans can do.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:23.048
You can never convince a chimpanzee
to give you a banana

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:26.865
by promising him, "... after you die,
you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:27.912
(Laughter)

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:31.198
"... and you'll receive lots and lots
of bananas for your good deeds.

00:08:31.222 --> 00:08:32.644
So now give me this banana."

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:35.426
No chimpanzee will ever
believe such a story.

00:08:35.776 --> 00:08:38.466
Only humans believe such stories,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.573
which is why we control the world,

00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:45.442
whereas the chimpanzees are locked up
in zoos and research laboratories.

00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:49.844
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:56.008
in the religious field, humans cooperate
by believing in the same fictions.

00:08:56.032 --> 00:09:00.984
Millions of people come together
to build a cathedral or a mosque

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:06.750
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because
they all believe in the same stories

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:09.487
about God and heaven and hell.

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:15.218
But what I want to emphasize
is that exactly the same mechanism

00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:21.106
underlies all other forms
of mass-scale human cooperation,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.650
not only in the religious field.

00:09:23.674 --> 00:09:25.952
Take, for example, the legal field.

00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:32.508
Most legal systems today in the world
are based on a belief in human rights.

00:09:33.247 --> 00:09:35.024
But what are human rights?

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:40.298
Human rights, just like God and heaven,
are just a story that we've invented.

00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:42.640
They are not an objective reality;

00:09:42.664 --> 00:09:46.330
they are not some biological effect
about homo sapiens.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:50.518
Take a human being,
cut him open, look inside,

00:09:50.542 --> 00:09:55.669
you will find the heart, the kidneys,
neurons, hormones, DNA,

00:09:55.693 --> 00:09:57.581
but you won't find any rights.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.121
The only place you find rights
are in the stories

00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:06.278
that we have invented and spread around
over the last few centuries.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:11.537
They may be very positive stories,
very good stories,

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:15.124
but they're still just fictional stories
that we've invented.

00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:18.184
The same is true of the political field.

00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:24.935
The most important factors
in modern politics are states and nations.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.133
But what are states and nations?

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.718
They are not an objective reality.

00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:32.455
A mountain is an objective reality.

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:35.763
You can see it, you can touch it,
you can even smell it.

00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:37.995
But a nation or a state,

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:41.799
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,

00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:44.563
this is just a story that we've invented

00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:46.561
and became extremely attached to.

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:49.453
The same is true of the economic field.

00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:53.598
The most important actors today
in the global economy

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:55.884
are companies and corporations.

00:10:56.407 --> 00:11:00.138
Many of you today, perhaps, work
for a corporation,

00:11:00.162 --> 00:11:03.212
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.

00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:05.395
What exactly are these things?

00:11:05.982 --> 00:11:09.929
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:13.835
They are stories invented and maintained

00:11:13.859 --> 00:11:17.192
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:18.661
(Laughter)

00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:22.104
And what do corporations do all day?

00:11:22.128 --> 00:11:24.981
Mostly, they try to make money.

00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.744
Yet, what is money?

00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:31.934
Again, money is not an objective reality;
it has no objective value.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.275
Take this green piece
of paper, the dollar bill.

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:37.676
Look at it -- it has no value.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.934
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.250
you cannot wear it.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:45.674
But then came along
these master storytellers --

00:11:45.698 --> 00:11:47.182
the big bankers,

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.646
the finance ministers,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.024
the prime ministers --

00:11:50.048 --> 00:11:52.526
and they tell us a very convincing story:

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.508
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?

00:11:54.532 --> 00:11:57.115
It is actually worth 10 bananas."

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:59.700
And if I believe it, and you believe it,

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.240
and everybody believes it,

00:12:01.264 --> 00:12:03.128
it actually works.

00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:06.065
I can take this worthless piece of paper,

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:07.726
go to the supermarket,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.757
give it to a complete stranger
whom I've never met before,

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:16.466
and get, in exchange, real bananas
which I can actually eat.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.591
This is something amazing.

00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:20.693
You could never do it with chimpanzees.

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:22.662
Chimpanzees trade, of course:

00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:25.436
"Yes, you give me a coconut,
I'll give you a banana."

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.698
That can work.

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:29.714
But, you give me
a worthless piece of paper

00:12:29.738 --> 00:12:31.752
and you except me to give you a banana?

00:12:31.776 --> 00:12:32.928
No way!

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.533
What do you think I am, a human?

00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:36.930
(Laughter)

00:12:36.954 --> 00:12:41.073
Money, in fact, is
the most successful story

00:12:41.097 --> 00:12:43.753
ever invented and told by humans,

00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:48.120
because it is the only story
everybody believes.

00:12:48.692 --> 00:12:51.482
Not everybody believes in God,

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:54.531
not everybody believes in human rights,

00:12:54.555 --> 00:12:57.340
not everybody believes in nationalism,

00:12:57.364 --> 00:13:01.107
but everybody believes in money,
and in the dollar bill.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.495
Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:07.206
He hated American politics
and American religion

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.679
and American culture,

00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:11.509
but he had no objection
to American dollars.

00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:13.628
He was quite fond of them, actually.

00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:15.555
(Laughter)

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:17.866
To conclude, then:

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.658
We humans control the world
because we live in a dual reality.

00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:28.444
All other animals live
in an objective reality.

00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:33.544
Their reality consists
of objective entities,

00:13:33.568 --> 00:13:37.511
like rivers and trees
and lions and elephants.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.750
We humans, we also live
in an objective reality.

00:13:41.774 --> 00:13:46.842
In our world, too, there are rivers
and trees and lions and elephants.

00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:49.266
But over the centuries,

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.017
we have constructed on top
of this objective reality

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:57.534
a second layer of fictional reality,

00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:01.122
a reality made of fictional entities,

00:14:01.146 --> 00:14:05.679
like nations, like gods,
like money, like corporations.

00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:11.115
And what is amazing is that
as history unfolded,

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:16.535
this fictional reality became
more and more powerful

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:21.060
so that today, the most powerful
forces in the world

00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:23.049
are these fictional entities.

00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:30.509
Today, the very survival of rivers
and trees and lions and elephants

00:14:30.533 --> 00:14:35.638
depends on the decisions and wishes
of fictional entities,

00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:40.199
like the United States, like Google,
like the World Bank --

00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:44.262
entities that exist only
in our own imagination.

00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:46.081
Thank you.

00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:50.676
(Applause)

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:58.509
Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have
a new book out.

00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:00.336
After Sapiens, you wrote another one,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.947
and it's out in Hebrew, but not
yet translated into ...

00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:05.900
Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on
the translation as we speak.

00:15:05.924 --> 00:15:08.092
BG: In the book, if I
understand it correctly,

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:13.745
you argue that the amazing breakthroughs
that we are experiencing right now

00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:16.028
not only will potentially
make our lives better,

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:18.288
but they will create -- and I quote you --

00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:22.930
"... new classes and new class struggles,
just as the industrial revolution did."

00:15:22.954 --> 00:15:24.177
Can you elaborate for us?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.594
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:31.520
we saw the creation of a new class
of the urban proletariat.

00:15:31.544 --> 00:15:36.654
And much of the political and social
history of the last 200 years involved

00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:40.304
what to do with this class,
and the new problems and opportunities.

00:15:40.328 --> 00:15:44.960
Now, we see the creation of a new
massive class of useless people.

00:15:44.984 --> 00:15:45.985
(Laughter)

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:51.370
As computers become better and better
in more and more fields,

00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:56.286
there is a distinct possibility that
computers will out-perform us

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.913
in most tasks and will make
humans redundant.

00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:02.674
And then the big political
and economic question

00:16:02.698 --> 00:16:05.061
of the 21st century will be,

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:07.247
"What do we need humans for?",

00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:10.638
or at least, "What do we need
so many humans for?"

00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:13.120
BG: Do you have an answer in the book?

00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:17.164
YNH: At present, the best guess
we have is to keep them happy

00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:18.985
with drugs and computer games ...

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:20.010
(Laughter)

00:16:20.034 --> 00:16:23.305
but this doesn't sound
like a very appealing future.

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:26.138
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying
in the book and now,

00:16:26.162 --> 00:16:28.948
that for all the discussion
about the growing evidence

00:16:28.972 --> 00:16:32.735
of significant economic inequality,
we are just kind of at the beginning

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:33.916
of the process?

00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:35.751
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;

00:16:35.775 --> 00:16:39.718
it's seeing all kinds
of possibilities before us.

00:16:39.742 --> 00:16:44.724
One possibility is this creation
of a new massive class of useless people.

00:16:44.748 --> 00:16:47.888
Another possibility is
the division of humankind

00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:50.903
into different biological castes,

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:55.218
with the rich being upgraded
into virtual gods,

00:16:55.242 --> 00:16:59.550
and the poor being degraded
to this level of useless people.

00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:02.596
BG: I feel there is another TED talk
coming up in a year or two.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.442
Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.

00:17:04.466 --> 00:17:05.622
YNH: Thanks!

00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:07.311
(Applause)
