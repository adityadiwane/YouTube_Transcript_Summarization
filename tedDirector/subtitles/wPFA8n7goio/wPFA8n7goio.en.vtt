00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
the overwhelming complexity

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and richness that we experience at the conference

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
in a project called Big Viz.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
that were made by two visual artists.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
David Sibbet from The Grove,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
made 650 sketches that strive to capture

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
the essence of each presenter's ideas.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
And the consensus was: it really worked.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
These sketches brought to life the key ideas,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
the portraits, the magic moments

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
that we all experienced last year.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
What is it about animation,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
And this is an important question to ask and answer

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
the better we can communicate,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
So this year we're going to visualize how

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
the brain visualizes.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
doesn't actually see the world as it is,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
but instead, creates a series of mental models

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
through a collection of "Ah-ha moments,"

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
or moments of discovery, through various processes.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
at the primary visual cortex.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160
just the simplest of shapes.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
But it also acts like a kind of relay station

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
that re-radiates and redirects information

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
to many other parts of the brain.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
We're only going to talk about three of them.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
So the first one is called the ventral stream.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
It's on this side of the brain.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.160
It's the "what" detector.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.160
Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
So that's the part of the brain that is activated

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
when you give a word to something.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
And what it does is locates the object

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
in physical body space.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
So if you look around the stage here

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
The third part that I'd like to talk about

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
is the limbic system.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160
And it's the part that feels.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160
and you go, "Oh! I have a strong

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.160
or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
So the combination of these processing centers

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.160
help us make meaning in very different ways.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
So what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Well, again, the schematic view

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
asking a whole bunch of questions

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
to create a unified mental model.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.160
So, for example, when you look at this image

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
a good graphic invites the eye to dart around,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
to selectively create a visual logic.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.160
So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
It's the selective logic.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
where we quite literally create an infinite wall.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.160
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
enriches meaning.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.160
It activates a different part of the brain.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160
And then the limbic system

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
is activated when we see motion, when we see color,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160
that we've heard about before.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
So the point of this is what?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
We make meaning by seeing,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
by an act of visual interrogation.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
The lessons for us are three-fold.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.160
First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Secondly make those images interactive

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
so that we engage much more fully.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And the third is to augment memory

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
by creating a visual persistence.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
These are techniques that can be used to be --

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
So the low-tech version looks like this.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
And, by the way, this is the way in which

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
we develop and formulate

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160
strategy within Autodesk,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.160
in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.160
What we literally do is have the teams

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160
draw out the entire strategic plan

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
on one giant wall.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
There's always a room, always a place

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
to be able to make sense of all of the components

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160
in the strategic plan.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
This is a time-lapse view of it.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.160
You'll be able to figure that out. (Laughter)

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
So the act of collectively and collaboratively

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160
building the image

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
transforms the collaboration.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160
No Powerpoint is used in two days.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
But instead the entire team

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
creates a shared mental model

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
that they can all agree on and move forward on.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
And this can be enhanced and augmented with

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
some emerging digital technology.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
And this is our great unveiling for today.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
And this is an emerging set of technologies

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
that use large-screen displays

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160
with intelligent calculation in the background

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.160
to make the invisible visible.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.160
Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160
So a team can actually look at

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
all the key components that heat the structure

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
and make choices and then see the end result

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
that is visualized on this screen.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.160
So making images meaningful has three components.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160
The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.160
Secondly, making them interactive.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
And then thirdly, making them persistent.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
And I believe that these three principles

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.160
can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
that we face in the world today. Thanks so much.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
(Applause)
