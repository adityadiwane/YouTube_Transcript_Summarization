00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:17.125
I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:18.835
Because of the coup d'état,

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:21.962
my family had to leave my native home of Ghana

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:24.178
and move to the Gambia.

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.899
As luck would have it,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.632
six months after we arrived,

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:30.703
they too had a military coup.

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:33.121
I vividly remember being woken
up in the middle of the night

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.348
and gathering the few belongings we could

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.297
and walking for about two hours

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:40.343
to a safe house.

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:43.175
For a week, we slept under our beds

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.956
because we were worried that bullets
might fly through the window.

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:50.138
Then, at the age of eight,

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:52.265
we moved to Botswana.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.458
This time, it was different.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:56.292
There were no coups.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.335
Everything worked. Great education.

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:02.310
They had such good infrastructure
that even at the time they had

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.211
a fiber-optic telephone system,

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.260
long before it had reached Western countries.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.349
The only thing they didn't have

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:12.679
is that they didn't have

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.329
their own national television station,

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.220
and so I remember watching

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.705
TV from neighboring South Africa,

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.326
and watching Nelson Mandela in jail

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:24.621
being offered a chance to come out

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.501
if he would give up the apartheid struggle.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:28.616
But he didn't. He refused to do that

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.464
until he actually achieved his objective

00:01:30.464 --> 00:01:33.676
of freeing South Africa from apartheid.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:37.709
And I remember feeling how just one good leader

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.557
could make such a big difference in Africa.

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.830
Then at the age of 12,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.170
my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.747
Initially, this too was amazing:

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:56.933
growing economy, excellent infrastructure,

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.969
and it seemed like it was a model

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.658
for economic development in Africa.

00:02:01.658 --> 00:02:03.649
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.070
and I went off to college.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.161
Six years later, I returned to the country.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.145
Everything was different.

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:14.396
It had shattered into pieces.

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:17.606
Millions of people had emigrated,

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:19.413
the economy was in a shambles,

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:21.004
and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.889
of development had been wiped out.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.377
How could a country go so bad so fast?

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:28.990
Most people would agree

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.178
that it's all because of leadership.

00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:34.958
One man, President Robert Mugabe,

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.168
is almost single-handedly responsible

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:39.515
for having destroyed this country.

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:41.244
Now, all these experiences of living in different

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.675
parts of Africa growing up

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:45.497
did two things to me.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:49.776
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.699
Everywhere I went,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.377
I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent

00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:57.534
and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,

00:02:57.534 --> 00:02:59.461
and at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate

00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:04.242
the rest of my life to making this continent great.

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:06.144
But I also realized that making Africa great

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.461
would require addressing this issue of leadership.

00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.632
You see, all these countries I lived in,

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.624
the coups d'état

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:16.683
and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:19.405
and in Zimbabwe,

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.858
contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:28.412
in Botswana and in South 
Africa of good leadership.

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:32.495
It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:36.174
because of the quality of our leaders.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.423
Now, one might think, of course,

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:41.191
leadership matters everywhere.

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:45.421
But if there's one thing you take
away from my talk today, it is this:

00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.550
In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.876
the difference that just one good leader can make

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:55.435
is much greater than anywhere 
else, and here's why.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.225
It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,

00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:00.903
like the judiciary, the constitution,

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:04.094
civil society and so forth.

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:07.944
So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:

00:04:07.944 --> 00:04:10.711
When societies have strong institutions,

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:13.973
the difference that one good
leader can make is limited,

00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:16.180
but when you have weak institutions,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.910
then just one good leader

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.058
can make or break that country.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:23.366
Let me make it a bit more concrete.

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:26.415
You become the president of the United States.

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:28.687
You think, "Wow, I've arrived.

00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:31.750
I'm the most powerful man in the world."

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.436
So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:36.978
All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder

00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:40.111
and says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."

00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.820
You say, "Let me try this way."

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.273
The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,

00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:47.101
we don't think you can do that."

00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:49.744
You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.

00:04:49.744 --> 00:04:52.399
I think the economy needs a stimulus."

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.894
The central bank governor will think you're crazy.

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:57.000
You might get impeached for that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.307
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.440
and you say, "You know, I really like this job.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.225
I think I'd like to stay in it forever."
(Laughter)

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:10.070
Well, you just can.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.550
You decide you want to print money.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.453
You call the central bank governor and you say,

00:05:14.453 --> 00:05:16.785
"Please double the money supply."

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:18.226
He'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:21.770
is there anything else I can do for you?"

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.609
This is the power that African leaders have,

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:29.127
and this is why they make the most difference

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:31.581
on the continent.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.626
The good news is that

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:36.464
the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:39.206
We've had three generations 
of leaders, in my mind.

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.434
Generation one are those who appeared

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:42.976
in the '50s and '60s.

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.414
These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:47.827
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.432
The legacy they left is that they
brought independence to Africa.

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:51.737
They freed us from colonialism,

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.121
and let's give them credit for that.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.133
They were followed by generation two.

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:59.183
These are people that brought nothing

00:05:59.183 --> 00:06:01.320
but havoc to Africa.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.750
Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.783
This is the stereotype of 
the typical African leader

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.178
that we typically think of:

00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:10.184
Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,

00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:12.565
Sani Abacha from Nigeria.

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.741
The good news is that most of
these leaders have moved on,

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.845
and they were replaced by generation three.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.161
These are people like the late Nelson Mandela

00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:22.175
and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,

00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:24.852
like Paul Kagame and so forth.

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:27.960
Now these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.605
but the one thing they have done is that they have

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:32.603
cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:34.061
They've stopped the fighting,

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:37.160
and I call them the stabilizer generation.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.110
They're much more accountable to their people,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.305
they've improved macroeconomic policies,

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:44.240
and we are seeing for the first time

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.580
Africa's growing, and in 
fact it's the second fastest

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.425
growing economic region in the world.

00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:50.591
So these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:51.923
but they are by and large

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:56.749
the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.628
So where to from here?

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.844
I believe that the next generation

00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:04.476
to come after this, generation four,

00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:07.009
has a unique opportunity

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.564
to transform the continent.

00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:11.408
Specifically, they can do two things

00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:13.534
that previous generations have not done.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.716
The first thing they need to do

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:18.144
is they need to create prosperity for the continent.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:20.031
Why is prosperity so important?

00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.714
Because none of the previous generations

00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:24.394
have been able to tackle this issue of poverty.

00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:25.710
Africa today

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.540
has the fastest growing population in the world,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.241
but also is the poorest.

00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.918
By 2030, Africa will have a
larger workforce than China,

00:07:34.918 --> 00:07:38.720
and by 2050, it will have the
largest workforce in the world.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.252
One billion people will need jobs in Africa,

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.626
so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:46.073
we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,

00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:49.605
not just for Africa but for the entire world.

00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:51.743
Let me show you an example

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:53.449
of one person who is living up to this legacy

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.212
of creating prosperity: Laetitia.

00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:59.203
Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya

00:07:59.203 --> 00:08:01.000
who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.910
because her family couldn't 
afford to pay fees for her.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.111
So she started her own business rearing rabbits,

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.710
which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.308
that she's from.

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:11.292
This business did so well that within a year,

00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.448
she was employing 15 women

00:08:13.448 --> 00:08:15.425
and was able to generate enough income

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:17.146
that she was able to send herself to school,

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:18.155
and through these women

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:20.862
fund another 65 children to go to school.

00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:22.564
The profits that she generated,

00:08:22.564 --> 00:08:24.149
she used that to build a school,

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:25.697
and today she educates

00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:28.238
400 children in her community.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:30.128
And she's just turned 18.

00:08:30.128 --> 00:08:34.443
(Applause)

00:08:36.857 --> 00:08:40.713
Another example is Erick Rajaonary.

00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:43.797
Erick comes from the island of Madagascar.

00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:46.596
Now, Erick realized that agriculture

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:48.260
would be the key to creating jobs

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.319
in the rural areas of Madagascar,

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:52.265
but he also realized that fertilizer was a very

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:55.596
expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.

00:08:55.596 --> 00:08:58.623
Madagascar has these very special bats

00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:00.207
that produce these droppings

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.614
that are very high in nutrients.

00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:05.989
In 2006, Erick quit his job 
as a chartered accountant

00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:07.958
and started a company to manufacture

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.144
fertilizer from the bat droppings.

00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:13.442
Today, Erick has built a business

00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:16.283
that generates several million dollars of revenue,

00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:19.116
and he employs 70 people full time

00:09:19.116 --> 00:09:20.994
and another 800 people during the season

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:23.976
when the bats drop their droppings the most.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:26.539
Now, what I like about this story

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:30.421
is that it shows that opportunities 
to create prosperity

00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.716
can be found almost anywhere.

00:09:32.716 --> 00:09:34.770
Erick is known as the Batman.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.785
(Laughter)

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:37.752
And who would have thought that you would have

00:09:37.752 --> 00:09:40.414
been able to build a multimillion-dollar business

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:44.766
employing so many people just from bat poo?

00:09:47.444 --> 00:09:51.395
The second thing that this generation needs to do

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:53.836
is to create our institutions.

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:55.651
They need to build these institutions such that we

00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.876
are never held to ransom again

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:03.330
by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.472
Now, all of this sounds great,

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:10.500
but where are we going to
get this generation four from?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.941
Do we just sit and hope that they emerge

00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:16.705
by chance, or that God gives them to us?

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.458
No, I don't think so.

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:21.610
It's too important an issue 
for us to leave it to chance.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.917
I believe that we need to create African institutions,

00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:27.628
home-grown, that will identify and develop

00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:31.379
these leaders in a systematic, practical way.

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:33.030
We've been doing this for the last 10 years

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.581
through the African Leadership Academy.

00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:38.262
Laetitia is one of our young leaders.

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:40.670
Today, we have 700 of them 
that are being groomed

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.720
for the African continent,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.795
and over the next 50 years,

00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:46.789
we expect to create 6,000 of them.

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:49.408
But one thing has been troubling me.

00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:51.500
We would get about 4,000 applications a year

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.569
for 100 young leaders that we could take

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:54.883
into this academy,

00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:56.944
and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed

00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:59.835
for this leadership training that we're offering.

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:02.951
But we couldn't satisfy it.

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:06.973
So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public

00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:11.611
an extension to this vision for
the African Leadership Academy.

00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:16.718
We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.267
that are going to cultivate this next generation

00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:20.113
of African leaders.

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:23.975
Each campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.201
so we'll be educating and developing

00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:29.015
250,000 leaders at any given time.

00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:32.738
(Applause)

00:11:36.137 --> 00:11:38.388
Over the next 50 years, this institution

00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:40.346
will create three million transformative leaders

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:42.379
for the continent.

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:44.620
My hope is that half of them

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.172
will become the entrepreneurs that we need,

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.995
who will create these jobs that we need,

00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:49.502
and the other half

00:11:49.502 --> 00:11:51.189
will go into government

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:52.388
and the nonprofit sector,

00:11:52.388 --> 00:11:56.010
and they will build the institutions that we need.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.400
But they won't just learn academics.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.190
They will also learn how to become leaders,

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.074
and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.

00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:07.938
So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,

00:12:07.938 --> 00:12:11.220
but instead of getting admitted
because of your SAT scores

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.101
or because of how much money you have

00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:14.303
or which family you come from,

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:17.225
the main criteria for getting into this university

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:19.199
will be what is the potential that you have

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:22.461
for transforming Africa?

00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:25.970
But what we're doing is 
just one group of institutions.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.060
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.762
My hope

00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:33.900
is that many, many other home-grown

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.318
African institutions will blossom,

00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:39.020
and these institutions will all come together

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.480
with a common vision of developing

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.363
this next generation of African leaders,

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.296
generation four,

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.760
and they will teach them this common message:

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.540
create jobs, build our institutions.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.790
Nelson Mandela once said,

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.592
"Every now and then,

00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:59.828
a generation is called upon to be great.

00:12:59.828 --> 00:13:03.036
You can be that great generation."

00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:06.588
I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate

00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:09.561
the next generation of African leaders,

00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:12.336
then this generation four that is coming up

00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:15.768
will be the greatest generation that Africa

00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:20.180
and indeed the entire world has ever seen.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.212
Thank you.

00:13:22.212 --> 00:13:25.797
(Applause)
