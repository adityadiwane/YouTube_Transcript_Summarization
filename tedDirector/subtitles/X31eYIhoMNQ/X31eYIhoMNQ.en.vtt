00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.632
What I want to talk to you about today

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:22.236
is some of the problems that the military
of the Western world --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.997
Australia, United States,
the UK and so on --

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.151
face in some of the deployments
that they're dealing with

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.079
in the modern world at this time.

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:31.927
If you think about the sorts of things

00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:35.048
we've sent Australian military
personnel to in recent years,

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:37.465
we've got obvious things
like Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.657
but you've also got things like
East Timor and the Solomon Islands,

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.834
and so on.

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:43.294
And a lot of these deployments

00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:46.452
that we're sending
military personnel to these days

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.155
aren't traditional wars.

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:52.700
In fact, a lot of the jobs
we're asking military personnel to do

00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:53.875
in those situations

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.475
are ones that, in their own countries --
Australia, the US and so on --

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.868
would actually be done by police officers.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.920
So there's a bunch
of problems that come up

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:03.952
for military personnel
in these situations,

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:07.227
because they're doing things
they haven't really been trained for.

00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:12.063
And they're doing things that those
who do them in their own countries

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:15.742
are trained very differently for
and equipped very differently for.

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:19.429
Now, there's a bunch of reasons
why we send military personnel,

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:21.286
rather than police, to do these jobs.

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:24.236
If Australia had to send
1,000 people tomorrow

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.035
to West Papua, for example,

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:30.886
we don't have 1,000 police officers
hanging around that could go tomorrow,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.068
and we do have
1,000 soldiers that could go.

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.171
So when we have to send someone,
we send the military --

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.772
they're there, they're available,

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.529
and heck, they're used to going off
and doing these things

00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:41.796
and living by themselves

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.658
and not having all this extra support.

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:46.342
So they are able to do it in that sense.

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.196
But they aren't trained
the same way police officers are,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.216
and they're certainly not equipped
the way police officers are,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.432
so this has raised
a bunch of problems for them

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:55.942
when dealing with these issues.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.324
One particular thing that's come up
that I am especially interested in,

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:00.975
is the question of whether,

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.039
when we're sending military personnel
to do these sorts of jobs,

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:06.093
we ought to be equipping them differently;

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:08.982
and in particular, whether we ought
to be giving them access

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.422
to some of the nonlethal weapons
that police have.

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:13.525
Since they're doing some of the same jobs,

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.607
maybe they should have
some of those things.

00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.330
And there's a range of places you'd think
those things would be really useful.

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:21.937
For example, when you've got
military checkpoints.

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.976
If people are approaching
these checkpoints

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.625
and the military personnel are unsure
if this person's hostile or not,

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.003
say this person approaching
here, and they say,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:31.623
"Is this a suicide bomber or not?

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.613
Is something hidden under their clothes?

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:34.791
What's going to happen?"

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:37.067
They don't know if the person
is hostile or not.

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.478
If the person doesn't follow directions,
they may end up shooting them,

00:02:40.502 --> 00:02:43.717
and then find out afterwards
either, yes, we shot the right person,

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.686
or, no, this was just an innocent person

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.842
who didn't understand what was going on.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.472
So if they had nonlethal weapons,
then they would say,

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.523
"We can use them
in that sort of situation.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.435
If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.308
at least we haven't killed them."

00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:59.587
Another situation: this photo
is from one of the missions

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.404
in the Balkans in the late 1990s.

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:04.002
This situation is a little bit different,

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:05.987
where maybe they know someone is hostile;

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.729
they've got someone shooting at them

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.950
or doing something else
that's clearly hostile,

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:11.206
throwing rocks, whatever.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.381
But if they respond,

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.398
there's a range of other people around
who are innocent people,

00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:16.577
who might also get hurt.

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.828
It'd be collateral damage

00:03:17.852 --> 00:03:20.569
that the military
often doesn't want to talk about.

00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:23.352
So again, they'd say, "With access
to nonlethal weapons,

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:25.309
if we've got someone we know is hostile,

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.166
we can do something to deal with them,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.952
and know that if we hit anyone else,

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.927
at least we're not going to kill them."

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:32.787
Another suggestion has been,

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.098
since we're putting so many
robots in the field,

00:03:35.122 --> 00:03:36.392
we can see the time coming

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:39.284
where they're actually going
to send robots out in the field

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:40.462
that are autonomous.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.965
They'll make their own decisions
about who to shoot and who not to shoot,

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.331
without a human in the loop.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:46.667
So the suggestion is,

00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.805
if we're going to send robots out
and allow them to do this,

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.087
maybe it would be a good idea
if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:57.224
so if the robot makes a bad decision
and shoots the wrong person,

00:03:57.248 --> 00:03:59.326
again, they haven't actually killed them.

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:03.108
Now, there's a whole range
of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:04.733
some of which are available now,

00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:06.349
some of which they're developing.

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:08.651
You've got traditional things
like pepper spray,

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:10.156
OC spray up at the top there,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.034
or Tasers over here.

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:15.210
The one on the top right here
is actually a dazzling laser,

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.849
intended to just blind
the person momentarily

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.483
and disorient them.

00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:21.499
You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:24.942
that contain rubber pellets
instead of the traditional metal ones.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.549
And this one in the middle
here, the large truck,

00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:29.943
is called the Active Denial System,

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.587
something the US military
is working on at the moment.

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:35.587
It's essentially a big
microwave transmitter.

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:38.405
It's sort of your classic
idea of a heat ray.

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:41.836
It goes out to a really long distance,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.099
compared to any of these
other sorts of things.

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:47.949
Anybody who is hit with this
feels a sudden burst of heat,

00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:50.084
and just wants to get out of the way.

00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:52.732
It is a lot more sophisticated
than a microwave oven,

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:55.638
but it basically is boiling
the water molecules

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.614
in the very surface level of your skin.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:04:59.384
So you feel this massive heat,

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:01.820
and you go, "I want
to get out of the way."

00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.824
And they think this will be really useful

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:06.993
in places where we need to clear
a crowd out of a particular area,

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:08.466
if the crowd is being hostile.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.101
If we need to keep people
away from a particular place,

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.171
we can do that with these sorts of things.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.657
So there's a whole range
of different nonlethal weapons

00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:18.621
we could give military personnel,

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:20.552
and there's a whole range of situations

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.529
where they're looking at them and saying,

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:24.388
"These things would be really useful."

00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:25.816
But as I said,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.829
the military and the police
are very different.

00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:29.885
(Laughter)

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.640
Yes, you don't have to look
very hard at this to recognize

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.432
that they might be very different.

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:35.726
In particular,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.430
the attitude to the use of force

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:39.522
and the way they're trained to use force

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.126
is especially different.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:43.836
The police --

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.872
and knowing because I've actually
helped to train police --

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:49.634
police, particularly
in Western jurisdictions at least,

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:53.501
are trained to De-escalate force,

00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:56.470
to try and avoid using force
wherever possible,

00:05:56.494 --> 00:06:00.958
and to use lethal force
only as an absolute last resort.

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:04.277
Military personnel
are being trained for war.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.947
So they're trained that,
as soon as things go bad,

00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.491
their first response is lethal force.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.728
The moment the fecal matter
hits the rotating turbine --

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:15.784
(Laughter)

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.029
you can start shooting at people.

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:20.836
So their attitudes

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.253
to the use of lethal force
are very different,

00:06:23.277 --> 00:06:24.896
and I think it's fairly obvious

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.836
that their attitude to the use
of nonlethal weapons

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.955
would also be very different
from what it is with the police.

00:06:31.437 --> 00:06:33.538
And since we've already had
so many problems

00:06:33.562 --> 00:06:36.183
with police use of nonlethal
weapons in various ways,

00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:39.285
I thought it would be a good idea
to look at some of those things

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.130
and relate it to the military context.

00:06:41.154 --> 00:06:44.836
I was very surprised when I started
to do this to see that, in fact,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.491
even the people who advocated the use
of nonlethal weapons by the military

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:49.836
hadn't actually done that.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.389
They generally seemed to think,

00:06:51.413 --> 00:06:53.965
"Why would we care
what's happened with the police?

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:55.811
We're looking at something different,"

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:57.247
and didn't seem to recognize

00:06:57.271 --> 00:06:59.718
they were looking at pretty
much the same stuff.

00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:02.526
So I started to investigate
some of those issues,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.303
and have a look at the way
police use nonlethal weapons

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:07.485
when they're introduced,

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.836
and some of the problems that might
arise out of those sorts of things

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.887
when they actually do introduce them.

00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.470
And of course, being Australian,

00:07:15.494 --> 00:07:19.262
I started looking at stuff in Australia,
knowing from my own experience

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:23.102
of various times when nonlethal weapons
have been introduced in Australia.

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:26.592
One of the things I particularly
looked at was the use of OC spray --

00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:29.129
oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray --

00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:31.085
by Australian police,

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:33.920
and seeing what had happened
when that had been introduced,

00:07:33.944 --> 00:07:35.423
and those sorts of issues.

00:07:35.447 --> 00:07:38.553
And one study that I found,
a particularly interesting one,

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:40.474
was in Queensland,

00:07:40.498 --> 00:07:43.923
because they had a trial period
for the use of pepper spray

00:07:43.947 --> 00:07:46.397
before they actually
introduced it more broadly.

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:49.841
And I went and had a look
at some of the figures here.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.372
Now, when they introduced
OC spray in Queensland,

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:53.968
they were really explicit.

00:07:53.992 --> 00:07:57.488
The police minister's and a heap
of public statements were made about it.

00:07:57.512 --> 00:08:00.905
They were saying, "This is explicitly
intended to give police an option

00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:03.048
between shouting and shooting.

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.836
This is something they can use
instead of a firearm

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.129
in situations where they would have
previously had to shoot someone."

00:08:10.153 --> 00:08:12.836
So I looked at all
of the police shooting figures.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.956
And you can't actually
find them very easily

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.836
for individual Australian states;

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.376
I could only find these.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.199
This is from an Australian Institute
of Criminology report.

00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:23.231
You can see, in the fine print at the top:

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:26.480
"Police shooting deaths"
means not just people shot by police,

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:29.534
but people who have shot themselves
in the presence of police.

00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:32.009
But these are the figures
across the entire country,

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:35.137
and the red arrow represents
the point where Queensland said,

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:37.055
"Yes, this is where we're going to give

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.219
all police officers
across the entire state

00:08:39.243 --> 00:08:40.746
access to OC spray."

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.836
So you can see there were six deaths
sort of leading up to it,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.931
every year for a number of years.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:47.836
There was a spike a few years before,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.702
but that wasn't actually Queensland.

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.357
Anyone know where that was?

00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:53.002
Wasn't Port Arthur, no.

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:55.104
Victoria? Yes, correct.

00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:57.105
That spike was all Victoria.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:58.280
(Laughter)

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.868
So it wasn't that Queensland
had a particular problem

00:09:00.892 --> 00:09:03.587
with deaths from police
shootings and so on.

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:06.024
So, six shootings
across the whole country,

00:09:06.048 --> 00:09:08.085
fairly consistently over the years before.

00:09:08.109 --> 00:09:11.061
The next two years were the years
they studied -- 2001, 2002.

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:13.997
Anyone want to take a stab
at the number of times,

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:15.677
given how they've introduced this,

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:19.169
the number of times police in Queensland
used OC spray in that period?

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:21.299
Hundreds? One? Three?

00:09:21.685 --> 00:09:23.204
A thousand is getting better.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:29.717
Explicitly introduced as an alternative
to the use of lethal force --

00:09:29.741 --> 00:09:32.455
an alternative between
shouting and shooting.

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:34.456
I'm going to go out on a limb here

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.768
and say that if Queensland police
didn't have OC spray,

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:40.573
they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people

00:09:40.597 --> 00:09:41.968
in those two years.

00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:43.191
(Laughter)

00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:47.681
In fact, if you have a look
at the studies they were looking at,

00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:50.987
the material they were
collecting and examining,

00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:55.623
you can see the suspects were only armed
in about 15 percent of cases

00:09:55.647 --> 00:09:57.224
where OC spray was used.

00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:00.717
It was routinely being
used in this period,

00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:02.860
and, of course, still is routinely used --

00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:05.266
because there were no complaints about it,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.388
not within the context
of this study, anyway --

00:10:08.412 --> 00:10:12.224
it was routinely being used
to deal with people who were violent,

00:10:12.248 --> 00:10:13.951
who were potentially violent,

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:16.292
and also quite frequently used

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:19.467
to deal with people who were
simply passively noncompliant.

00:10:21.482 --> 00:10:23.567
This person is not doing anything violent,

00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:25.676
but they just won't do
what we want them to.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.213
They're not obeying
the directions we're giving them,

00:10:28.237 --> 00:10:31.389
so we'll give them a shot
of the OC spray -- that'll speed them up.

00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:33.482
Everything will work out better that way.

00:10:33.964 --> 00:10:36.368
This was something explicitly introduced

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:38.224
to be an alternative to firearms,

00:10:38.248 --> 00:10:40.225
but it's being routinely used

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:43.233
to deal with a whole range
of other sorts of problems.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.050
Now one of the particular
issues that comes up

00:10:46.074 --> 00:10:48.836
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.779
and people actually say,
"There might be some problems" --

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:54.836
there's a couple of particular
problems that get focused on.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:11:00.372
One of those problems is: nonlethal
weapons may be used indiscriminately.

00:11:00.396 --> 00:11:03.617
One of the fundamental principles
of military use of force

00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:05.409
is that you have to be discriminate;

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:08.186
you have to be careful
about who you're shooting at.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.836
So one of the problems suggested
with nonlethal weapons

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.051
is that they might be used
indiscriminately --

00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.711
that you would use them
against a whole range of people,

00:11:15.735 --> 00:11:18.040
because you don't have
to worry so much anymore.

00:11:18.064 --> 00:11:21.675
And in fact, one particular instance
where I think that actually happens

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:24.557
was the Dubrovka Theater
siege in Moscow in 2002,

00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:27.596
which probably a lot of you,
unlike most of my students at ADFA,

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.213
are old enough to remember.

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:31.998
So, Chechens had come in
and taken control of the theater.

00:11:32.022 --> 00:11:35.330
They were holding something
like 700 people hostage.

00:11:35.354 --> 00:11:36.984
They'd released a bunch of people,

00:11:37.008 --> 00:11:39.374
but they still had
about 700 people hostage.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:44.836
And the Russian military police
special forces, "Spetsnaz,"

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.836
came in and stormed the theater.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.303
The way they did it was to pump
the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.

00:11:50.327 --> 00:11:54.929
And it turned out
that lots of the hostages died

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:56.868
as a result of inhaling the gas.

00:11:57.741 --> 00:11:59.836
It was used indiscriminately.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.257
They pumped the whole theater
full of the gas.

00:12:02.749 --> 00:12:05.439
And it's no surprise that people died,

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:08.836
because you don't know how much gas
each person is going to inhale,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.755
what position they'll fall in when
they become unconscious, and so on.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:15.836
There were, in fact,
only a couple of people who got shot

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.304
in this episode.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.836
So when they had a look at it afterward,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.802
there were only a couple of people
who'd apparently been shot,

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.702
by the hostage takers
or by the police forces

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:27.732
trying to deal with the situation.

00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:29.463
Virtually everybody that got killed

00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:31.908
got killed from inhaling the gas.

00:12:32.383 --> 00:12:35.711
The final toll of hostages
is a little unclear,

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.663
but it's certainly a few more than that,

00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:39.976
because other people died
over the next few days.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.047
So this was one problem they talked about,

00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:43.935
that it might be used indiscriminately.

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:46.204
A second problem
people sometimes talk about

00:12:46.228 --> 00:12:48.196
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.099
and it's actually why,
in the chemical weapons convention,

00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:53.696
it's very clear that you can't use
riot-control agents

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.009
as weapons of warfare --

00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:59.062
is that it's seen that sometimes
nonlethal weapons might be used

00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:01.007
not as an alternative to lethal force,

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.307
but as a lethal force multiplier:

00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:05.915
that you use nonlethal weapons first,

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:08.915
so your lethal weapons
will actually be more effective.

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:12.773
The people you'll be shooting at
won't be able to get out of the way.

00:13:12.797 --> 00:13:16.190
They won't be aware of what's happening,
and you can kill them better.

00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:18.246
And that's exactly what happened here.

00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:22.007
The hostage takers who had
been rendered unconscious by the gas

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.449
were not taken into custody;

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:25.172
they were simply shot in the head.

00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:30.836
So this nonlethal weapon
was being used in this case

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.836
as a lethal force multiplier,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.309
to make killing more effective
in this particular situation.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.081
Another problem I want to quickly mention

00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:43.335
is that there's a whole heap of problems

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:46.836
with the way people are actually
taught to use nonlethal weapons,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.393
and get trained about them
and then tested and so on.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:52.292
Because they're tested
in nice, safe environments,

00:13:52.316 --> 00:13:54.953
and are taught to use them
in nice, safe environments --

00:13:54.977 --> 00:13:58.262
like this, where you can see
exactly what's going on.

00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:01.061
The person spraying the OC spray
is wearing a rubber glove

00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:03.527
to make sure they don't get
contaminated, and so on.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.162
But they're never used like that.

00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:07.354
They're used out in the real world,

00:14:07.378 --> 00:14:09.712
like in Texas, like this:

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:12.326
["Police Taser Great-Grandmother
During Traffic Stop"]

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.836
I confess, this particular case
was one that piqued my interest in this.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.308
It happened while I was working
as a research fellow

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:19.520
at the US Naval Academy.

00:14:19.544 --> 00:14:22.521
News reports started
coming up about this situation,

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:24.945
where this woman was arguing
with a police officer.

00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:26.352
She wasn't violent.

00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:29.289
In fact, he was probably
six inches taller than me,

00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:30.851
and she was about this tall.

00:14:31.632 --> 00:14:33.339
And eventually she said to him,

00:14:33.363 --> 00:14:35.464
"Well, I'm going to get back in my car."

00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:38.630
And he says, "If you get back
in your car, I'm going to tase you."

00:14:38.654 --> 00:14:41.774
And she says, "Oh, go ahead.
Tase me." And so he does.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.813
And it's all captured by the video camera

00:14:43.837 --> 00:14:46.494
running in the front of the police car.

00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:49.578
So, she's 72.

00:14:50.332 --> 00:14:53.786
And it's seen that this is the most
appropriate way of dealing with her.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.935
And there are other examples
of the same sorts of things,

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.125
where you think,

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:01.479
"Is this really an appropriate way
to use nonlethal weapons?"

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:04.135
"Police Chief Fires Taser
into 14 year old Girl's Head."

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:06.723
"She was running away.
What else was I suppose to do?"

00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:08.969
(Laughter)

00:15:08.993 --> 00:15:10.261
Or Florida:

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:13.763
"Police Taser 6-year-old
Boy at Elementary School."

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:17.524
And they clearly learned a lot from it,
because in the same district:

00:15:17.548 --> 00:15:20.189
"Police Review Policy
After Children Shocked:

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:22.920
2nd Child Shocked by Taser
Stun Gun Within Weeks."

00:15:22.944 --> 00:15:24.904
Same police district.

00:15:24.928 --> 00:15:28.113
Another child within weeks
of Tasering the six-year-old boy.

00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:31.622
Just in case you think it's only going
to happen in the United States,

00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:33.464
it happened in Canada as well:

00:15:33.488 --> 00:15:35.034
["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"]

00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:37.168
And a colleague sent me
this one from London:

00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:39.062
["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"]

00:15:39.086 --> 00:15:43.497
But my personal favorite,
I have to confess, does come from the US:

00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.813
"Officers Taser 86-year-old
Disabled Woman in her Bed."

00:15:46.837 --> 00:15:49.043
(Laughter)

00:15:49.067 --> 00:15:51.171
I checked the reports on this one.

00:15:51.195 --> 00:15:53.269
I looked at it. I was really surprised.

00:15:53.293 --> 00:15:57.461
Apparently, she took up a more
threatening position in her bed.

00:15:57.485 --> 00:15:59.175
(Laughter)

00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:01.248
I kid you not,
that's exactly what it said:

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:04.259
"She took up a more threatening
position in her bed."

00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:05.942
OK.

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.411
But I'd remind you --

00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:09.951
I'm talking about military
uses of nonlethal weapons,

00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:11.133
so why is this relevant?

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:14.379
Because police are actually
more restrained in the use of force

00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:15.870
than the military are.

00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:18.580
They're trained to be more
restrained in the use of force

00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:19.774
than the military are.

00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:22.340
They're trained to think more,
to try and De-escalate.

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:24.711
So if you have these problems
with police officers

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:25.901
with nonlethal weapons,

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:27.568
what on earth would make you think

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:30.107
it's going to be better
with military personnel?

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:33.167
The last thing that I would like to say:

00:16:34.032 --> 00:16:35.469
When I'm talking to the police

00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:38.033
about what a perfect nonlethal
weapon would look like,

00:16:38.057 --> 00:16:40.071
they almost inevitably say the same thing.

00:16:40.095 --> 00:16:42.777
They say, "It's got to be something
that's nasty enough

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.241
that people don't want
to be hit with this weapon.

00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:46.668
So if you threaten to use it,

00:16:46.692 --> 00:16:48.453
people are going to comply with it.

00:16:49.756 --> 00:16:51.664
But it's also going to be something

00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:53.767
that doesn't leave any lasting effects."

00:16:56.294 --> 00:16:57.451
In other words,

00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:01.077
your perfect nonlethal weapon
is something that's perfect for abuse.

00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:04.650
What would these guys have done
if they'd had access to Tasers,

00:17:04.674 --> 00:17:08.165
or to a manned, portable version
of the Active Denial System --

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.423
a small heat ray that you
can use on people

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:12.898
and not worry about.

00:17:13.803 --> 00:17:15.460
So I think yes,

00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:19.034
there may be ways that nonlethal weapons
will be great in these situations,

00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:21.017
but there's also a whole heap of problems

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.939
that need to be considered as well.

00:17:22.963 --> 00:17:24.123
Thanks very much.

00:17:24.147 --> 00:17:26.871
(Applause)
