00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.176
A hundred years ago this month,
a 36-year-old Albert Einstein

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.456
stood up in front of the Prussian
Academy of Sciences in Berlin

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.936
to present a radical new theory
of space, time and gravity:

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.976
the general theory of relativity.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.056
General relativity is unquestionably
Einstein's masterpiece,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.056
a theory which reveals the workings
of the universe at the grandest scales,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.456
capturing in one beautiful line of algebra

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.000
everything from why apples fall from trees
to the beginning of time and space.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.816
1915 must have been an exciting year
to be a physicist.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.336
Two new ideas were turning
the subject on its head.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.696
One was Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.896
the other was arguably
even more revolutionary:

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.376
quantum mechanics,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.936
a mind-meltingly strange
yet stunningly successful new way

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.240
of understanding the microworld,
the world of atoms and particles.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.576
Over the last century,
these two ideas have utterly transformed

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.336
our understanding of the universe.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.696
It's thanks to relativity
and quantum mechanics

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.056
that we've learned
what the universe is made from,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.599
how it began
and how it continues to evolve.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.656
A hundred years on, we now find ourselves
at another turning point in physics,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.160
but what's at stake now
is rather different.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.296
The next few years may tell us
whether we'll be able

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.176
to continue to increase
our understanding of nature,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.616
or whether maybe for the first time
in the history of science,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.576
we could be facing questions
that we cannot answer,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.176
not because we don't have
the brains or technology,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.440
but because the laws of physics
themselves forbid it.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.136
This is the essential problem:
the universe is far, far too interesting.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.816
Relativity and quantum mechanics
appear to suggest

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.136
that the universe
should be a boring place.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.056
It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.016
But when we look around us, we see we live
in a universe full of interesting stuff,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.096
full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.616
The question is, ultimately,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.936
why does all this interesting stuff exist?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.040
Why is there something
rather than nothing?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.576
This contradiction is the most pressing
problem in fundamental physics,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.320
and in the next few years, we may find out
whether we'll ever be able to solve it.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.176
At the heart of this problem
are two numbers,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.696
two extremely dangerous numbers.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.416
These are properties of the universe
that we can measure,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.976
and they're extremely dangerous

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.416
because if they were different,
even by a tiny bit,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.160
then the universe as we know it
would not exist.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.176
The first of these numbers is associated
with the discovery that was made

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.176
a few kilometers from this hall,
at CERN, home of this machine,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.256
the largest scientific device
ever built by the human race,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.136
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.136
The LHC whizzes subatomic particles
around a 27-kilometer ring,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.616
getting them closer and closer
to the speed of light

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.296
before smashing them into each other
inside gigantic particle detectors.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.816
On July 4, 2012, physicists
at CERN announced to the world

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.376
that they'd spotted
a new fundamental particle

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.760
being created at the violent collisions
at the LHC: the Higgs boson.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.496
Now, if you followed the news at the time,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.576
you'll have seen a lot of physicists
getting very excited indeed,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.256
and you'd be forgiven for thinking

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.816
we get that way every time
we discover a new particle.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.176
Well, that is kind of true,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.896
but the Higgs boson
is particularly special.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.376
We all got so excited
because finding the Higgs

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.736
proves the existence
of a cosmic energy field.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.376
Now, you may have trouble
imagining an energy field,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.829
but we've all experienced one.

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:39.389
If you've ever held a magnet
close to a piece of metal

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:41.536
and felt a force pulling across that gap,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.418
then you've felt the effect of a field.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:46.816
And the Higgs field
is a little bit like a magnetic field,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.656
except it has a constant value everywhere.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.136
It's all around us right now.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.896
We can't see it or touch it,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.136
but if it wasn't there,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.600
we would not exist.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.976
The Higgs field gives mass

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.376
to the fundamental particles
that we're made from.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.016
If it wasn't there, those particles
would have no mass,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.720
and no atoms could form
and there would be no us.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.336
But there is something deeply mysterious
about the Higgs field.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.056
Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us
that it has two natural settings,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.736
a bit like a light switch.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.136
It should either be off,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.816
so that it has a zero value
everywhere in space,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.200
or it should be on so it has
an absolutely enormous value.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.576
In both of these scenarios,
atoms could not exist,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.736
and therefore all the other
interesting stuff

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.399
that we see around us
in the universe would not exist.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.616
In reality, the Higgs field
is just slightly on,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.696
not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker
than its fully on value,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.840
a bit like a light switch that's got stuck
just before the off position.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.096
And this value is crucial.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.976
If it were a tiny bit different,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.656
then there would be
no physical structure in the universe.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.856
So this is the first
of our dangerous numbers,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.936
the strength of the Higgs field.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.696
Theorists have spent decades
trying to understand

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.376
why it has this very peculiarly
fine-tuned number,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.216
and they've come up
with a number of possible explanations.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.176
They have sexy-sounding names
like "supersymmetry"

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.136
or "large extra dimensions."

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.936
I'm not going to go
into the details of these ideas now,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.336
but the key point is this:

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.216
if any of them explained this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.976
then we should see new particles
being created at the LHC

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.976
along with the Higgs boson.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.960
So far, though, we've not seen
any sign of them.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.016
But there's actually an even worse example

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.416
of this kind of fine-tuning
of a dangerous number,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.056
and this time it comes
from the other end of the scale,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.936
from studying the universe
at vast distances.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.296
One of the most important consequences
of Einstein's general theory of relativity

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.736
was the discovery that the universe began
as a rapid expansion of space and time

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.536
13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.216
Now, according to early versions
of the Big Bang theory,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.416
the universe has been expanding ever since

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.496
with gravity gradually putting
the brakes on that expansion.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.856
But in 1998, astronomers made
the stunning discovery

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.696
that the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.856
The universe is getting
bigger and bigger faster and faster

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.720
driven by a mysterious repulsive force
called dark energy.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.696
Now, whenever you hear
the word "dark" in physics,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.216
you should get very suspicious

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.296
because it probably means
we don't know what we're talking about.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.336
(Laughter)

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.376
We don't know what dark energy is,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.136
but the best idea is that it's the energy
of empty space itself,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.376
the energy of the vacuum.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.936
Now, if you use good old
quantum mechanics to work out

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.576
how strong dark energy should be,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.816
you get an absolutely astonishing result.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.696
You find that dark energy

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.696
should be 10 to the power
of 120 times stronger

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.536
than the value we observe from astronomy.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.376
That's one with 120 zeroes after it.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.976
This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.216
that it's impossible
to get your head around.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.736
We often use the word "astronomical"
when we're talking about big numbers.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.416
Well, even that one won't do here.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.856
This number is bigger
than any number in astronomy.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.976
It's a thousand trillion
trillion trillion times bigger

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.640
than the number of atoms
in the entire universe.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.256
So that's a pretty bad prediction.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.995
In fact, it's been called
the worst prediction in physics,

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.296
and this is more than just
a theoretical curiosity.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.056
If dark energy were
anywhere near this strong,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.216
then the universe
would have been torn apart,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.560
stars and galaxies could not form,
and we would not be here.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.576
So this is the second
of those dangerous numbers,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.976
the strength of dark energy,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.936
and explaining it requires an even more
fantastic level of fine-tuning

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.484
than we saw for the Higgs field.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.440
But unlike the Higgs field,
this number has no known explanation.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.456
The hope was that a complete combination

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.696
of Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.296
which is the theory
of the universe at grand scales,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.776
with quantum mechanics, the theory
of the universe at small scales,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.656
might provide a solution.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.136
Einstein himself
spent most of his later years

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.336
on a futile search
for a unified theory of physics,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.736
and physicists have kept at it ever since.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.896
One of the most promising candidates
for a unified theory is string theory,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.216
and the essential idea is,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.736
if you could zoom in on the fundamental
particles that make up our world,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.416
you'd see actually
that they're not particles at all,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.056
but tiny vibrating strings of energy,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.416
with each frequency of vibration
corresponding to a different particle,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.000
a bit like musical notes
on a guitar string.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.056
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic
way of looking at the world,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.536
but it has one catastrophic problem.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.456
It turns out that string theory
isn't one theory at all,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.776
but a whole collection of theories.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.216
It's been estimated, in fact,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.176
that there are 10 to the 500
different versions of string theory.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.576
Each one would describe
a different universe

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.736
with different laws of physics.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.376
Now, critics say this makes
string theory unscientific.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.336
You can't disprove the theory.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.360
But others actually
turned this on its head

00:08:57.384 --> 00:08:59.656
and said, well,
maybe this apparent failure

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.016
is string theory's greatest triumph.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.416
What if all of these 10 to the 500
different possible universes

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.656
actually exist out there somewhere

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.800
in some grand multiverse?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.136
Suddenly we can understand

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.736
the weirdly fine-tuned values
of these two dangerous numbers.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.056
In most of the multiverse,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.056
dark energy is so strong
that the universe gets torn apart,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.416
or the Higgs field is so weak
that no atoms can form.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.616
We live in one of the places
in the multiverse

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.016
where the two numbers are just right.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.400
We live in a Goldilocks universe.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.496
Now, this idea is extremely controversial,
and it's easy to see why.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.416
If we follow this line of thinking,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.816
then we will never be able
to answer the question,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.296
"Why is there something
rather than nothing?"

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.496
In most of the multiverse,
there is nothing,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.336
and we live in one of the few places

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.360
where the laws of physics
allow there to be something.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.496
Even worse, we can't test
the idea of the multiverse.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.656
We can't access these other universes,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.920
so there's no way of knowing
whether they're there or not.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.976
So we're in an extremely
frustrating position.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.696
That doesn't mean
the multiverse doesn't exist.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.296
There are other planets,
other stars, other galaxies,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.496
so why not other universes?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.880
The problem is, it's unlikely
we'll ever know for sure.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.056
Now, the idea of the multiverse
has been around for a while,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.336
but in the last few years,
we've started to get the first solid hints

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.120
that this line of reasoning
may get born out.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.656
Despite high hopes
for the first run of the LHC,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.252
what we were looking for there --

00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:34.336
we were looking
for new theories of physics:

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.256
supersymmetry or large extra dimensions

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.496
that could explain this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.736
But despite high hopes, the LHC
revealed a barren subatomic wilderness

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.440
populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.016
My experiment published paper after paper

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.520
where we glumly had to conclude
that we saw no signs of new physics.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.056
The stakes now could not be higher.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.976
This summer, the LHC began
its second phase of operation

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.256
with an energy almost double
what we achieved in the first run.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.936
What particle physicists
are all desperately hoping for

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.736
are signs of new particles,
micro black holes,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.856
or maybe something totally unexpected

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.496
emerging from the violent collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.856
If so, then we can continue
this long journey

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.456
that began 100 years ago
with Albert Einstein

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.000
towards an ever deeper understanding
of the laws of nature.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.776
But if, in two or three years' time,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.136
when the LHC switches off again
for a second long shutdown,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.456
we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.296
then we may be entering
a new era in physics:

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.096
an era where there are weird features
of the universe that we cannot explain;

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.176
an era where we have hints
that we live in a multiverse

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.976
that lies frustratingly
forever beyond our reach;

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.256
an era where we will never be able
to answer the question,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.336
"Why is there something
rather than nothing?"

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.576
Thank you.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.016
(Applause)

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.096
Bruno Giussani: Harry,
even if you just said

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.976
the science may not have some answers,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.016
I would like to ask you a couple
of questions, and the first is:

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.056
building something like the LHC
is a generational project.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.376
I just mentioned, introducing you,
that we live in a short-term world.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.256
How do you think so long term,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.616
projecting yourself out a generation
when building something like this?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.056
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.896
that I joined the experiment
I work on at the LHC in 2008,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.301
just as we were switching on,

00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:33.576
and there are people in my research group
who have been working on it

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.216
for three decades,
their entire careers on one machine.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.416
So I think the first conversations
about the LHC were in 1976,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.136
and you start planning the machine
without the technology

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.576
that you know you're going to need
to be able to build it.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.136
So the computing power
did not exist in the early '90s

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.780
when design work began in earnest.

00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:51.020
One of the big detectors
which record these collisions,

00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:52.896
they didn't think there was technology

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.776
that could withstand the radiation
that would be created in the LHC,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.536
so there was basically a lump of lead
in the middle of this object

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.136
with some detectors around the outside,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.056
but subsequently
we have developed technology.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.416
So you have to rely on people's ingenuity,
that they will solve the problems,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.296
but it may be a decade
or more down the line.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.536
BG: China just announced
two or three weeks ago

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.016
that they intend to build

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.016
a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.656
I was wondering how you
and your colleagues welcome the news.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.416
HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.
BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.216
(Laughter)

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.336
It sounds funny for a particle
physicist to say that.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.696
But I mean, seriously, it's great news.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.216
So building a machine like the LHC

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.016
requires countries from all over the world
to pool their resources.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.376
No one nation can afford
to build a machine this large,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.616
apart from maybe China,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.856
because they can mobilize
huge amounts of resources,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.936
manpower and money
to build machines like this.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.216
So it's only a good thing.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.576
What they're really planning to do
is to build a machine

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.336
that will study the Higgs boson in detail
and could give us some clues

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.296
as to whether these new ideas,
like supersymmetry, are really out there,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.225
so it's great news for physics, I think.

00:13:51.249 --> 00:13:53.425
BG: Harry, thank you.
HC: Thank you very much.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:56.640
(Applause)
