00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.928
Will we do whatever it takes
to tackle climate change?

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:22.366
I come at this question
not as a green campaigner,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.985
in fact, I confess to be rather
hopeless at recycling.

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:30.669
I come at it as a professional observer
of financial policy making

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:35.450
and someone that wonders
how history will judge us.

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:37.609
One day,

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:41.498
this ring that belonged to my grandfather

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:43.529
will pass to my son, Charlie.

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.829
And I wonder what his generation

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:49.159
and perhaps the one that follows

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:54.021
will make of the two lives
this ring has worked.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:57.518
My grandfather was a coal miner.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.677
In his time,

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:05.585
burning fossil fuels for energy
and for allowing economies to develop

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:06.766
was accepted.

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:10.577
We know now that that is not the case

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.983
because of the greenhouse
gases that coal produces.

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:16.532
But today,

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:20.602
I fear it's the industry in which I work
that will be judged more harshly

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:22.662
because of its impact on the climate --

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:25.845
more harshly than
my grandfather's industry, even.

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:28.888
I work, of course,
in the banking industry,

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:32.704
which will be remembered
for its crisis in 2008 --

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:38.722
a crisis that diverted the attention
and finances of governments

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:44.127
away from some really, really
important promises,

00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:49.291
like promises made at the Copenhagen
Climate Summit in 2009

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.147
to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.685
to help developing countries
move away from burning fossil fuels

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.688
and transition to using cleaner energy.

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:03.391
That promise is already in jeopardy.

00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:05.769
And that's a real problem,

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:08.534
because that transition
to cleaner energy needs to happen

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:10.470
sooner rather than later.

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:12.340
Firstly,

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.342
because greenhouse gases, once released,

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.059
stay in the atmosphere for decades.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:18.271
And secondly,

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:24.122
if a developing economy builds
its power grid around fossil fuels today,

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:27.299
it's going to be way more costly
to change later on.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:30.462
So for the climate,

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.312
history may judge
that the banking crisis happened

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.315
at just the wrong time.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.608
The story need not be this gloomy, though.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.577
Three years ago,

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.497
I argued that governments
could use the tools

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.206
deployed to save the financial system

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.118
to meet other global challenges.

00:02:51.918 --> 00:02:57.041
And these arguments are getting
stronger, not weaker, with time.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:02.746
Let's take a brief reminder
of what those tools looked like.

00:03:03.578 --> 00:03:06.565
When the financial crisis hit in 2008,

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.166
the central banks of the US and UK

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.625
began buying bonds issued
by their own governments

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:14.948
in a policy known
as "quantitative easing."

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:19.095
Depending on what happens
to those bonds when they mature,

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.529
this is money printing by another name.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.254
And boy, did they print.

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:29.352
The US alone created four trillion
dollars' worth of its own currency.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.465
This was not done in isolation.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.163
In a remarkable act of cooperation,

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:38.760
the 188 countries that make up
the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:42.953
agreed to issue 250 billion
dollars' worth of their own currency --

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:45.049
the Special Drawing Right --

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:47.046
to boost reserves around the world.

00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.263
When the financial crisis moved to Europe,

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:55.067
the European Central Bank
President, Mario Draghi,

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:57.855
promised "to do whatever it takes."

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:00.768
And they did.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:06.050
The Bank of Japan repeated those words --
that exact same commitment --

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:10.185
to do "whatever it takes"
to reflate their economy.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.376
In both cases,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.639
"whatever it takes" meant
trillions of dollars more

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:20.891
in money-printing policies
that continue today.

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:23.122
What this shows

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:26.912
is that when faced
with some global challenges,

00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:32.707
policy makers are able to act
collectively, with urgency,

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:38.861
and run the risks of unconventional
policies like money printing.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.560
So, let's go back
to that original question:

00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.355
Can we print money for climate finance?

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.931
Three years ago,

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:54.690
the idea of using money in this way
was something of a taboo.

00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:57.890
Once you break down and dismantle the idea

00:04:57.914 --> 00:04:59.953
that money is a finite resource,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.063
governments can quickly get overwhelmed
by demands from their people

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:08.313
to print more and more
money for other causes:

00:05:08.337 --> 00:05:10.337
education, health care, welfare --

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.591
even defense.

00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:17.822
And there are some truly terrible
historical examples of money printing --

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:20.169
uncontrolled money printing --

00:05:20.193 --> 00:05:21.938
leading to hyperinflation.

00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:26.350
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:29.447
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,

00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.535
when the prices of basic goods
like bread are doubling every day.

00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:39.896
But all of this is moving
the public debate forward,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.248
so much so, that money printing
for the people is now discussed openly

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:49.486
in the financial media, and even
in some political manifestos.

00:05:50.203 --> 00:05:52.742
But it's important the debate
doesn't stop here,

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:54.949
with printing national currencies.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:06:01.851
Because climate change
is a shared global problem,

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.945
there are some really compelling reasons

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.398
why we should be printing
that international currency

00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:10.280
that's issued by the IMF,

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.535
to fund it.

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:15.149
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,

00:06:15.173 --> 00:06:18.529
is the IMF's electronic unit of account

00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:23.105
that governments use to transfer
funds amongst each other.

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.674
Think of it as a peer-to-peer
payment network,

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.474
like Bitcoin, but for governments.

00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:32.220
And it's truly global.

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:38.277
Each of the 188 members
of the IMF hold SDR quotas

00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.043
as part of their foreign
exchange reserves.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.223
These are national stores of wealth

00:06:44.247 --> 00:06:47.678
that countries keep to protect
themselves against currency crises.

00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:51.059
And that global nature is why,

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:54.011
at the height of the financial
crisis in 2009,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.128
the IMF issued those extra
250 billion dollars --

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:02.723
because it served
as a collective global action

00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:07.554
that safeguarded countries
large and small in one fell swoop.

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:10.339
But here --

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.029
here's the intriguing part.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:18.285
More than half of those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009 --

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:20.295
150 billion dollars' worth --

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.634
went to developed market countries
who, for the most part,

00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:27.495
have a modest need
for these foreign exchange reserves,

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.950
because they have flexible exchange rates.

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:34.808
So those extra reserves
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:34.832 --> 00:07:38.303
in the end, for developed
market countries at least,

00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:39.953
weren't really needed.

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:42.781
And they remain unused today.

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:45.002
So here's an idea.

00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:46.398
As a first step,

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:50.112
why don't we start
spending those unused,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.603
those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:55.174
to combat climate change?

00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:57.461
They could, for example,

00:07:57.485 --> 00:08:02.185
be used to buy bonds issued
by the UN's Green Climate Fund.

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.797
This was a fund created in 2009,

00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:09.095
following that climate
agreement in Copenhagen.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:14.262
And it was designed to channel funds
towards developing countries

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.353
to meet their climate projects.

00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:19.236
It's been one of the most
successful funds of its type,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.564
raising almost 10 billion dollars.

00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:25.026
But if we use those extra
SDRs that were issued,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.362
it helps governments get back on track,

00:08:28.386 --> 00:08:31.209
to meet that promise
of 100 billion dollars a year

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:33.823
that was derailed by the financial crisis.

00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.674
It could also --

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:40.344
it could also serve as a test case.

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:47.455
If the inflationary consequences
of using SDRs in this way are benign,

00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:50.429
it could be used to justify

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:55.187
the additional, extra issuance
of SDRs, say, every five years,

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:57.606
again, with the commitment

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.060
that developed-market countries
would direct their share

00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:03.545
of the new reserves

00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:05.362
to the Green Climate Fund.

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:10.800
Printing international money
in this way has several advantages

00:09:10.824 --> 00:09:12.885
over printing national currencies.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.315
The first is it's really easy to argue

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.756
that spending money to mitigate
climate change benefits everyone.

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:25.225
No one section of society benefits
from the printing press over another.

00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:29.033
That problem of competing
claims is mitigated.

00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:30.803
It's also fair to say

00:09:30.827 --> 00:09:35.954
that because it takes so many countries
to agree to issue these extra SDRs,

00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:40.181
it's highly unlikely that money printing
would get out of control.

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:46.025
What you end up with
is a collective, global action

00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:50.212
aimed -- and it's controlled
global action --

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:52.825
aimed at a global good.

00:09:53.637 --> 00:09:54.845
And,

00:09:54.869 --> 00:09:57.436
as we've learned
with the money-printing schemes,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.292
whatever concerns we have
can be allayed by rules.

00:10:00.757 --> 00:10:02.639
So, for example,

00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:07.636
the issuance of these extra SDRs
every five years could be capped,

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.255
such that this international currency
is never more than five percent

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.241
of global foreign exchange reserves.

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.806
That's important because it would allay

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.726
well, let's say, the ridiculous
concerns that the US might have

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.272
that the SDR could ever challenge
the dollar's dominant role

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:27.892
in international finance.

00:10:28.214 --> 00:10:29.997
And in fact,

00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.415
I think the only thing that the SDR
would likely steal from the dollar

00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:34.908
under this scheme

00:10:34.932 --> 00:10:38.403
is its nickname, the "greenback."

00:10:38.427 --> 00:10:42.343
Because even with that cap in place,

00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:45.831
the IMF could have
followed up its issuance --

00:10:45.855 --> 00:10:48.903
its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --

00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:53.919
with a further 200 billion
dollars of SDRs in 2014.

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.050
So hypothetically,

00:10:58.052 --> 00:11:01.170
that would mean that developed countries
could have contributed

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:05.715
up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:07.389
to the Green Climate Fund.

00:11:08.186 --> 00:11:11.646
That's 30 times what it has today.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.826
And you know,

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.691
as spectacular as that sounds,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.770
it's only just beginning to look
like "whatever it takes."

00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:24.447
And just to think what amazing things
could be done with that money,

00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:25.682
consider this:

00:11:26.618 --> 00:11:28.246
in 2009,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.008
Norway promised one billion dollars
of its reserves to Brazil

00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:37.695
if they followed through
on their goals on deforestation.

00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:44.892
That program has since delivered
a 70 percent reduction in deforestation

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.327
in the past decade.

00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:51.264
That's saving 3.2 billion tons
of carbon dioxide emissions,

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:55.819
which is the equivalent of taking
all American cars off the roads

00:11:55.843 --> 00:11:58.129
for three whole years.

00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:01.006
So what could we do

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.074
with 300 other pay-for-performance
climate projects like that,

00:12:06.098 --> 00:12:08.977
organized on a global scale?

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:12.804
We could take cars off the roads
for a generation.

00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:14.534
So,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.283
let's not quibble about whether we can
afford to fund climate change.

00:12:20.877 --> 00:12:23.125
The real question is:

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.546
Do we care enough about future generations

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.611
to take the very same policy risks
we took to save the financial system?

00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:33.421
After all,

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:35.468
we could do it,

00:12:36.284 --> 00:12:37.435
we did do it

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:39.190
and we are doing it today.

00:12:39.808 --> 00:12:44.126
We must, must, must do
"whatever it takes."

00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:46.577
Thank you.

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:50.967
(Applause)
