00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:14.740
Cancer.

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.186
Many of us have lost family,
friends or loved ones

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.890
to this horrible disease.

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.010
I know there are some of you
in the audience

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:23.275
who are cancer survivors,

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:25.454
or who are fighting cancer at this moment.

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:27.469
My heart goes out to you.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:32.767
While this word often conjures up
emotions of sadness and anger and fear,

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.305
I bring you good news
from the front lines of cancer research.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.189
The fact is, we are starting to win
the war on cancer.

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:42.841
In fact, we lie at the intersection

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:47.054
of the three of the most exciting
developments within cancer research.

00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:49.363
The first is cancer genomics.

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:51.412
The genome is a composition

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:54.372
of all the genetic information
encoded by DNA

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:55.763
in an organism.

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:58.628
In cancers, changes
in the DNA called mutations

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:01.454
are what drive these cancers
to go out of control.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.182
Around 10 years ago,
I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins

00:01:05.206 --> 00:01:07.804
that first mapped
the mutations of cancers.

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.014
We did this first for colorectal,

00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:12.564
breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.

00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:16.496
And since then, there have been
over 90 projects in 70 countries

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.110
all over the world,

00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:21.509
working to understand
the genetic basis of these diseases.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.587
Today, tens of thousands
of cancers are understood

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.906
down to exquisite molecular detail.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.322
The second revolution
is precision medicine,

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:32.750
also known as "personalized medicine."

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:36.351
Instead of one-size-fits-all methods
to be able to treat cancers,

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:40.030
there is a whole new class of drugs
that are able to target cancers

00:01:40.054 --> 00:01:42.261
based on their unique genetic profile.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:45.667
Today, there are a host
of these tailor-made drugs,

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:47.021
called targeted therapies,

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.228
available to physicians even today

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:52.515
to be able to personalize
their therapy for their patients,

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.465
and many others are in development.

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:58.414
The third exciting revolution
is immunotherapy,

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.214
and this is really exciting.

00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:03.575
Scientists have been able
to leverage the immune system

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.094
in the fight against cancer.

00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:09.848
For example, there have been ways
where we find the off switches of cancer,

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:13.316
and new drugs have been able
to turn the immune system back on,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.928
to be able to fight cancer.

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:19.043
In addition, there are ways
where you can take away immune cells

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:20.227
from the body,

00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:23.338
train them, engineer them
and put them back into the body

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:24.739
to fight cancer.

00:02:24.763 --> 00:02:27.441
Almost sounds like
science fiction, doesn't it?

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.926
While I was a researcher
at the National Cancer Institute,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.405
I had the privilege of working
with some of the pioneers of this field

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:36.675
and watched the development firsthand.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.142
It's been pretty amazing.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:41.171
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:45.380
actively recruiting patients
to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.

00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:49.545
While these three exciting
revolutions are ongoing,

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.593
unfortunately, this is only the beginning,

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:54.828
and there are still many, many challenges.

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:56.601
Let me illustrate with a patient.

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.932
Here is a patient
with a skin cancer called melanoma.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:04.003
It's horrible; the cancer
has gone everywhere.

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:08.746
However, scientists were able
to map the mutations of this cancer

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.826
and give a specific treatment
that targets one of the mutations.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.223
And the result is almost miraculous.

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.693
Tumors almost seem to melt away.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.242
Unfortunately, this is not
the end of the story.

00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:25.376
A few months later, this picture is taken.

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.464
The tumor has come back.

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.027
The question is: Why?

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:33.144
The answer is tumor heterogeneity.

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.176
Let me explain.

00:03:36.944 --> 00:03:40.432
Even a cancer as small
as one centimeter in diameter

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:43.149
harbors over a hundred million
different cells.

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:45.549
While genetically similar,

00:03:45.573 --> 00:03:48.282
there are small differences
in these different cancers

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:51.163
that make them differently prone
to different drugs.

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:53.615
So even if you have a drug
that's highly effective,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.374
that kills almost all the cells,

00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.588
there is a chance
that there's a small population

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:00.386
that's resistant to the drug.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.432
This ultimately is the population

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:03.620
that comes back,

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:04.962
and takes over the patient.

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.566
So then the question is:
What do we do with this information?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.852
Well, the key, then,

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:14.746
is to apply all these exciting
advancements in cancer therapy earlier,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.992
as soon as we can,

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:18.355
before these resistance clones emerge.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.409
The key to cancer and curing cancer
is early detection.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.928
And we intuitively know this.

00:04:25.952 --> 00:04:29.038
Finding cancer early
results in better outcomes,

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:31.108
and the numbers show this as well.

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:35.375
For example, in ovarian cancer,
if you detect cancer in stage four,

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:38.528
only 17 percent of the women
survive at five years.

00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:43.516
However, if you are able to detect
this cancer as early as stage one,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.232
over 92 percent of women will survive.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:51.548
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent
of women are detected at stage one,

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:57.144
whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,
are detected in stages three and four.

00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:01.349
We desperately need
better detection mechanisms for cancers.

00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:06.151
The current best ways to screen cancer
fall into one of three categories.

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:08.350
First is medical procedures,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.282
which is like colonoscopy
for colon cancer.

00:05:11.306 --> 00:05:15.922
Second is protein biomarkers,
like PSA for prostate cancer.

00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:18.858
Or third, imaging techniques,

00:05:18.882 --> 00:05:21.245
such as mammography for breast cancer.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.665
Medical procedures are the gold standard;

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.785
however, they are highly invasive

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.614
and require a large
infrastructure to implement.

00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:33.706
Protein markers, while effective
in some populations,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.219
are not very specific
in some circumstances,

00:05:36.243 --> 00:05:38.826
resulting in high numbers
of false positives,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.055
which then results in unnecessary work-ups
and unnecessary procedures.

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:48.106
Imaging methods,
while useful in some populations,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.678
expose patients to harmful radiation.

00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:54.316
In addition, it is not applicable
to all patients.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.383
For example, mammography has problems
in women with dense breasts.

00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:02.250
So what we need is a method
that is noninvasive,

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:04.041
that is light in infrastructure,

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:05.328
that is highly specific,

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:09.189
that also does not have false positives,

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:11.179
does not use any radiation

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:14.134
and is applicable to large populations.

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:15.332
Even more importantly,

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:17.552
we need a method
to be able to detect cancers

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:20.268
before they're 100 million cells in size.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.445
Does such a technology exist?

00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:25.749
Well, I wouldn't be up here
giving a talk if it didn't.

00:06:26.722 --> 00:06:30.193
I'm excited to tell you about
this latest technology we've developed.

00:06:31.035 --> 00:06:33.737
Central to our technology
is a simple blood test.

00:06:34.202 --> 00:06:37.932
The blood circulatory system,
while seemingly mundane,

00:06:37.956 --> 00:06:40.286
is essential for you to survive,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.815
providing oxygen
and nutrients to your cells,

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.444
and removing waste and carbon dioxide.

00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:47.321
Here's a key biological insight:

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.323
Cancer cells grow and die
faster than normal cells,

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:52.543
and when they die,

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:55.288
DNA is shed into the blood system.

00:06:55.312 --> 00:06:58.082
Since we know the signatures
of these cancer cells

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:00.810
from all the different cancer
genome sequencing projects,

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:02.875
we can look for those signals in the blood

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.071
to be able to detect these cancers early.

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.028
So instead of waiting for cancers
to be large enough to cause symptoms,

00:07:10.052 --> 00:07:12.951
or for them to be dense enough
to show up on imaging,

00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:15.417
or for them to be prominent enough

00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.681
for you to be able to visualize
on medical procedures,

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:22.697
we can start looking for cancers
while they are relatively pretty small,

00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:26.325
by looking for these small amounts
of DNA in the blood.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:29.310
So let me tell you how we do this.

00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:32.198
First, like I said, we start off
with a simple blood test --

00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:34.797
no radiation, no complicated equipment --

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.287
a simple blood test.

00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:37.847
Then the blood is shipped to us,

00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:40.260
and what we do
is extract the DNA out of it.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.326
While your body is mostly healthy cells,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.996
most of the DNA that's detected
will be from healthy cells.

00:07:47.654 --> 00:07:50.721
However, there will be a small amount,
less than one percent,

00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:52.477
that comes from the cancer cells.

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:57.571
Then we use molecular biology methods
to be able to enrich this DNA

00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:02.007
for areas of the genome which are known
to be associated with cancer,

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.984
based on the information
from the cancer genomics projects.

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:09.361
We're able to then put this DNA
into DNA-sequencing machines

00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:14.075
and are able to digitize the DNA
into A's, C's, T's and G's

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:15.697
and have this final readout.

00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:22.261
Ultimately, we have information
of billions of letters

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:25.295
that output from this run.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.675
We then apply statistical
and computational methods

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.371
to be able to find
the small signal that's present,

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:36.051
indicative of the small amount
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:39.523
So does this actually work in patients?

00:08:39.547 --> 00:08:43.037
Well, because there's no way
of really predicting right now

00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:44.569
which patients will get cancer,

00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:46.650
we use the next best population:

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.696
cancers in remission;

00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:51.794
specifically, lung cancer.

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.534
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs
that we have today,

00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:57.770
most lung cancers come back.

00:08:57.794 --> 00:08:59.094
The key, then, is to see

00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:02.769
whether we're able to detect
these recurrences of cancers

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:04.660
earlier than with standard methods.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:07.536
We just finished a major trial

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.307
with Professor Charles Swanton
at University College London,

00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:12.497
examining this.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:15.039
Let me walk you through
an example of one patient.

00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:19.413
Here's an example of one patient
who undergoes surgery

00:09:19.437 --> 00:09:20.605
at time point zero,

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:23.111
and then undergoes chemotherapy.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:26.014
Then the patient is under remission.

00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:30.647
He is monitored using clinical exams
and imaging methods.

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:35.872
Around day 450, unfortunately,
the cancer comes back.

00:09:37.086 --> 00:09:39.571
The question is:
Are we able to catch this earlier?

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:43.340
During this whole time,
we've been collecting blood serially

00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:46.642
to be able to measure
the amount of ctDNA in the blood.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.677
So at the initial time point, as expected,

00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.399
there's a high level
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:09:54.423 --> 00:09:58.090
However, this goes away to zero
in subsequent time points

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:01.571
and remains negligible
after subsequent points.

00:10:02.813 --> 00:10:08.086
However, around day 340, we see the rise
of cancer DNA in the blood,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.675
and eventually, it goes up higher
for days 400 and 450.

00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:15.667
Here's the key, if you've missed it:

00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:20.672
At day 340, we see the rise
in the cancer DNA in the blood.

00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:24.912
That means we are catching this cancer
over a hundred days earlier

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:26.413
than traditional methods.

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.734
This is a hundred days earlier
where we can give therapies,

00:10:29.758 --> 00:10:33.077
a hundred days earlier
where we can do surgical interventions,

00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:36.134
or even a hundred days less
for the cancer to grow

00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:39.280
or a hundred days less
for resistance to occur.

00:10:40.502 --> 00:10:44.677
For some patients, this hundred days
means the matter of life and death.

00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:47.560
We're really excited
about this information.

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:51.456
Because of this assignment,
we've done additional studies now

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.742
in other cancers,

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:56.101
including breast cancer, lung cancer

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.346
and ovarian cancer,

00:10:57.888 --> 00:11:02.238
and I can't wait to see how much earlier
we can find these cancers.

00:11:04.174 --> 00:11:05.642
Ultimately, I have a dream,

00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:08.480
a dream of two vials of blood,

00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:13.221
and that, in the future, as part of all
of our standard physical exams,

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:15.173
we'll have two vials of blood drawn.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:18.983
And from these two vials of blood
we will be able to compare

00:11:19.007 --> 00:11:22.518
the DNA from all known
signatures of cancer,

00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:26.489
and hopefully then detect cancers
months to even years earlier.

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:29.350
Even with the therapies we have currently,

00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:31.975
this could mean that millions
of lives could be saved.

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:36.170
And if you add on to that
recent advancements in immunotherapy

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:37.486
and targeted therapies,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.682
the end of cancer is in sight.

00:11:40.754 --> 00:11:42.911
The next time you hear the word "cancer,"

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.361
I want you to add to the emotions: hope.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:47.281
Hold on.

00:11:48.162 --> 00:11:51.735
Cancer researchers all around the world
are working feverishly

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:52.915
to beat this disease,

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:54.969
and tremendous progress is being made.

00:11:55.776 --> 00:11:57.744
This is the beginning of the end.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.329
We will win the war on cancer.

00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:02.545
And to me, this is amazing news.

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.180
Thank you.

00:12:04.204 --> 00:12:08.725
(Applause)
