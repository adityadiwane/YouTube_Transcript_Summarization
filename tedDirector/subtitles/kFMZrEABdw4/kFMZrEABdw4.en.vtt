00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:18.418
I was here four years ago,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.236
and I remember, at the time,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.779
that the talks weren't put online.

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.236
I think they were given
to TEDsters in a box,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.111
a box set of DVDs,

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.627
which they put on their shelves,
where they are now.

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.627
(Laughter)

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.237
And actually, Chris called me
a week after I'd given my talk, and said,

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.465
"We're going to start putting them online.
Can we put yours online?"

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369
And I said, "Sure."

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:45.972
And four years later,

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:50.236
it's been downloaded four million times.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.972
So I suppose you could multiply that
by 20 or something

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:56.044
to get the number
of people who've seen it.

00:00:56.068 --> 00:01:00.172
And, as Chris says, there is
a hunger for videos of me.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.269
(Laughter)

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:06.293
(Applause)

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.338
Don't you feel?

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.280
(Laughter)

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.861
So, this whole event
has been an elaborate build-up

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.524
to me doing another one
for you, so here it is.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.035
(Laughter)

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:30.236
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference
I spoke at four years ago

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.962
and talked about the climate crisis.

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:36.057
And I referenced that
at the end of my last talk.

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:38.236
So I want to pick up from there

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.310
because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.366
(Laughter)

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.236
So, as I was saying --

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
(Laughter)

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.582
You see, he's right.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:56.236
I mean, there is a major
climate crisis, obviously,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.356
and I think if people don't believe it,
they should get out more.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.556
(Laughter)

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:06.603
But I believe there is
a second climate crisis,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.802
which is as severe,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:11.236
which has the same origins,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.682
and that we have to deal with
with the same urgency.

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:17.462
And you may say, by the way,

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:19.170
"Look, I'm good.

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:22.376
I have one climate crisis,
I don't really need the second one."

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:23.701
(Laughter)

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:26.098
But this is a crisis of,
not natural resources --

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:28.044
though I believe that's true --

00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:30.268
but a crisis of human resources.

00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:32.236
I believe fundamentally,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.030
as many speakers have said
during the past few days,

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:39.500
that we make very poor use of our talents.

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:42.260
Very many people go
through their whole lives

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:45.236
having no real sense
of what their talents may be,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.236
or if they have any to speak of.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.370
I meet all kinds of people

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.958
who don't think
they're really good at anything.

00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:56.385
Actually, I kind of divide the world
into two groups now.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.813
Jeremy Bentham, the great
utilitarian philosopher,

00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:01.236
once spiked this argument.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.924
He said, "There are two types
of people in this world:

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:05.908
those who divide the world into two types

00:03:05.932 --> 00:03:07.108
and those who do not."

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:10.132
(Laughter)

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.989
Well, I do.

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:16.013
(Laughter)

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:24.702
I meet all kinds of people
who don't enjoy what they do.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.519
They simply go through their lives
getting on with it.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.402
They get no great pleasure
from what they do.

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:33.899
They endure it rather than enjoy it,

00:03:33.923 --> 00:03:35.366
and wait for the weekend.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.155
But I also meet people

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.236
who love what they do
and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.067
If you said, "Don't do this anymore,"

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.088
they'd wonder what you're talking about.

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:48.188
It isn't what they do, it's who they are.

00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:50.153
They say, "But this is me, you know.

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:52.082
It would be foolish to abandon this,

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.208
because it speaks
to my most authentic self."

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:57.363
And it's not true of enough people.

00:03:57.847 --> 00:04:01.331
In fact, on the contrary, I think
it's still true of a minority of people.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.236
And I think there are many
possible explanations for it.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.647
And high among them is education,

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.045
because education, in a way,

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.592
dislocates very many people
from their natural talents.

00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:19.005
And human resources
are like natural resources;

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.371
they're often buried deep.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.531
You have to go looking for them,

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:24.722
they're not just lying around
on the surface.

00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:27.950
You have to create the circumstances
where they show themselves.

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:31.474
And you might imagine
education would be the way that happens,

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:32.998
but too often, it's not.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.573
Every education system in the world
is being reformed at the moment

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:38.870
and it's not enough.

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:42.004
Reform is no use anymore,

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:44.655
because that's simply improving
a broken model.

00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:46.440
What we need --

00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:49.233
and the word's been used
many times in the past few days --

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:51.011
is not evolution,

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.638
but a revolution in education.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:57.236
This has to be transformed
into something else.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.282
(Applause)

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.565
One of the real challenges
is to innovate fundamentally in education.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:11.477
Innovation is hard,

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.697
because it means doing something
that people don't find very easy,

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:16.083
for the most part.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.515
It means challenging
what we take for granted,

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.531
things that we think are obvious.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:25.236
The great problem for reform
or transformation

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.275
is the tyranny of common sense.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.454
Things that people think,

00:05:29.478 --> 00:05:32.007
"It can't be done differently,
that's how it's done."

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:34.848
I came across a great quote recently
from Abraham Lincoln,

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:37.713
who I thought you'd be pleased
to have quoted at this point.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.482
(Laughter)

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:45.767
He said this in December 1862
to the second annual meeting of Congress.

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:49.767
I ought to explain that I have no idea
what was happening at the time.

00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:53.965
We don't teach
American history in Britain.

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:55.902
(Laughter)

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:58.236
We suppress it.
You know, this is our policy.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.564
(Laughter)

00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:03.968
No doubt, something fascinating
was happening then,

00:06:03.992 --> 00:06:06.702
which the Americans among us
will be aware of.

00:06:08.607 --> 00:06:09.614
But he said this:

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:17.061
"The dogmas of the quiet past
are inadequate to the stormy present.

00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.839
The occasion
is piled high with difficulty,

00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:25.241
and we must rise with the occasion."

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:26.843
I love that.

00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:28.883
Not rise to it, rise with it.

00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:32.452
"As our case is new,

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:37.556
so we must think anew and act anew.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.236
We must disenthrall ourselves,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.225
and then we shall save our country."

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.575
I love that word, "disenthrall."

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:48.076
You know what it means?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.236
That there are ideas
that all of us are enthralled to,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.293
which we simply take for granted
as the natural order of things,

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:55.689
the way things are.

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:58.363
And many of our ideas have been formed,

00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:00.625
not to meet the circumstances
of this century,

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:03.316
but to cope with the circumstances
of previous centuries.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.513
But our minds
are still hypnotized by them,

00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:08.236
and we have to disenthrall ourselves
of some of them.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:11.188
Now, doing this is easier said than done.

00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:14.425
It's very hard to know, by the way,
what it is you take for granted.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.244
And the reason
is that you take it for granted.

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:18.270
(Laughter)

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:20.628
Let me ask you something
you may take for granted.

00:07:20.652 --> 00:07:22.821
How many of you here
are over the age of 25?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.382
That's not what you take for granted,
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.236
Are there any people here
under the age of 25?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.236
Great. Now, those over 25,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.236
could you put your hands up
if you're wearing your wristwatch?

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:39.236
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.253
Ask a room full of teenagers
the same thing.

00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:44.895
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.833
I don't mean they can't,

00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.308
they just often choose not to.

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:52.301
And the reason is we were brought up
in a pre-digital culture,

00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:53.536
those of us over 25.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.709
And so for us,
if you want to know the time,

00:07:55.733 --> 00:07:57.679
you have to wear something to tell it.

00:07:57.703 --> 00:08:00.402
Kids now live in a world
which is digitized,

00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:02.236
and the time, for them, is everywhere.

00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:03.978
They see no reason to do this.

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:06.251
And by the way, you don't need either;

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:09.244
it's just that you've always done it
and you carry on doing it.

00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:12.513
My daughter never wears a watch,
my daughter Kate, who's 20.

00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:13.930
She doesn't see the point.

00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:15.741
As she says,

00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:17.636
"It's a single-function device."

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.788
(Laughter)

00:08:22.812 --> 00:08:24.479
"Like, how lame is that?"

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:27.396
And I say, "No, no,
it tells the date as well."

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.420
(Laughter)

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.863
"It has multiple functions."

00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:35.236
(Laughter)

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.712
But, you see, there are things
we're enthralled to in education.

00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:40.648
A couple of examples.

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:43.395
One of them is the idea of linearity:

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.055
that it starts here
and you go through a track

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:47.602
and if you do everything right,

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:50.253
you will end up set
for the rest of your life.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.784
Everybody who's spoken at TED
has told us implicitly,

00:08:54.808 --> 00:08:57.484
or sometimes explicitly,
a different story:

00:08:57.508 --> 00:09:00.236
that life is not linear; it's organic.

00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:02.730
We create our lives symbiotically

00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:04.603
as we explore our talents

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.467
in relation to the circumstances
they help to create for us.

00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:11.236
But, you know, we have become obsessed
with this linear narrative.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.960
And probably the pinnacle for education
is getting you to college.

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:18.236
I think we are obsessed
with getting people to college.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:19.961
Certain sorts of college.

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:22.889
I don't mean you shouldn't go,
but not everybody needs to go,

00:09:22.913 --> 00:09:24.106
or go now.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.762
Maybe they go later, not right away.

00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:29.914
And I was up in San Francisco
a while ago doing a book signing.

00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:32.737
There was this guy buying a book,
he was in his 30s.

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.031
I said, "What do you do?"

00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:36.039
And he said, "I'm a fireman."

00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:39.236
I asked, "How long
have you been a fireman?"

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.577
"Always. I've always been a fireman."

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.567
"Well, when did you decide?"
He said, "As a kid.

00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:46.687
Actually, it was
a problem for me at school,

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.237
because at school,
everybody wanted to be a fireman."

00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.275
(Laughter)

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:52.236
He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."

00:09:53.012 --> 00:09:55.801
And he said, "When I got
to the senior year of school,

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:58.236
my teachers didn't take it seriously.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.512
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.

00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:02.583
He said I was throwing my life away

00:10:02.607 --> 00:10:04.623
if that's all I chose to do with it;

00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:07.953
that I should go to college, I should
become a professional person,

00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:09.236
that I had great potential

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.390
and I was wasting my talent to do that."

00:10:11.414 --> 00:10:12.828
He said, "It was humiliating.

00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:15.438
It was in front of the whole class
and I felt dreadful.

00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:17.969
But it's what I wanted,
and as soon as I left school,

00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:20.291
I applied to the fire service
and I was accepted.

00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:22.601
You know, I was thinking
about that guy recently,

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.816
just a few minutes ago when you
were speaking, about this teacher,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.674
because six months ago, I saved his life."

00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:32.305
(Laughter)

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:36.688
He said, "He was in a car wreck,
and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:38.561
and I saved his wife's life as well."

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.451
He said, "I think he thinks
better of me now."

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:43.236
(Laughter)

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.070
(Applause)

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:50.991
You know, to me,

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:55.236
human communities depend
upon a diversity of talent,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.716
not a singular conception of ability.

00:10:58.188 --> 00:11:00.165
And at the heart of our challenges --

00:11:00.189 --> 00:11:02.830
(Applause)

00:11:02.854 --> 00:11:04.236
At the heart of the challenge

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.231
is to reconstitute our sense of ability
and of intelligence.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.963
This linearity thing is a problem.

00:11:11.414 --> 00:11:14.236
When I arrived in L.A.
about nine years ago,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.389
I came across a policy statement --

00:11:18.413 --> 00:11:19.676
very well-intentioned --

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.158
which said, "College
begins in kindergarten."

00:11:24.124 --> 00:11:25.314
No, it doesn't.

00:11:25.338 --> 00:11:29.069
(Laughter)

00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:30.891
It doesn't.

00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:34.086
If we had time,
I could go into this, but we don't.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.324
(Laughter)

00:11:36.348 --> 00:11:38.824
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.

00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:41.158
(Laughter)

00:11:41.182 --> 00:11:42.935
A friend of mine once said,

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:45.396
"A three year-old
is not half a six year-old."

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.236
(Laughter)

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.789
(Applause)

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:53.925
They're three.

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:55.949
But as we just heard in this last session,

00:11:55.973 --> 00:11:59.236
there's such competition now
to get into kindergarten --

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.119
to get to the right kindergarten --

00:12:01.143 --> 00:12:04.975
that people are being interviewed
for it at three.

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:09.173
Kids sitting in front
of unimpressed panels,

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:10.674
you know, with their resumes --

00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:13.289
(Laughter)

00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:15.587
Flicking through and saying,
"What, this is it?"

00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:17.236
(Laughter)

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.579
(Applause)

00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:23.559
"You've been around
for 36 months, and this is it?"

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:30.636
(Laughter)

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.414
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:33.824
(Laughter)

00:12:33.848 --> 00:12:36.649
Spent the first six months
breastfeeding, I can see."

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.332
(Laughter)

00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:44.379
See, it's outrageous as a conception.

00:12:44.403 --> 00:12:46.593
The other big issue is conformity.

00:12:46.617 --> 00:12:50.236
We have built our education systems
on the model of fast food.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:53.748
This is something Jamie Oliver
talked about the other day.

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:56.319
There are two models
of quality assurance in catering.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:58.983
One is fast food,
where everything is standardized.

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:01.322
The other is like Zagat
and Michelin restaurants,

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:03.109
where everything is not standardized,

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:05.158
they're customized to local circumstances.

00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:08.559
And we have sold ourselves
into a fast-food model of education,

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.658
and it's impoverishing
our spirit and our energies

00:13:11.682 --> 00:13:14.503
as much as fast food is depleting
our physical bodies.

00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:20.380
(Applause)

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:23.264
We have to recognize
a couple of things here.

00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:25.636
One is that human talent
is tremendously diverse.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.463
People have very different aptitudes.

00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:31.236
I worked out recently
that I was given a guitar as a kid

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.236
at about the same time
that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.864
(Laughter)

00:13:35.888 --> 00:13:38.120
It worked out for Eric,
that's all I'm saying.

00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:39.166
(Laughter)

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.277
In a way --

00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:42.672
it did not for me.

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:45.237
I could not get this thing to work

00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:47.793
no matter how often
or how hard I blew into it.

00:13:47.817 --> 00:13:49.524
It just wouldn't work.

00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:50.872
(Laughter)

00:13:53.158 --> 00:13:54.539
But it's not only about that.

00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:55.721
It's about passion.

00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:59.318
Often, people are good at things
they don't really care for.

00:13:59.342 --> 00:14:00.536
It's about passion,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.236
and what excites
our spirit and our energy.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.641
And if you're doing the thing
that you love to do, that you're good at,

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:08.935
time takes a different course entirely.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.557
My wife's just finished writing a novel,

00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:14.612
and I think it's a great book,

00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:17.236
but she disappears for hours on end.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.641
You know this, if you're doing
something you love,

00:14:19.665 --> 00:14:21.550
an hour feels like five minutes.

00:14:22.203 --> 00:14:25.251
If you're doing something
that doesn't resonate with your spirit,

00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:26.866
five minutes feels like an hour.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.574
And the reason so many people
are opting out of education

00:14:29.598 --> 00:14:31.915
is because it doesn't feed their spirit,

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:34.717
it doesn't feed their energy
or their passion.

00:14:35.034 --> 00:14:37.024
So I think we have to change metaphors.

00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:41.094
We have to go from what is essentially
an industrial model of education,

00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:42.919
a manufacturing model,

00:14:42.943 --> 00:14:47.306
which is based on linearity
and conformity and batching people.

00:14:47.728 --> 00:14:49.633
We have to move to a model

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:52.236
that is based more
on principles of agriculture.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.523
We have to recognize

00:14:53.547 --> 00:14:57.474
that human flourishing
is not a mechanical process;

00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.427
it's an organic process.

00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:03.037
And you cannot predict
the outcome of human development.

00:15:03.061 --> 00:15:05.754
All you can do, like a farmer,
is create the conditions

00:15:05.778 --> 00:15:07.951
under which they will begin to flourish.

00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:11.800
So when we look at reforming
education and transforming it,

00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:14.082
it isn't like cloning a system.

00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:16.678
There are great ones,
like KIPP's; it's a great system.

00:15:16.702 --> 00:15:18.541
There are many great models.

00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:21.787
It's about customizing
to your circumstances

00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:25.236
and personalizing education
to the people you're actually teaching.

00:15:25.888 --> 00:15:28.961
And doing that, I think,
is the answer to the future

00:15:28.985 --> 00:15:32.400
because it's not
about scaling a new solution;

00:15:32.424 --> 00:15:34.741
it's about creating
a movement in education

00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:37.236
in which people develop
their own solutions,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.545
but with external support
based on a personalized curriculum.

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:42.236
Now in this room,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.236
there are people who represent
extraordinary resources in business,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.552
in multimedia, in the Internet.

00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:50.236
These technologies,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.026
combined with the extraordinary
talents of teachers,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.903
provide an opportunity
to revolutionize education.

00:15:56.927 --> 00:15:59.022
And I urge you to get involved in it

00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:02.666
because it's vital, not just to ourselves,
but to the future of our children.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.093
But we have to change
from the industrial model

00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:06.768
to an agricultural model,

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:09.816
where each school can be
flourishing tomorrow.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.688
That's where children experience life.

00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:13.578
Or at home, if that's what they choose,

00:16:13.602 --> 00:16:15.815
to be educated
with their families or friends.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:19.990
There's been a lot of talk about dreams
over the course of these few days.

00:16:20.474 --> 00:16:22.500
And I wanted to just very quickly --

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:25.429
I was very struck
by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,

00:16:25.453 --> 00:16:26.738
recovering old poems.

00:16:27.468 --> 00:16:29.604
I wanted to read you
a quick, very short poem

00:16:29.628 --> 00:16:31.718
from W. B. Yeats,
who some of you may know.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.129
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,

00:16:36.153 --> 00:16:39.034
and he was bewailing the fact

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:42.308
that he couldn't really give her
what he thought she wanted from him.

00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:45.728
And he says, "I've got something else,
but it may not be for you."

00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:46.894
He says this:

00:16:47.768 --> 00:16:50.640
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,

00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:53.537
Enwrought with gold and silver light,

00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:58.069
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

00:16:58.093 --> 00:17:01.020
Of night and light and the half-light,

00:17:02.162 --> 00:17:04.307
I would spread the cloths under your feet:

00:17:05.314 --> 00:17:09.288
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

00:17:10.156 --> 00:17:12.740
I have spread my dreams under your feet;

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:15.017
Tread softly

00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:17.421
because you tread on my dreams."

00:17:18.117 --> 00:17:20.901
And every day, everywhere,

00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:24.114
our children spread
their dreams beneath our feet.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.284
And we should tread softly.

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:28.522
Thank you.

00:17:28.546 --> 00:17:32.180
(Applause)

00:17:32.204 --> 00:17:33.583
Thank you very much.

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:37.625
(Applause)

00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:38.664
Thank you.

00:17:38.688 --> 00:17:41.688
(Applause)
