00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the canary in the mine wasn't singing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so the question that we might not have birds

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And the question was, were the birds singing?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What is a bird?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It comes in California with a warning --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a bird.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then label it and sell it to children?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I think we have a design problem.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
"We realize that design is a signal of intention,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but it also has to occur within a world,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and we have to understand that world in order to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
imbue our designs with inherent intelligence,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because the news is the news of abundance,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and not the news of limits,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and I think as our culture tortures itself now

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
driven by the sun, and start to imagine

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
what that would be like to share."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That was a nice thing to get.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That was one sentence.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Henry James would be proud.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is -- I put it down at the bottom,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but that was extemporaneous, obviously.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The fundamental issue is that, for me,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
design is the first signal of human intentions.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
well, what would our intention be as a species

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
now that we're the dominant species?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because how could you dominate something you had killed?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And stewardship's implicit in dominion,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So the question is, what is the first question for designers?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the question we're asking the guardian at this point is

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
are we meant, how are we meant,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to secure local societies, create world peace

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and save the environment?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But I don't know that that's the common debate.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
essentially creative, highly effective and efficient,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
value for very long if we don't trust each other.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but the question we bring to it is,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
how do we love all the children of all species for all time?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And so we start our designs with that question.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Because what we realize today is that modern culture

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to cause global warming on the way here,"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and we say, "That's not part of my plan,"

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
then we realize it's part of our de facto plan.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And I was at the White House for President Bush,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
meeting with every federal department and agency,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
"Brain death for all children. No child left behind."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Applause)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So, the question is, how many federal officials

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
then you're just moving chess pieces around,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
if you don't know you're taking the king.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
which requires humility. And in my business as an architect,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to put wheels on our luggage.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so we call it "cradle to cradle,"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and our goal is very simple.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This is what I presented to the White House.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
with clean air, clean water, soil and power --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Applause)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
What don't you like about this?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Which part of this don't you like?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So we realized we want full diversity,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
when asked what it was like to be President of France.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So we've designed products

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
instead of Alzheimer's later in life.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We can ask ourselves, what is justice,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and is justice blind, or is justice blindness?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A fundamental issue that's not being addressed.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We've seen the first form of solar energy

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We see that companies acting ethically in this world

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
are outperforming those that don't.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
which is from copper.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
On the other hand, we see great signs of hope.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
how to do mass-produced health.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
He has given eyesight to two million people for free.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
because of the contaminants of the coatings --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
They become building steel.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the largest carpet company in the world.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
down to the parts per million.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
with six million people in 40 square miles.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
without understanding nutrient flow.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
among the first growth and big growth.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I went to Yale for graduate school,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
affectionately known in our business as Brutalism.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
If we look at the world of architecture,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and the windows are all closed. And with most products

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
appearing not to have been designed for indoor use,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
this is actually a vertical gas chamber.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
as a student, which I then built --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
which would give you a sense of my ambition.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000
solar energy has nothing to do with architecture."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for Environmental Defense.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and it was to prove there was no danger

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
from secondhand smoke in the workplace.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you see that little blue thing above Hawaii?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
That's the Pacific Gyre.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Perhaps that's away.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So we're looking for the design rules of this --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
259 species of tree, and we described this

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in the book, "Cradle to Cradle."

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
"we write our history on the skin of fish

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
with the blood of bears."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And with so much polymer, what we really need

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
is technical nutrition, and to use something

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Laughter)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So, we're looking at the same criteria

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
as most people -- you know, can I afford it?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Does it work? Do I like it?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Now if we look at the word "competition,"

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I'm sure most of you've used it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You know, most people don't realize it comes from

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the Latin competere, which means strive together.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
They get fit together, and then they compete.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So we've been looking at the idea of competition

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And the Chinese government has now --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I work with the Chinese government now --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
has taken this up.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We're also looking at survival of the fittest,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
not in just competition terms in our modern context

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
of destroy the other or beat them to the ground,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
but really to fit together and build niches

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and have growth that is good.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But if we look at asphalt as our growth,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
then we realize that all we're doing is destroying

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and all of a sudden, you get this biology.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
all these toxic materials that we disgorge,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
we will never be able to recover that.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
it has to have free energy, sunlight

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and we want an open metabolism for chemicals.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but what do you want to grow?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So instead of just growing destruction,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So therefore, we have these two metabolisms,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The biological one I'm sure you understand,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
but also the technical one, where we take materials

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and put them into closed cycles.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the world would run out of cork and dry up.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So we need materials in closed cycles,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and their production and so on.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
in the textile industry.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We were left with 38 chemicals.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So designers all over the world can analyze their products

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
down to the parts per million for human and ecological health.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
(Applause)

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We've developed a protocol so that companies can send

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
these same messages all the way through their supply chains,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
-- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers."

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
"And where does it go?"

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
"Customers."

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So we need some help there.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the water coming out was clean enough to drink.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
a cradle to cradle car -- concept car.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
the bottoms are biodegradable soles.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
There is no finish line.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it's all solar-powered.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
of San Bruno, California, are on the roof.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
This is obviously a color photograph.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
This is the roof, saving money,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
They showed up in five days.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And we now have 350-pound auto workers

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
learning bird songs on the Internet.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We're developing now protocols for cities --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
that's the home of technical nutrients.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And so I will finish by showing you a new city

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
we're designing for the Chinese government.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
We're doing 12 cities for China right now,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
based on cradle to cradle as templates.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
for 400 million people in 12 years.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
They'll have cities with no energy and no food.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding --

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
for China to adopt cradle to cradle.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
we have what, effectively, when I was a student,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
was called mutually assured destruction.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
This is the site.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
so they brought us in to intercede.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
This is their plan.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and here's our proposal.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
(Applause)

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So the way we approached this

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
is we studied the hydrology very carefully.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
We studied the biota, the ancient biota,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
the current farming and the protocols.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
in every single apartment at some point during the day.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We lay out the building areas.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
so the people all have centers and places to be.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
The transportation is all very simple,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
The waste systems all connect.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
which are sold as assets, not liabilities.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And then the compost is all taken back

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
because what we've done is lifted up the city,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000
the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
on the roofs of the buildings.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
The solar power of all the factory centers

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And this is the concept for the top of the city.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:07.000
(Applause)
