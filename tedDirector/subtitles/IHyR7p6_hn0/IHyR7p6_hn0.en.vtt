00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:19.433
There have been many revolutions
over the last century,

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:23.677
but perhaps none as significant
as the longevity revolution.

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:28.852
We are living on average
today 34 years longer

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:31.354
than our great-grandparents did --
think about that.

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:34.632
That's an entire second adult lifetime

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:36.430
that's been added to our lifespan.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:38.341
And yet, for the most part,

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.736
our culture has not come to terms
with what this means.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.525
We're still living with the old paradigm

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.526
of age as an arch.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.466
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.600
You're born, you peak at midlife

00:00:50.624 --> 00:00:52.736
and decline into decrepitude.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.433
(Laughter)

00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:56.575
Age as pathology.

00:00:57.464 --> 00:01:01.736
But many people today -- philosophers,
artists, doctors, scientists --

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.084
are taking a new look
at what I call "the third act" --

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:07.130
the last three decades of life.

00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:12.736
They realize that this is actually
a developmental stage of life

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.150
with its own significance,

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:20.223
as different from midlife
as adolescence is from childhood.

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:23.931
And they are asking --
we should all be asking:

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.424
How do we use this time?

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:28.872
How do we live it successfully?

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:32.429
What is the appropriate
new metaphor for aging?

00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:36.465
I've spent the last year researching
and writing about this subject.

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:41.736
And I have come to find
that a more appropriate metaphor for aging

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.300
is a staircase --

00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.418
the upward ascension of the human spirit,

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:51.736
bringing us into wisdom,
wholeness, and authenticity.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.069
Age not at all as pathology.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:55.736
Age as potential.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.179
And guess what?

00:01:57.203 --> 00:01:59.843
This potential is not for the lucky few.

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:02.943
It turns out, most people over 50

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.247
feel better, are less stressed,
less hostile, less anxious.

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.737
We tend to see commonalities
more than differences.

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:14.571
Some of the studies even say
we're happier.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:15.625
(Laughter)

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.369
This is not what I expected, trust me.

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:20.530
I come from a long line of depressives.

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:23.508
As I was approaching my late 40s,

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:25.325
when I would wake up in the morning,

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.780
my first six thoughts
would all be negative.

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:28.966
And I got scared.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.273
I thought, "Oh my gosh.
I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.301
But now that I am actually smack-dab
in the middle of my own third act,

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.736
I realize I've never been happier.

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:43.738
I have such a powerful
feeling of well-being.

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:46.032
And I've discovered

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.613
that when you're inside oldness,

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.990
as opposed to looking
at it from the outside,

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:52.284
fear subsides.

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:54.640
You realize you're still yourself --

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:56.020
maybe even more so.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.750
Picasso once said, "It takes
a long time to become young."

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:02.942
(Laughter)

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.816
I don't want to romanticize aging.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.515
Obviously, there's no guarantee

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.974
that it can be a time
of fruition and growth.

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.341
Some of it is a matter of luck.

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.905
Some of it, obviously, is genetic.

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.053
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.

00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:18.340
And there isn't much we can do about that.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:23.710
But that means that two-thirds
of how well we do in the third act,

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:25.560
we can do something about.

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.507
We're going to discuss what we can do

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:31.507
to make these added years
really successful,

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.327
and use them to make a difference.

00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:37.300
Now, let me say something
about the staircase,

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:41.341
which may seem like an odd
metaphor for seniors,

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:44.328
given the fact that many seniors
are challenged by stairs.

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:45.666
(Laughter)

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.660
Myself included.

00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:54.379
As you may know, the entire world
operates on a universal law:

00:03:54.403 --> 00:03:57.544
entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.

00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:00.823
Entropy means that everything
in the world -- everything --

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:03.009
is in a state of decline and decay --

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:04.206
the arch.

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.725
There's only one exception
to this universal law,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.068
and that is the human spirit,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.712
which can continue to evolve
upwards, the staircase,

00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:19.311
bringing us into wholeness,
authenticity, and wisdom.

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:22.155
And here's an example of what I mean.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.236
This upward ascension

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.795
can happen even in the face
of extreme physical challenges.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.007
About three years ago,
I read an article in the New York Times.

00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:34.172
It was about a man named Neil Selinger --

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:36.874
57 years old, a retired lawyer,

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.973
who had joined the writers'
group at Sarah Lawrence,

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:42.252
where he found his writer's voice.

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:44.053
Two years later,

00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:48.403
he was diagnosed with ALS,
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:50.790
It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.302
It wastes the body,
but the mind remains intact.

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:57.863
In this article,
Mr. Selinger wrote the following

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.719
to describe what was happening to him.

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.771
And I quote:

00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:05.608
"As my muscles weakened,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.235
my writing became stronger.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.533
As I slowly lost my speech,

00:05:11.972 --> 00:05:13.590
I gained my voice.

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.628
As I diminished, I grew.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.977
As I lost so much,

00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:21.779
I finally started to find myself."

00:05:23.692 --> 00:05:24.944
Neil Selinger, to me,

00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:28.349
is the embodiment
of mounting the staircase

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:29.881
in his third act.

00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:33.640
Now we're all born with spirit, all of us,

00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:37.808
but sometimes it gets tamped down
beneath the challenges of life,

00:05:37.832 --> 00:05:39.689
violence, abuse, neglect.

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:43.347
Perhaps our parents
suffered from depression.

00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:48.277
Perhaps they weren't able to love us
beyond how we performed in the world.

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:53.236
Perhaps we still suffer
from a psychic pain, a wound.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.825
Perhaps we feel
that many of our relationships

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.236
have not had closure.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.768
And so we can feel unfinished.

00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:04.279
Perhaps the task of the third act

00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:07.559
is to finish up the task
of finishing ourselves.

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:14.214
For me, it began as I was approaching
my third act, my 60th birthday.

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:16.414
How was I supposed to live it?

00:06:16.823 --> 00:06:19.735
What was I supposed to accomplish
in this final act?

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.362
And I realized that,
in order to know where I was going,

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.494
I had to know where I'd been.

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:30.236
And so I went back
and I studied my first two acts,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.883
trying to see who I was then,

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:38.350
who I really was, not who my parents
or other people told me I was,

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:40.000
or treated me like I was.

00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:41.192
But who was I?

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:44.005
Who were my parents --
not as parents, but as people?

00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:46.718
Who were my grandparents?

00:06:46.742 --> 00:06:48.508
How did they treat my parents?

00:06:48.532 --> 00:06:49.855
These kinds of things.

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:55.175
I discovered, a couple of years later,

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.176
that this process that I had gone through

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.940
is called by psychologists
"doing a life review."

00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:05.830
And they say it can give new significance
and clarity and meaning

00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:07.296
to a person's life.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.622
You may discover, as I did,

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:13.622
that a lot of things
that you used to think were your fault,

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:17.371
a lot of things you used
to think about yourself,

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.483
really had nothing to do with you.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.236
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.661
And you're able to go back
and forgive them.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.612
And forgive yourself.

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.898
You're able to free yourself

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:33.616
from your past.

00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:37.640
You can work to change
your relationship to your past.

00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:40.297
Now while I was writing about this,

00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:43.533
I came upon a book called
"Man's Search for Meaning"

00:07:43.557 --> 00:07:45.058
by Viktor Frankl.

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:47.657
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:50.442
who'd spent five years
in a Nazi concentration camp.

00:07:50.982 --> 00:07:53.223
And he wrote that,
while he was in the camp,

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:57.387
he could tell, should
they ever be released,

00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:01.733
which of the people would be OK,
and which would not.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.631
And he wrote this:

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:10.024
"Everything you have in life
can be taken from you

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:11.401
except one thing:

00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:17.115
your freedom to choose
how you will respond to the situation.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.910
This is what determines
the quality of the life we've lived --

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.990
not whether we've been rich or poor,

00:08:24.014 --> 00:08:25.746
famous or unknown,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.199
healthy or suffering.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:33.623
What determines our quality of life
is how we relate to these realities,

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:35.799
what kind of meaning we assign them,

00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:38.990
what kind of attitude
we cling to about them,

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:41.814
what state of mind
we allow them to trigger."

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:45.689
Perhaps the central purpose
of the third act

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:49.690
is to go back and to try, if appropriate,

00:08:49.714 --> 00:08:53.324
to change our relationship to the past.

00:08:53.974 --> 00:08:57.156
It turns out that cognitive research shows

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.960
when we are able to do this,

00:08:58.984 --> 00:09:01.563
it manifests neurologically --

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:04.680
neural pathways are created in the brain.

00:09:04.704 --> 00:09:06.681
You see, if you have, over time,

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:10.108
reacted negatively
to past events and people,

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.414
neural pathways are laid down

00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:15.875
by chemical and electrical signals
that are sent through the brain.

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.706
And over time, these neural pathways
become hardwired.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.556
They become the norm --
even if it's bad for us,

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.358
because it causes us stress and anxiety.

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:27.649
If, however,

00:09:27.673 --> 00:09:31.409
we can go back and alter our relationship,

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:35.729
re-vision our relationship
to past people and events,

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:37.702
neural pathways can change.

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:41.684
And if we can maintain
the more positive feelings

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:42.865
about the past,

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:44.691
that becomes the new norm.

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:47.294
It's like resetting a thermostat.

00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:51.196
It's not having experiences

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.652
that makes us wise.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.529
It's reflecting on the experiences
that we've had that makes us wise

00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:01.530
and that helps us become whole,

00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:03.767
brings wisdom and authenticity.

00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:06.532
It helps us become
what we might have been.

00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:09.902
Women start off whole, don't we?

00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:12.698
I mean, as girls, we're feisty --
"Yeah? Who says?"

00:10:12.722 --> 00:10:13.772
(Laughter)

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:14.961
We have agency.

00:10:14.985 --> 00:10:17.435
We are the subjects of our own lives.

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:18.843
But very often,

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:21.452
many, if not most of us,
when we hit puberty,

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:24.260
we start worrying
about fitting in and being popular.

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:28.815
And we become the subjects
and objects of other people's lives.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.280
But now, in our third acts,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.639
it may be possible for us
to circle back to where we started,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.837
and know it for the first time.

00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:41.642
And if we can do that,

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:44.232
it will not just be for ourselves.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:48.308
Older women are the largest
demographic in the world.

00:10:49.093 --> 00:10:52.423
If we can go back and redefine ourselves

00:10:52.447 --> 00:10:54.030
and become whole,

00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:57.939
this will create
a cultural shift in the world,

00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:02.029
and it will give an example
to younger generations

00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:04.918
so that they can reconceive
their own lifespan.

00:11:04.942 --> 00:11:06.212
Thank you very much.

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:13.125
