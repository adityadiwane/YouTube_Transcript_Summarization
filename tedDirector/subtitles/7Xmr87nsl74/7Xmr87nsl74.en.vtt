00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.975
Radical openness is still a distant future

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.271
in the field of school education.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.160
We have such a hard time figuring out

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.381
that learning is not a place but an activity.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.852
But I want to tell you the story of PISA,

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:33.230
OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.859
of 15-year-olds around the world,

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.381
and it's really a story of how international comparisons

00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.656
have globalized the field of education that we usually treat

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:45.591
as an affair of domestic policy.

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:48.015
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s,

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.846
in terms of the proportion of people

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:52.586
who had completed high school.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:56.406
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else,

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:59.119
and much of the economic success of the United States

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.863
draws on its long-standing advantage

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:04.735
as the first mover in education.

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:07.958
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.647
In the 1980s, the global expansion

00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:13.243
of the talent pool continued.

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:16.943
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.967
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.903
In the '90s, it was 13th,

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:24.304
and not because standards had fallen,

00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:28.059
but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:31.589
Korea shows you what's possible in education.

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:34.534
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.965
of Afghanistan today,

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:41.106
and was one of the lowest education performers.

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:46.658
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:49.634
So this tells us that, in a global economy,

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:54.215
it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:59.396
but the best performing education systems internationally.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.839
The trouble is that

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:03.709
measuring how much time people spend in school

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.733
or what degree they have got is not always

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:10.757
a good way of seeing what they can actually do.

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:14.430
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.624
while employers say they cannot find the people

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:20.423
with the skills they need.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.087
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:28.457
into better skills and better jobs and better lives.

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:31.066
So with PISA, we try to change this

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.937
by measuring the knowledge and skills

00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:36.373
of people directly.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:38.271
And we took a very special angle to this.

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.753
We were less interested in whether students can simply

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:43.854
reproduce what they have learned in school,

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:46.570
but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.483
from what they know

00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:52.362
and apply their knowledge in novel situations.

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:55.194
Now, some people have criticized us for this.

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:57.141
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.953
is terribly unfair to people, because we test students

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.926
with problems they haven't seen before.

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:04.967
But if you take that logic, you know,

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:07.895
you should consider life unfair, because

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:11.084
the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:12.204
what we learned in school,

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:15.525
but whether we are prepared for change,

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:17.946
whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:20.292
to use technologies that haven't been invented,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:25.209
to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.394
And once hotly contested,

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:30.831
our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:33.073
In our latest assessment in 2009,

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:36.485
we measured 74 school systems

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:40.072
that together cover 87 percent of the economy.

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:43.746
This chart shows you the performance of countries.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.633
In red, sort of below OECD average.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:50.009
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.363
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:56.053
Finland in Europe;

00:03:56.053 --> 00:04:00.419
Canada in North America doing really well.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.860
You can also see that there is a gap of almost

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.937
three and a half school years between

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:08.305
15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile,

00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:11.010
and the gap grows to seven school years

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.633
when you include the countries with really poor performance.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:17.104
There's a world of difference in the way in which

00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:22.306
young people are prepared for today's economy.

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:25.852
But I want to introduce a second important dimension

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:28.073
into this picture.

00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:32.448
Educators like to talk about equity.

00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:36.158
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:38.385
in terms of ensuring that people

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:41.825
from different social backgrounds have equal chances.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.560
And we see that in some countries, the impact

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.439
of social background on learning outcomes

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.577
is very, very strong.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.495
Opportunities are unequally distributed.

00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:53.110
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.178
We see in other countries that it matters much less

00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:59.671
into which social context you're born.

00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.066
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:06.562
where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.

00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:09.233
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there,

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:10.614
where performance is poor

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:13.959
and there are large social disparities.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.114
And then we can debate, you know, is it better

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:17.913
to be there, where performance is strong

00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:20.873
at the price of large disparities?

00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:26.492
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.474
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.217
you see there are a lot of countries that actually

00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:36.985
are combining excellence with equity.

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:39.593
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:42.699
is that you don't have to compromise equity

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.546
to achieve excellence.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:47.985
These countries have moved on from providing excellence

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.254
for just some to providing excellence for all,

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:53.226
a very important lesson.

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:58.202
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems

00:05:58.202 --> 00:06:02.505
that believe they are mainly there to sort people.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:05.017
And ever since those results came out, policymakers,

00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:06.994
educators, researchers from around the world

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:08.355
have tried to figure out

00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:11.785
what's behind the success of those systems.

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:13.609
But let's step back for a moment

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:16.623
and focus on the countries that actually started PISA,

00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:19.169
and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.661
And I'm making the size of the bubble

00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:24.203
proportional

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:27.998
to the amount of money that countries spent on students.

00:06:27.998 --> 00:06:29.550
If money would tell you everything

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.629
about the quality of learning outcomes,

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.960
you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.505
But that's not what you see.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:39.810
Spending per student only explains about,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.106
well, less than 20 percent

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:45.624
of the performance variation among countries,

00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:47.914
and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,

00:06:47.914 --> 00:06:50.378
doesn't do particularly well.

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:52.754
What you see is that two countries with similar spending

00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:54.674
achieve very different results.

00:06:54.674 --> 00:06:58.923
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings --

00:06:58.923 --> 00:07:02.512
that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:05.202
between rich and well-educated countries,

00:07:05.202 --> 00:07:07.522
and poor and badly-educated ones,

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:11.117
a very, very important lesson.

00:07:11.117 --> 00:07:13.699
Let's look at this in greater detail.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.505
The red dot shows you

00:07:15.505 --> 00:07:19.962
spending per student relative to a country's wealth.

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:22.769
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.274
and you can see Korea investing a lot

00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:28.298
in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.

00:07:28.298 --> 00:07:30.224
And Korea also invests into long school days,

00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:32.980
which drives up costs further.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.120
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.400
not only to teach but also to develop.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.735
They invest in professional development and collaboration

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:41.815
and many other things.

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:43.456
All that costs money.

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:46.126
How can Korea afford all of this?

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:49.866
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:54.334
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.

00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.229
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.332
and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:03.865
so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.

00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:06.759
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.206
in Luxembourg all like small classes.

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:11.974
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.878
So they have invested all their money into there,

00:08:13.878 --> 00:08:17.224
and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.

00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:21.385
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,

00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:23.590
and the price for this is that

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.694
teachers are not paid particularly well.

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:28.373
Students don't have long hours of learning.

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:31.615
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.

00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:35.296
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently,

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:37.616
and actually how they spent their money

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:43.619
matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:46.173
Let's go back to the year 2000.

00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:50.168
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:52.292
This is how the world looked then

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:56.553
in terms of PISA performance.

00:08:56.553 --> 00:08:59.368
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?

00:08:59.368 --> 00:09:00.999
We spent a lot less on education,

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.071
about 35 percent less on education.

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:06.816
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:10.169
has it become so much better?

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:13.168
And the bitter truth really is that, you know,

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:15.613
not in many countries.

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:17.696
But there are some countries which have seen

00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:20.644
impressive improvements.

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:24.440
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.328
featured in the lower quadrant,

00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:29.493
below average performance, large social disparities.

00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:31.496
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:35.224
that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:36.985
Very disappointing results.

00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:39.722
People were stunned by the results.

00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:43.513
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany

00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:47.219
was dominated for months by education,

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:49.953
not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education

00:09:49.953 --> 00:09:52.504
was the center of the public debate.

00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:55.723
And then policymakers began to respond to this.

00:09:55.723 --> 00:09:59.953
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:03.582
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:06.544
with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.

00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:11.052
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about

00:10:11.052 --> 00:10:14.811
optimizing existing policies,

00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:18.224
but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms

00:10:18.224 --> 00:10:20.011
underlying German education.

00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:23.897
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children

00:10:23.897 --> 00:10:26.515
was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases

00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:29.547
where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities

00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:32.635
when they sent their children to kindergarten.

00:10:32.635 --> 00:10:35.283
PISA has transformed that debate,

00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:38.056
and pushed early childhood education right at the center

00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:40.448
of public policy in Germany.

00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:44.149
Or traditionally, the German education divides children

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:46.897
at the age of 10, very young children,

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:51.086
between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers

00:10:51.086 --> 00:10:54.436
and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,

00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:56.912
and that mainly along socioeconomic lines,

00:10:56.912 --> 00:11:01.080
and that paradigm is being challenged now too.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.564
A lot of change.

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:06.518
And the good news is, nine years later,

00:11:06.518 --> 00:11:09.617
you can see improvements in quality and equity.

00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:11.893
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.021
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.

00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:16.566
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well,

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:19.891
but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share

00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:24.250
of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.064
They took up the challenge,

00:11:26.064 --> 00:11:29.598
and Korea was able to double the proportion of students

00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:34.000
achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.553
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students,

00:11:36.553 --> 00:11:38.472
you know what happens is disparities grow,

00:11:38.472 --> 00:11:42.272
and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,

00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:44.983
but still, an impressive improvement.

00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:47.569
A major overhaul of Poland's education

00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:51.202
helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:53.896
turn around many of the lowest-performing schools,

00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:58.730
and raise performance by over half a school year.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.521
And you can see other countries as well.

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:03.464
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,

00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:06.456
raise quality and improve equity,

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:08.332
and so did Hungary.

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:11.763
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:14.696
And even those people who complain and say that

00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:16.385
the relative standing of countries

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:19.807
on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,

00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:22.849
of economic factors, of social issues,

00:12:22.849 --> 00:12:25.911
of homogeneity of societies, and so on,

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:30.753
these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.

00:12:30.753 --> 00:12:33.793
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.

00:12:33.793 --> 00:12:36.297
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.389
the compositions of its population.

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:41.243
It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies

00:12:41.243 --> 00:12:43.883
and practice. Very impressive.

00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:46.848
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn

00:12:46.848 --> 00:12:48.952
from those countries in the green quadrant

00:12:48.952 --> 00:12:51.227
who have achieved high levels of equity,

00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:54.959
high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:58.873
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context

00:12:58.873 --> 00:13:01.589
provide a model elsewhere?

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:04.919
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:08.846
but these comparisons have identified a range of factors

00:13:08.846 --> 00:13:12.167
that high-performing systems share.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.727
Everybody agrees that education is important.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.714
Everybody says that.

00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:19.969
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority

00:13:19.969 --> 00:13:22.265
against other priorities?

00:13:22.265 --> 00:13:24.278
How do countries pay their teachers

00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.383
relative to other highly skilled workers?

00:13:27.383 --> 00:13:29.868
Would you want your child to become a teacher

00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:31.980
rather than a lawyer?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.982
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?

00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:36.487
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:40.581
from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:44.131
the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices

00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:46.509
that value education, their future,

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:49.181
more than consumption today.

00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:51.227
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:54.213
but there are countries in which the most attractive place

00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:57.133
to be is not the shopping center but the school.

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:59.400
Those things really exist.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.373
But placing a high value on education

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:04.224
is just part of the picture.

00:14:04.224 --> 00:14:07.253
The other part is the belief that all children

00:14:07.253 --> 00:14:10.688
are capable of success.

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:12.449
You have some countries where students

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:14.688
are segregated early in their ages.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.734
You know, students are divided up,

00:14:16.734 --> 00:14:19.069
reflecting the belief that only some children

00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:22.621
can achieve world-class standards.

00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:26.676
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:30.060
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.166
parents and teachers in those countries

00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:36.077
expect every student to succeed,

00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:39.569
and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.

00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:42.285
When we asked students what counts

00:14:42.285 --> 00:14:45.021
for success in mathematics,

00:14:45.021 --> 00:14:47.413
students in North America would typically tell us,

00:14:47.413 --> 00:14:48.959
you know, it's all about talent.

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:53.585
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.

00:14:53.585 --> 00:14:56.311
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say

00:14:56.311 --> 00:15:00.557
that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,

00:15:00.557 --> 00:15:05.292
and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.

00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:10.101
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.

00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:13.433
High performers on PISA embrace diversity

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:17.181
with differentiated pedagogical practices.

00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:19.157
They realize that

00:15:19.157 --> 00:15:22.301
ordinary students have extraordinary talents,

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:25.661
and they personalize learning opportunities.

00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:27.697
High-performing systems also share

00:15:27.697 --> 00:15:31.303
clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.

00:15:31.303 --> 00:15:33.505
Every student knows what matters.

00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:37.592
Every student knows what's required to be successful.

00:15:37.592 --> 00:15:40.457
And nowhere does the quality of an education system

00:15:40.457 --> 00:15:42.900
exceed the quality of its teachers.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.968
High-performing systems are very careful

00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:48.102
in how they recruit and select their teachers

00:15:48.102 --> 00:15:49.823
and how they train them.

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:52.653
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers

00:15:52.653 --> 00:15:54.973
in difficulties who are struggling,

00:15:54.973 --> 00:15:57.882
and how they structure teacher pay.

00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:01.578
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together

00:16:01.578 --> 00:16:05.135
to frame good practice.

00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:09.296
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow

00:16:09.296 --> 00:16:11.411
in their careers.

00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:13.035
In bureaucratic school systems,

00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:15.028
teachers are often left alone in classrooms

00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:18.195
with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.

00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:21.405
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.

00:16:21.405 --> 00:16:24.179
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:25.956
their teachers to figure out,

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:30.071
what do I need to teach to my students today?

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:34.617
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.

00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:39.859
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.

00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:43.499
High performers have moved on from professional

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:47.163
or from administrative forms of accountability and control --

00:16:47.163 --> 00:16:50.400
sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education --

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.066
to professional forms of work organization.

00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:57.938
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.

00:16:57.938 --> 00:17:00.428
They provide them with the kind of development they need

00:17:00.428 --> 00:17:04.490
to develop stronger pedagogical practices.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:10.148
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.

00:17:10.148 --> 00:17:12.882
High-performing systems have made teachers

00:17:12.882 --> 00:17:16.168
and school principals inventive.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.867
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,

00:17:18.867 --> 00:17:21.049
on provision.

00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:23.852
The high-performing systems have helped teachers

00:17:23.852 --> 00:17:26.293
and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,

00:17:26.293 --> 00:17:28.986
the next school around their lives.

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:31.152
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems

00:17:31.152 --> 00:17:34.299
is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:36.496
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,

00:17:36.496 --> 00:17:38.186
but what makes Finland so impressive

00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:42.163
is that only five percent of the performance variation

00:17:42.163 --> 00:17:44.619
amongst students lies between schools.

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:46.935
Every school succeeds.

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:49.666
This is where success is systemic.

00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:51.370
And how do they do that?

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.062
They invest resources where they can make the most difference.

00:17:54.062 --> 00:17:59.170
They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.378
and the most talented teachers

00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:03.321
into the most challenging classroom.

00:18:03.321 --> 00:18:06.450
Last but not least, those countries align policies

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.670
across all areas of public policy.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.803
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time,

00:18:11.803 --> 00:18:16.506
and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:18.810
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.601
doesn't yet tell us how to improve.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.059
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:27.534
of international comparisons of PISA are.

00:18:27.534 --> 00:18:30.237
That's where other forms of research need to kick in,

00:18:30.237 --> 00:18:32.695
and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.455
telling countries what they should be doing.

00:18:34.455 --> 00:18:36.278
But its strength lies in telling them

00:18:36.278 --> 00:18:39.033
what everybody else has been doing.

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:41.229
And the example of PISA shows that data

00:18:41.229 --> 00:18:44.547
can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy

00:18:44.547 --> 00:18:48.488
through which we usually run education systems.

00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.526
You know, some people argue that

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:53.714
changing educational administration

00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:56.155
is like moving graveyards.

00:18:56.155 --> 00:19:01.042
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)

00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:05.909
But PISA has shown what's possible in education.

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:09.714
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.

00:19:09.714 --> 00:19:13.922
It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.

00:19:13.922 --> 00:19:17.355
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:20.453
in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:25.003
If we can help every child, every teacher, every school,

00:19:25.003 --> 00:19:28.658
every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,

00:19:28.658 --> 00:19:31.394
that only the sky is the limit to education improvement,

00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:33.290
we have laid the foundations

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.473
for better policies and better lives.

00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:38.006
Thank you.

00:19:38.006 --> 00:19:42.006
(Applause)
