00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:15.097
Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:16.741
living two lives.

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.057
In one, I used NASA supercomputers

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:21.785
to design next-generation spacecraft,

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:24.364
and in the other I was a data scientist

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:26.783
looking for potential smugglers

00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:30.022
of sensitive nuclear technologies.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:32.881
As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,

00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:34.348
mostly of facilities,

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:36.619
industrial facilities around the world.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.307
And I was always looking for a better canvas

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.373
to tie these all together.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.239
And one day, I was thinking about how

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.363
all data has a location,

00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:47.096
and I realized that the answer

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.984
had been staring me in the face.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:51.622
Although I was a satellite engineer,

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:54.793
I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:56.359
in my work.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.306
Now, like most of us, I'd been online,

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:00.088
I'd see my house, so I thought,

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:02.386
I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up

00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:03.803
some of these facilities.

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:05.772
And what I found really surprised me.

00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:07.446
The pictures that I was finding

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.347
were years out of date,

00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:10.415
and because of that,

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:12.086
it had relatively little relevance

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.546
to the work that I was doing today.

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:16.007
But I was intrigued.

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.243
I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.

00:01:19.243 --> 00:01:21.546
There are millions and millions of sensors

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:22.990
surrounding us today,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.950
but there's still so much we
don't know on a daily basis.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.703
How much oil is stored in all of China?

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:32.636
How much corn is being produced?

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:36.707
How many ships are in all of our world's ports?

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:39.266
Now, in theory, all of these questions

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.510
could be answered by imagery,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.237
but not if it's old.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.695
And if this data was so valuable,

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:47.627
then how come I couldn't get my hands

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:50.177
on more recent pictures?

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:53.312
So the story begins over 50 years ago

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.183
with the launch of the first generation

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:58.783
of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.

00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:00.479
And today, there's a handful

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.674
of the great, great grandchildren

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:04.339
of these early Cold War machines

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:06.348
which are now operated by private companies

00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:09.057
and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery

00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:11.882
that you and I see on a daily basis comes.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:14.796
During this period, launching things into space,

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:17.473
just the rocket to get the satellite up there,

00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:22.074
has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.826
and that's created tremendous pressure

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:26.115
to launch things infrequently

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:27.459
and to make sure that when you do,

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.098
you cram as much functionality in there as possible.

00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:32.709
All of this has only made satellites

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.126
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:36.724
and more expensive,

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:41.761
now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.460
Because they are so expensive,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.927
there aren't very many of them.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:46.272
Because there aren't very many of them,

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:48.728
the pictures that we see on a daily basis

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:50.232
tend to be old.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.514
I think a lot of people actually
understand this anecdotally,

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:56.053
but in order to visualize just how sparsely

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:57.937
our planet is collected,

00:02:57.937 --> 00:03:00.003
some friends and I put together a dataset

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.590
of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.074
by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:08.829
As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.619
are barely seen, less than once a year,

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.891
and even the areas that are seen most frequently,

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:17.639
those in red, are seen at best once a quarter.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.555
Now as aerospace engineering grad students,

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.983
this chart cried out to us as a challenge.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:27.438
Why do these things have to be so expensive?

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:30.173
Does a single satellite really have to cost

00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:34.936
the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.099
Wasn't there a way to build a smaller,

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.271
simpler, new satellite design that could enable

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.289
more timely imaging?

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.740
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.251
that we were going to go out and just

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.098
begin designing satellites,

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:51.061
but fortunately we had help.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:53.996
In the late 1990s, a couple of professors

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:57.477
proposed a concept for radically reducing the price

00:03:57.477 --> 00:03:59.249
of putting things in space.

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.360
This was hitchhiking small satellites

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.376
alongside much larger satellites.

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:07.285
This dropped the cost of putting objects up there

00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:09.283
by over a factor of 100,

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:12.369
and suddenly we could afford to experiment,

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.837
to take a little bit of risk,

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.103
and to realize a lot of innovation.

00:04:16.103 --> 00:04:19.192
And a new generation of engineers and scientists,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.791
mostly out of universities,

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.134
began launching these very small,

00:04:23.134 --> 00:04:25.725
breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:28.128
And these were built with electronics obtained

00:04:28.128 --> 00:04:32.026
from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.866
Now it was using the lessons
learned from these early missions

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:37.561
that my friends and I began a series of sketches

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.250
of our own satellite design.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.034
And I can't remember a specific day

00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:43.894
where we made a conscious decision

00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:46.529
that we were actually going to
go out and build these things,

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.959
but once we got that idea in our minds

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:51.120
of the world as a dataset,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.610
of being able to capture millions of data points

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.663
on a daily basis describing the global economy,

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.183
of being able to unearth billions of connections

00:04:59.183 --> 00:05:02.348
between them that had never before been found,

00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:03.996
it just seemed boring

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:06.903
to go work on anything else.

00:05:06.903 --> 00:05:09.876
And so we moved into a cramped,

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.855
windowless office in Palo Alto,

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.822
and began working to take our design

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:17.760
from the drawing board into the lab.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.418
The first major question we had to tackle

00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:22.752
was just how big to build this thing.

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:25.935
In space, size drives cost,

00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:27.948
and we had worked with these very small,

00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:30.042
breadbox-sized satellites in school,

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:32.593
but as we began to better
understand the laws of physics,

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:34.715
we found that the quality of pictures

00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:37.799
those satellites could take was very limited,

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.503
because the laws of physics dictate

00:05:39.503 --> 00:05:42.609
that the best picture you
can take through a telescope

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.848
is a function of the diameter of that telescope,

00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:46.510
and these satellites had a very small,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.216
very constrained volume.

00:05:48.216 --> 00:05:50.011
And we found that the best picture we would

00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.496
have been able to get looked something like this.

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:54.741
Although this was the low-cost option,

00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:56.414
quite frankly it was just too blurry

00:05:56.414 --> 00:05:59.983
to see the things that make
satellite imagery valuable.

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:02.129
So about three or four weeks later,

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.946
we met a group of engineers randomly

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:06.587
who had worked on the first

00:06:06.587 --> 00:06:09.028
private imaging satellite ever developed,

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:11.146
and they told us that back in the 1970s,

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:13.328
the U.S. government had found a powerful

00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:14.971
optimal tradeoff --

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:18.059
that in taking pictures at right
about one meter resolution,

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.943
being able to see objects one meter in size,

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.634
they had found that they could not
just get very high-quality images,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.527
but get a lot of them at an affordable price.

00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:28.503
From our own computer simulations,

00:06:28.503 --> 00:06:30.508
we quickly found that one meter really was

00:06:30.508 --> 00:06:32.272
the minimum viable product

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:35.351
to be able to see the drivers of our global economy,

00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.912
for the first time, being able to count

00:06:36.912 --> 00:06:39.633
the ships and cars and shipping
containers and trucks

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.457
that move around our world on a daily basis,

00:06:42.457 --> 00:06:46.261
while conveniently still not
being able to see individuals.

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:47.882
We had found our compromise.

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:49.486
We would have to build something larger

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:51.049
than the original breadbox,

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:52.700
now more like a mini-fridge,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.461
but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.

00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.085
So now we had our constraint.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.842
The laws of physics dictated

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:03.166
the absolute minimum-sized
telescope that we could build.

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:06.220
What came next was making the rest of the satellite

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.961
as small and as simple as possible,

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.613
basically a flying telescope with four walls

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:13.554
and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book

00:07:13.554 --> 00:07:16.992
that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.

00:07:16.992 --> 00:07:18.892
The big challenge became actually taking

00:07:18.892 --> 00:07:21.090
the pictures through that telescope.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.134
Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,

00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:25.895
similar to a Xerox machine,

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.295
and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,

00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:30.491
scanning row by row by row

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:32.166
to build the complete image.

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:35.170
Now people use these because they get a lot of light,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.001
which means less of the noise you see

00:07:37.016 --> 00:07:39.752
in a low-cost cell phone image.

00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:42.113
The problem with them is they require

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.353
very sophisticated pointing.

00:07:44.353 --> 00:07:46.899
You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.651
from over 600 miles away

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.883
while moving at more than
seven kilometers a second,

00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:53.632
which requires an awesome degree of complexity.

00:07:53.632 --> 00:07:57.069
So instead, we turned to a new
generation of video sensors,

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.160
originally created for use in night vision goggles.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.059
Instead of taking a single, high quality image,

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:04.446
we could take a videostream

00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:07.369
of individually noisier frames,

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:09.113
but then we could recombine

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.579
all of those frames together

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.575
into very high-quality images

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.168
using sophisticated pixel processing techniques

00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:16.689
here on the ground,

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:19.826
at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.

00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:20.979
And we applied this technique

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:23.953
to many of the other systems on the satellite as well,

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.793
and day by day, our design evolved

00:08:26.793 --> 00:08:30.282
from CAD to prototypes

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:33.170
to production units.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.827
A few short weeks ago,

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:36.678
we packed up SkySat 1,

00:08:36.678 --> 00:08:38.451
put our signatures on it,

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.674
and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.

00:08:40.674 --> 00:08:44.155
Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration

00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:47.216
ready to blast off in a few short weeks.

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:49.558
And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching

00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:52.589
a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:55.139
and beginning to build the scalable analytics

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:57.478
that will allow us to unearth the insights

00:08:57.478 --> 00:09:00.667
in the petabytes of data we will collect.

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:04.640
So why do all of this? Why build these satellites?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.251
Well, it turns out imaging satellites

00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:10.961
have a unique ability to provide global transparency,

00:09:10.961 --> 00:09:13.587
and providing that transparency on a timely basis

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:16.998
is simply an idea whose time has come.

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:20.521
We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,

00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.285
and beyond economic data,

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:25.886
unlocking the human story, moment by moment.

00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:27.449
For a data scientist

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:30.199
that just happened to go to space camp as a kid,

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:32.914
it just doesn't get much better than that.

00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:35.129
Thank you.

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:39.263
(Applause)
