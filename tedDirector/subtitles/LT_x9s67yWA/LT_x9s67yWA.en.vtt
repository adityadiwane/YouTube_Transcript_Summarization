00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
If I can leave you with one big idea today,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
it's that the whole of the data

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
in which we consume

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
is greater that the sum of the parts,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
and instead of thinking about information overload,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
what I'd like you to think about is how

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
we can use information so that patterns pop

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
organized by age.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.260
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
This is because, in the mid-area here,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
people are at their most active,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and over here they're at their most frail.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
We can step back out again

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and then reorganize the data by cause of death,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
If we go ahead and we filter by age --

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
say 40 years or less --

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we see that accidents are actually

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
So you get the idea

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that viewing information, viewing data in this way,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
is a lot like swimming

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
in a living information info-graphic.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
And if we can do this for raw data,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
why not do it for content as well?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
So what we have right here

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
ever produced.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
It's all here; it's all on the web.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
You can drill into a particular year.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
You can jump right into a specific issue.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
that have appeared in this issue, the sports.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
which reveals, for me, all the issues

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
(Applause)

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
I might think,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
So I can step back, and expand on that.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And I see Greg LeMond now.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
And so you get the idea that when you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
navigate over information this way --

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
going narrower, broader,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
backing in, backing out --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
you're not searching, you're not browsing.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
It's in between, and we think it changes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
the way information can be used.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
with something that's a little bit crazy.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
and we reduced it down to a little summary.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
I'm only showing the top 500

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
most popular Wikipedia pages right here.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
But even in this limited view,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
we can do a lot of things.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
that are most popular on Wikipedia.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I'm going to go ahead and select government.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
Now, having selected government,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I can now see that the Wikipedia categories

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that most frequently correspond to that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
are Time magazine People of the Year.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
So this is really important because this is an insight

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
It's only possible to see that insight

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
when you step back and look at all of them.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Looking at one of these particular summaries,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
I can then drill into the concept of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Time magazine Person of the Year,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
bringing up all of them.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
So looking at these people,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
I can see that the majority come from government;

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
some have come from natural sciences;

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
some, fewer still, have come from business --

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
there's my boss --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and one has come from music.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
And interestingly enough,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Bono is also a TED Prize winner.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
but at a higher level of abstraction.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
And so I want to show you one other thing

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
that may catch you a little bit by surprise.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
So Pivot, this application --

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
but you can view web pages with it --

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
and we bring that zoomable technology

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
to every single web page like this.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
So I can step back,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
pop right back into a specific section.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Now the reason why this is important is because,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
I can look at my entire browsing history

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
in the exact same way.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
So I can drill into what I've done

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
over specific time frames.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
Here, in fact, is the state

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
of all the demo that I just gave.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And, if I want to step back and look at everything,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
I can slice and dice my history,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
perhaps by my search history --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And from these, I can drill into the web page

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
and just launch them again.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and in each case it makes the whole greater

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
than the sum of the parts with the data.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So right now, in this world,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
we think about data as being this curse.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
We talk about the curse of information overload.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
We talk about drowning in data.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
What if we can actually turn that upside down

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and turn the web upside down,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
and then being able to see the patterns

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
that were otherwise hidden?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.260
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
we might actually extract information.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And, instead of dealing just with information,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
we can tease out knowledge.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
So with that, I thank you.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:15.260
(Applause)
