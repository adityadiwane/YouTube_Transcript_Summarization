00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
In his inaugural address,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.160
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
But what did he appeal to?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
and tell us to just go shopping.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.160
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Invest, invest, invest."

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
And he appealed to virtue.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.160
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
And besides, some of you might be wondering,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
what the hell does it mean?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
Let me begin with an example.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
This is the job description of a hospital janitor

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
that is scrolling up on the screen.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
They're the things you would expect:

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160
mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
It may be a little surprising how many things there are,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
but it's not surprising what they are.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
even though this is a very long list,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.160
there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.160
Not one.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
they encountered Mike,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160
trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.160
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
because there were some family members who were there all day, every day

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
And then there was Luke,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
didn't see Luke do it the first time,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
and his father was angry.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.160
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
doesn't just make people feel a little better,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
it actually improves the quality of patient care

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
and enables hospitals to run well.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.160
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
involving kindness, care and empathy

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
are an essential part of the job.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.160
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.160
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.160
"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.160
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.160
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.160
A wise person knows how to improvise,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.160
as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160
and the context is always changing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
A wise person is like a jazz musician --

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.160
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.160
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.160
in the service of the right aims.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.160
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
And finally, perhaps most important,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
a wise person is made, not born.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Wisdom depends on experience,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
and not just any experience.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
You need permission to be allowed to improvise,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160
try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
how hard it is to learn to do their job,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.160
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.160
At TED, brilliance is rampant.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
It's scary.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.160
The bad news is that without wisdom,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
brilliance isn't enough.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.160
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
(Applause)

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
Now, I hope that we all know this.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160
There's a sense in which it's obvious,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.160
and yet, let me tell you a little story.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
It's a story about lemonade.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.160
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
His son asked him for some lemonade

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160
which was five percent alcohol.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
So he brought it back.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160
and called the police, who called an ambulance

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.160
that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.160
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
And they were ready to let the kid go.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
But not so fast.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160
At that point, can the child go home?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:03.160
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
After two weeks, I'm happy to report,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160
the family was reunited.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
and the judge all said the same thing:

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160
"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160
How do things like this happen?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.160
said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160
but they spare you from thinking."

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.160
because previous officials have been lax

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
and they let a child go back to an abusive household.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160
Fair enough.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160
When things go wrong, as of course they do,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.160
we reach for two tools to try to fix them.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.160
One tool we reach for is rules.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Better ones, more of them.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
The second tool we reach for is incentives.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.160
Better ones, more of them.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.160
What else, after all, is there?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.160
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
Regulate, regulate, regulate.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.160
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.160
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.160
are enough to do the job.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.160
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160
It's preposterous on its face.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
but they create a downward spiral

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
that makes them worse in the long run.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
that deprives us of the opportunity

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160
to improvise and learn from our improvisations.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.160
And moral will is undermined

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.160
by an incessant appeal to incentives

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.160
that destroy our desire to do the right thing.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160
And without intending it,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.160
by appealing to rules and incentives,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
we are engaging in a war on wisdom.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160
Let me just give you a few examples,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
first of rules and the war on moral skill.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
The lemonade story is one.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Second, no doubt more familiar to you,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
is the nature of modern American education:

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.160
scripted, lock-step curricula.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.160
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
Reading and enjoying literature

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
and words that begin with 'B.'

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160
"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.160
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
We know why these scripts are there.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160
to let them loose on their own.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160
And they prevent disaster.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.160
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.160
(Applause)

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160
Don't get me wrong. We need rules!

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
Jazz musicians need some notes --

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
most of them need some notes on the page.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.160
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
from improvising.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
And as a result, they lose their gifts,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
or worse, they stop playing altogether.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.160
Now, how about incentives?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
They seem cleverer.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
If you have one reason for doing something

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
and you're more likely to do it.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
Right?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
Well, not always.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160
instead of complimenting,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
and they make people less likely to do it.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.160
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.160
There was going to be a national referendum.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.160
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.160
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
They knew it was dangerous.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
They thought it would reduce their property values.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
But it had to go somewhere

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
and they had responsibilities as citizens.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.160
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.160
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160
Instead of 50 percent saying yes,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
25 percent said yes.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
What happens is that

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.160
the second this introduction of incentive gets us

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160
so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160
When incentives don't work,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.160
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.160
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.160
the response is always the same.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
Get smarter incentives.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160
that are ever going to be smart enough.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.160
We need incentives. People have to make a living.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.160
But excessive reliance on incentives

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160
demoralizes professional activity

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
in two senses of that word.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.160
"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.160
And when professions are demoralized,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.160
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.160
and they stop asking "Is it right?"

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.160
We see this in medicine.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.160
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
And we certainly see it in the world of business.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.160
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.160
("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.160
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
So what can we do?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.160
A few sources of hope:

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160
we ought to try to re-moralize work.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.160
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.160
(Applause)

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.160
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.160
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.160
What to do instead?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.160
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.160
Acknowledge, when you go to law school,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
that a little voice is whispering in your ear

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.160
about Atticus Finch.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
People are inspired by moral heroes.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.160
But we learn that with sophistication

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160
comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
Well, acknowledge them.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160
Be proud that you have them.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
Celebrate them.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.160
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160
That's one thing we can do.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.160
I don't know how many of you remember this:

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.160
another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.160
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.160
they made Polartec --

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.160
The factory burned down.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.160
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.160
and for the community if he had let them go.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.160
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160
Two were particularly inspiring to me.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160
(Applause)

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.160
-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.160
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
And a bonus he's discovering is

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
he's actually going to make even more money.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.160
His employees are inspired by the effort.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.160
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.160
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.160
(Applause)

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160
In many ways this is the perfect example.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.160
Because it took the will to do the right thing.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.160
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
in order to plot this out.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160
But most important to make it work --

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.160
and he emphasized this --

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.160
is that it took knowing the people in the communities.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.160
Unless the people you're working with are behind you,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
this will fail.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.160
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
because different people in different communities

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160
organize their lives in different ways.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
There are ordinary heroes.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.160
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
As heads of organizations,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
we should strive to create environments

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.160
will give up if they have to swim against the current

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.160
in the organizations in which they work.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
If you run an organization, you should be sure

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.160
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160
Because the truth is that

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
is moral work.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.160
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.160
And, perhaps most important,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.160
as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.160
the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.160
One is that we are always teaching.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.160
Someone is always watching.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
The camera is always on.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
"Knowledge is power."

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
that KIPP is doing

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.160
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
that Bill didn't mention.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.160
That is that they have come to the realization

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
that the single most important thing kids need to learn

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160
is character.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
They need to learn to respect themselves.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.160
They need to learn to respect their teachers.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.160
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160
That's the principle objective.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.160
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.160
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:13.160
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
Obama appealed to virtue.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
And I think he was right.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.160
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:28.160
because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.160
He also appealed to hope.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160
Right again.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160
I think there is reason for hope.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.160
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.160
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.160
Wanting to do the right thing

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
in the right way

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
for the right reasons.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.160
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.160
if only we start paying attention.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
Paying attention to what we do,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
to how we do it,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.160
and, perhaps most importantly,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.160
to the structure of the organizations within which we work,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.160
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
rather than having it suppressed.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
Thank you very much.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.160
Thank you.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160
(Applause)

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160
Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.160
(Applause)
