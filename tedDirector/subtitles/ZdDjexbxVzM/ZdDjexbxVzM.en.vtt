00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:16.420
If you look deep into the night sky,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.036
you see stars,

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:20.608
and if you look further, you see more stars,

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:22.767
and further, galaxies, and 
further, more galaxies.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.640
But if you keep looking further and further,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.756
eventually you see nothing for a long while,

00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:34.218
and then finally you see a
faint, fading afterglow,

00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:37.242
and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.059
Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.230
when everything we see in the night sky

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.640
was condensed into an incredibly small,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.966
incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.658
and from it sprung everything we see.

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:54.517
Now, we've mapped that afterglow

00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:56.196
with great precision,

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.240
and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.116
We've mapped the afterglow

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:01.438
with spectacular precision,

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:02.986
and one of the shocks about it

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.932
is that it's almost completely uniform.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.890
Fourteen billion light years that way

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.750
and 14 billion light years that way,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.158
it's the same temperature.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:14.472
Now it's been 14 billion years

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.290
since that Big Bang,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.762
and so it's got faint and cold.

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:21.070
It's now 2.7 degrees.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.350
But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.644
It's only 2.7 degrees to about

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.486
10 parts in a million.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.480
Over here, it's a little hotter,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.348
and over there, it's a little cooler,

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:33.436
and that's incredibly important
to everyone in this room,

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:35.160
because where it was a little hotter,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.856
there was a little more stuff,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:38.423
and where there was a little more stuff,

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:40.392
we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.644
and superclusters

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:44.352
and all the structure you see in the cosmos.

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:47.464
And those small, little, inhomogeneities,

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:49.746
20 parts in a million,

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:52.500
those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.308
in that early universe that were stretched

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.587
across the size of the entire cosmos.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:58.301
That is spectacular,

00:01:58.301 --> 00:01:59.966
and that's not what they found on Monday;

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.002
what they found on Monday is cooler.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.268
So here's what they found on Monday:

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:07.771
Imagine you take a bell,

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:09.382
and you whack the bell with a hammer.

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.058
What happens? It rings.

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:13.266
But if you wait, that ringing fades

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.886
and fades and fades

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.828
until you don't notice it anymore.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.476
Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:21.555
like a metal, way denser,

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.960
and if you hit it, it would ring,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.823
but the thing ringing would be

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:27.911
the structure of space-time itself,

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.727
and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:32.658
What they found on Monday

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:35.020
was evidence of the ringing

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.335
of the space-time of the early universe,

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:39.440
what we call gravitational waves

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.960
from the fundamental era,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.935
and here's how they found it.

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.007
Those waves have long since faded.

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:46.495
If you go for a walk,

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:48.083
you don't wiggle.

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:50.831
Those gravitational waves in the structure of space

00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:53.605
are totally invisible for all practical purposes.

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:56.509
But early on, when the universe was making

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.879
that last afterglow,

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.437
the gravitational waves

00:03:00.437 --> 00:03:03.300
put little twists in the structure

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.827
of the light that we see.

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:07.793
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:10.431
in fact, these guys spent
three years on the South Pole

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:13.020
looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.370
cleanest air they possibly could find

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.799
looking deep into the night sky and studying

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.175
that glow and looking for the faint twists

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.523
which are the symbol, the signal,

00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:25.343
of gravitational waves,

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:27.684
the ringing of the early universe.

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:29.471
And on Monday, they announced

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.215
that they had found it.

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:33.642
And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:36.390
is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.748
The thing that's totally amazing,

00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:39.850
the reason I'm on this stage, is because

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.318
what that tells us is something
deep about the early universe.

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:44.982
It tells us that we

00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:46.418
and everything we see around us

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:49.372
are basically one large bubble --

00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:51.128
and this is the idea of inflationâ€”

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:55.020
one large bubble surrounded by something else.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.150
This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.324
but anything that isn't inflation that explains this

00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:00.641
will look the same.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.286
This is a theory, an idea,

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:03.510
that has been around for a while,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.235
and we never thought we we'd really see it.

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.073
For good reasons, we thought we'd never see

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:09.321
killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.

00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.331
But the really crazy idea

00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:14.363
is that our bubble is just one bubble

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:18.989
in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.815
We're never going to see the stuff outside,

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:23.389
but by going to the South Pole
and spending three years

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.949
looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.805
we can figure out

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.895
that we're probably in a universe
that looks kind of like that.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.317
And that amazes me.

00:04:33.317 --> 00:04:34.653
Thanks a lot.

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:37.589
(Applause)
