00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
Science.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.176
The very word for many of you conjures
unhappy memories of boredom

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.096
in high school biology or physics class.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.216
But let me assure that what you did there

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.416
had very little to do with science.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.736
That was really the "what" of science.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.480
It was the history
of what other people had discovered.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.056
What I'm most interested in as a scientist

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.216
is the "how" of science.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.056
Because science is knowledge in process.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.536
We make an observation,
guess an explanation for that observation,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.616
and then make a prediction
that we can test

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.560
with an experiment or other observation.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.416
A couple of examples.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.016
First of all, people noticed
that the Earth was below, the sky above,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.920
and both the Sun and the Moon
seemed to go around them.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.256
Their guessed explanation

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.360
was that the Earth must be
the center of the universe.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.440
The prediction: everything
should circle around the Earth.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.776
This was first really tested

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.616
when Galileo got his hands
on one of the first telescopes,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.016
and as he gazed into the night sky,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.736
what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.760
with four moons circling around it.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.136
He then used those moons
to follow the path of Jupiter

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.896
and found that Jupiter
also was not going around the Earth

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.880
but around the Sun.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.440
So the prediction test failed.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.496
And this led to
the discarding of the theory

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.696
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.816
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton
noticed that things fall to the Earth.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.760
The guessed explanation was gravity,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.656
the prediction that everything
should fall to the Earth.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.240
But of course, not everything
does fall to the Earth.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.760
So did we discard gravity?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.336
No. We revised the theory and said,
gravity pulls things to the Earth

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.560
unless there is an equal
and opposite force in the other direction.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.320
This led us to learn something new.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.176
We began to pay more attention
to the bird and the bird's wings,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.576
and just think of all the discoveries

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.639
that have flown
from that line of thinking.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.776
So the test failures,
the exceptions, the outliers

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.360
teach us what we don't know
and lead us to something new.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.200
This is how science moves forward.
This is how science learns.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.096
Sometimes in the media,
and even more rarely,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.536
but sometimes even scientists will say

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.320
that something or other
has been scientifically proven.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.456
But I hope that you understand
that science never proves anything

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360
definitively forever.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.336
Hopefully science remains curious enough

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.776
to look for

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.776
and humble enough to recognize

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.296
when we have found

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.016
the next outlier,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.536
the next exception,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.856
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.480
teaches us what we don't actually know.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.696
We're going to change gears
here for a second.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.656
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.136
means a lot of different things
to different people,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.416
but most of our
public discourse on medicine

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.216
really turns it into
an engineering problem.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.976
We have the hallways of Congress,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and the boardrooms of insurance companies
that try to figure out how to pay for it.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.296
The ethicists and epidemiologists

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.016
try to figure out
how best to distribute medicine,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.696
and the hospitals and physicians
are absolutely obsessed

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.656
with their protocols and checklists,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.216
trying to figure out
how best to safely apply medicine.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.360
These are all good things.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.696
However, they also all assume

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.696
at some level

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.240
that the textbook of medicine is closed.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.656
We start to measure
the quality of our health care

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.216
by how quickly we can access it.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.336
It doesn't surprise me
that in this climate,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.176
many of our institutions
for the provision of health care

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.696
start to look a heck of a lot
like Jiffy Lube.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.296
(Laughter)

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.256
The only problem is that
when I graduated from medical school,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.336
I didn't get one of those
little doohickeys

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.736
that your mechanic
has to plug into your car

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.136
and find out exactly what's wrong with it,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.256
because the textbook of medicine

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.800
is not closed.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.160
Medicine is science.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.240
Medicine is knowledge in process.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.656
We make an observation,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.815
we guess an explanation
of that observation,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:33.456
and then we make a prediction
that we can test.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.056
Now, the testing ground
of most predictions in medicine

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.616
is populations.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.216
And you may remember
from those boring days in biology class

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.416
that populations tend to distribute

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.656
around a mean

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.536
as a Gaussian or a normal curve.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.216
Therefore, in medicine,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.456
after we make a prediction
from a guessed explanation,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.360
we test it in a population.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.256
That means that what we know in medicine,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.536
our knowledge and our know-how,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.816
comes from populations

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.616
but extends only as far

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.376
as the next outlier,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.616
the next exception,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.376
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.800
will teach us what we don't actually know.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.416
Now, I am a surgeon

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.856
who looks after patients with sarcoma.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.080
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.760
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.576
And I would tell you that every one
of my patients is an outlier,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.800
is an exception.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.216
There is no surgery I have ever performed
for a sarcoma patient

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.496
that has ever been guided
by a randomized controlled clinical trial,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.240
what we consider the best kind
of population-based evidence in medicine.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.696
People talk about thinking
outside the box,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.456
but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.816
What we do have as we take
a bath in the uncertainty

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.976
and unknowns and exceptions
and outliers that surround us in sarcoma

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.536
is easy access to what I think
are those two most important values

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.096
for any science:

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.320
humility and curiosity.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.296
Because if I am humble and curious,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.616
when a patient asks me a question,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.080
and I don't know the answer,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.136
I'll ask a colleague

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.176
who may have a similar
albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.896
We'll even establish
international collaborations.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.056
Those patients will start
to talk to each other through chat rooms

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.280
and support groups.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.376
It's through this kind
of humbly curious communication

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.960
that we begin to try and learn new things.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.296
As an example, this is a patient of mine

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.000
who had a cancer near his knee.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.856
Because of humbly curious communication

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.976
in international collaborations,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.536
we have learned that we can repurpose
the ankle to serve as the knee

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.816
when we have to remove the knee
with the cancer.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.680
He can then wear a prosthetic
and run and jump and play.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.376
This opportunity was available to him

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.176
because of international collaborations.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.896
It was desirable to him

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.880
because he had contacted other patients
who had experienced it.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.976
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.960
teach us what we don't know,
but also lead us to new thinking.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.936
Now, very importantly,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.816
all the new thinking that outliers
and exceptions lead us to in medicine

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.200
does not only apply
to the outliers and exceptions.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.096
It is not that we only learn
from sarcoma patients

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.080
ways to manage sarcoma patients.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.976
Sometimes, the outliers

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.696
and the exceptions

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.960
teach us things that matter quite a lot
to the general population.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.216
Like a tree standing outside a forest,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.256
the outliers and the exceptions
draw our attention

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.616
and lead us into a much greater sense
of perhaps what a tree is.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.136
We often talk about
losing the forests for the trees,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.976
but one also loses a tree

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.520
within a forest.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.856
But the tree that stands out by itself

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.776
makes those relationships
that define a tree,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.616
the relationships between trunk
and roots and branches,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.880
much more apparent.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.056
Even if that tree is crooked

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.056
or even if that tree
has very unusual relationships

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.376
between trunk and roots and branches,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.096
it nonetheless draws our attention

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.016
and allows us to make observations

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.280
that we can then test
in the general population.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.976
I told you that sarcomas are rare.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.640
They make up about one percent
of all cancers.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.240
You also probably know that cancer
is considered a genetic disease.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.176
By genetic disease we mean
that cancer is caused by oncogenes

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.576
that are turned on in cancer

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.640
and tumor suppressor genes
that are turned off to cause cancer.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.576
You might think
that we learned about oncogenes

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.816
and tumor suppressor genes
from common cancers

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.816
like breast cancer and prostate cancer

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.336
and lung cancer,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.559
but you'd be wrong.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.895
We learned about oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.135
for the first time

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:53.600
in that itty-bitty little one percent
of cancers called sarcoma.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.336
In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.376
for realizing that chickens

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.520
had a transmissible form of sarcoma.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.096
Thirty years later, Harold Varmus
and Mike Bishop discovered

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.656
what that transmissible element was.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.256
It was a virus

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.696
carrying a gene,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.160
the src oncogene.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.536
Now, I will not tell you
that src is the most important oncogene.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.776
I will not tell you

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.296
that src is the most frequently
turned on oncogene in all of cancer.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.760
But it was the first oncogene.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.296
The exception, the outlier

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.840
drew our attention and led us to something

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.560
that taught us very important things
about the rest of biology.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.976
Now, TP53 is the most important
tumor suppressor gene.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.736
It is the most frequently turned off
tumor suppressor gene

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.560
in almost every kind of cancer.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.656
But we didn't learn about it
from common cancers.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.096
We learned about it
when doctors Li and Fraumeni

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.696
were looking at families,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.736
and they realized that these families

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.280
had way too many sarcomas.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.696
I told you that sarcoma is rare.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.896
Remember that a one
in a million diagnosis,

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.056
if it happens twice in one family,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.480
is way too common in that family.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.336
The very fact that these are rare

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.800
draws our attention

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.000
and leads us to new kinds of thinking.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.936
Now, many of you may say,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.496
and may rightly say,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.416
that yeah, Kevin, that's great,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.496
but you're not talking
about a bird's wing.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.000
You're not talking about moons
floating around some planet Jupiter.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.056
This is a person.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.336
This outlier, this exception,
may lead to the advancement of science,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.560
but this is a person.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.896
And all I can say

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.280
is that I know that all too well.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.160
I have conversations with these patients
with rare and deadly diseases.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.736
I write about these conversations.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.056
These conversations are terribly fraught.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.896
They're fraught with horrible phrases

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.160
like "I have bad news"
or "There's nothing more we can do."

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.960
Sometimes these conversations
turn on a single word:

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.960
"terminal."

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.840
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.936
Where the blanks are in medicine

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.816
can be just as important

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.080
as the words that we use
in these conversations.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.616
What are the unknowns?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.840
What are the experiments
that are being done?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.376
Do this little exercise with me.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.616
Up there on the screen,
you see this phrase, "no where."

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.920
Notice where the blank is.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.880
If we move that blank one space over

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.216
"no where"

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.936
becomes "now here,"

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.856
the exact opposite meaning,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.080
just by shifting the blank one space over.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.256
I'll never forget the night

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.520
that I walked into
one of my patients' rooms.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.936
I had been operating long that day

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.976
but I still wanted to come and see him.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.200
He was a boy I had diagnosed
with a bone cancer a few days before.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.896
He and his mother had been meeting
with the chemotherapy doctors

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.136
earlier that day,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.136
and he had been admitted
to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.336
It was almost midnight
when I got to his room.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.536
He was asleep, but I found his mother

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.136
reading by flashlight

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.616
next to his bed.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.440
She came out in the hall
to chat with me for a few minutes.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.376
It turned out that
what she had been reading

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.576
was the protocol
that the chemotherapy doctors

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.840
had given her that day.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.440
She had memorized it.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.736
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.936
that we don't always win

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.240
with this type of cancer,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.160
but I've been studying this protocol,
and I think I can do it.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.536
I think I can comply
with these very difficult treatments.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.536
I'm going to quit my job.
I'm going to move in with my parents.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.520
I'm going to keep my baby safe."

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.520
I didn't tell her.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.760
I didn't stop to correct her thinking.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.936
She was trusting in a protocol

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.176
that even if complied with,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.600
wouldn't necessarily save her son.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.160
I didn't tell her.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.760
I didn't fill in that blank.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.056
But a year and a half later

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.800
her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.720
Should I have told her?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.616
Now, many of you may say, "So what?

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.896
I don't have sarcoma.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.816
No one in my family has sarcoma.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.296
And this is all fine and well,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.016
but it probably doesn't
matter in my life."

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.296
And you're probably right.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.000
Sarcoma may not matter
a whole lot in your life.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.376
But where the blanks are in medicine

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.720
does matter in your life.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.816
I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.216
I told you that in medicine,
we test predictions in populations,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.496
but I didn't tell you,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.736
and so often medicine never tells you

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.616
that every time an individual

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.736
encounters medicine,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.800
even if that individual is firmly
embedded in the general population,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.736
neither the individual
nor the physician knows

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.440
where in that population
the individual will land.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.736
Therefore, every encounter with medicine

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.200
is an experiment.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.936
You will be a subject

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.640
in an experiment.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.400
And the outcome will be either
a better or a worse result for you.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.336
As long as medicine works well,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.376
we're fine with fast service,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.840
bravado, brimmingly
confident conversations.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.376
But when things don't work well,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.240
sometimes we want something different.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.800
A colleague of mine
removed a tumor from a patient's limb.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.736
He was concerned about this tumor.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.776
In our physician conferences,
he talked about his concern

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.216
that this was a type of tumor

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.800
that had a high risk
for coming back in the same limb.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.656
But his conversations with the patient

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.776
were exactly what a patient might want:

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.056
brimming with confidence.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.096
He said, "I got it all
and you're good to go."

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.856
She and her husband were thrilled.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.960
They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,
opened a bottle of champagne.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.336
The only problem was a few weeks later,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.456
she started to notice
another nodule in the same area.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.616
It turned out he hadn't gotten it all,
and she wasn't good to go.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.480
But what happened at this juncture
absolutely fascinates me.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.816
My colleague came to me and said,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.560
"Kevin, would you mind
looking after this patient for me?"

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.456
I said, "Why, you know the right thing
to do as well as I do.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.096
You haven't done anything wrong."

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.600
He said, "Please, just look
after this patient for me."

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.736
He was embarrassed --

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.160
not by what he had done,

00:15:37.154 --> 00:15:39.080
but by the conversation that he had had,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.200
by the overconfidence.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.216
So I performed
a much more invasive surgery

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.376
and had a very different conversation
with the patient afterwards.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.736
I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.176
and you're most likely good to go,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.360
but this is the experiment
that we're doing.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.056
This is what you're going to watch for.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.976
This is what I'm going to watch for.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.936
And we're going to work together
to find out if this surgery will work

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.280
to get rid of your cancer."

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.856
I can guarantee you, she and her husband

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.800
did not crack another bottle of champagne
after talking to me.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.456
But she was now a scientist,

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.840
not only a subject in her experiment.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.576
And so I encourage you

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.056
to seek humility and curiosity

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.280
in your physicians.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.736
Almost 20 billion times each year,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.696
a person walks into a doctor's office,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.000
and that person becomes a patient.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.840
You or someone you love
will be that patient sometime very soon.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.480
How will you talk to your doctors?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.840
What will you tell them?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.280
What will they tell you?

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.816
They cannot tell you

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.360
what they do not know,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.120
but they can tell you when they don't know

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.640
if only you'll ask.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.000
So please, join the conversation.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.416
Thank you.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.308
(Applause)
