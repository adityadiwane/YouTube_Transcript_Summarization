00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.113
This sound,

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:24.848
this smell,

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:28.953
this sight

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:32.481
all remind me of the campfires of my childhood,

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:39.877
when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.

00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:42.800
There was this wondrous ending

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.366
when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:51.347
It was dreaming time.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:54.684
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming,

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:58.394
although I'm known to make my dreams come true.

00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:01.685
Last year, I created a one-man show.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:05.918
For an hour and a half I shared with the audience

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:08.585
a lifetime of creativity,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:13.019
how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:15.368
And then TED challenged me:

00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:18.533
"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.923
(Laughter)

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:23.450
Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.713
But here I am.

00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:28.075
One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:30.276
in which every syllable, every second will have its importance

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.041
and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.459
No, no, no.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.340
No, the best way for me to start

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.009
is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.326
So please join me for a minute of silence.

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:03.446
Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:06.149
But hey, we're on TED time.

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:08.221
When I was six years old,

00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:11.019
I fell in love with magic.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.438
For Christmas I got a magic box

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:17.893
and a very old book on card manipulation.

00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:21.046
Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:25.279
than in all the silly little tricks in the box.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.545
So I looked in the book for the most difficult move,

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:32.167
and it was this.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.060
Now I'm not supposed to share that with you,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.357
but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:41.860
Now that manipulation

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.320
was broken down into seven moves

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.434
described over seven pages.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.029
One, two, three,

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.643
four, five, six and seven.

00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:56.244
And let me show you something else.

00:02:56.244 --> 00:03:06.693
The cards were bigger than my hands.

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:09.296
Two months later, six years old,

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:12.555
I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.695
And I go to see a famous magician

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.421
and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:18.761
Six years old.

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.143
The magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:25.029
You cannot do that in two seconds

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.494
and have a minuscule part of the card showing.

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:33.978
For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second

00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:38.100
and it has to be perfect."

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.713
Two years later, one -- zoop.

00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:50.530
And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.899
Passion is the motto

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.076
of all my actions.

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:03.301
As I'm studying magic,

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:05.918
juggling is mentioned repeatedly

00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:10.486
as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:14.801
Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:17.035
jugglers make objects fly.

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:20.963
So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.

00:04:20.963 --> 00:04:24.751
I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:29.202
and he agrees to sell me three clubs.

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.369
But in America you have to explain. What are clubs?

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:32.885
Nothing to do with golf.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:37.419
They are those beautiful oblong objects,

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.019
but quite difficult to make.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:40.885
They have to be precisely lathed.

00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:43.053
Oh, when I was buying the clubs,

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:46.202
somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.552
Well I didn't think much of it at the time.

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:52.518
Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.

00:04:52.518 --> 00:04:54.854
But I could not understand.

00:04:54.854 --> 00:04:58.620
I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.802
The clubs were escaping me at each throw.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.819
And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.952
Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.120
the world's greatest juggler.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.635
And he was frowning.

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:15.052
And he finally asked, "Can I see those?"

00:05:15.052 --> 00:05:17.418
So I proudly showed him my clubs.

00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:19.835
He said, "Philippe, you have been had.

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:23.236
These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.

00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:28.387
They are impossible to juggle."

00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:34.752
Tenacity is how I kept at it

00:05:34.752 --> 00:05:36.634
against all odds.

00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:40.186
So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,

00:05:40.186 --> 00:05:42.668
and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.

00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:44.586
It was more interesting; I heard.

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:46.953
I heard about those amazing men and women

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:49.638
who walk on thin air --

00:05:49.638 --> 00:05:52.494
the high-wire walkers.

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:56.156
Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,

00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:00.879
so that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.352
I found two trees --

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:07.538
but not any kind of trees,

00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:10.007
trees with character --

00:06:10.007 --> 00:06:11.756
and then a very long rope.

00:06:11.756 --> 00:06:13.541
And I put the rope around and around

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:16.006
and around and around and around till I had no more rope.

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.523
Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.

00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:21.043
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,

00:06:21.043 --> 00:06:26.475
and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.

00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:30.093
So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:33.571
What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.

00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.410
So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.593
and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.

00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:44.604
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.647
So I cut one rope off.

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.392
And the next day one rope off.

00:06:48.392 --> 00:06:53.191
And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:54.991
Now you can imagine at that time

00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:59.425
I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.

00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:04.392
So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try --

00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:07.862
this is how not to learn wire walking.

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.376
(Laughter)

00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:17.908
Intuition is a tool essential in my life.

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:22.526
In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:24.194
because instead of listening to the teachers,

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:28.225
I am my own teacher, progressing in my new art

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:31.359
and becoming a street juggler.

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:34.010
On the high wire, within months,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.692
I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,

00:07:36.692 --> 00:07:39.275
except I am not satisfied.

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:47.536
I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.

00:07:47.536 --> 00:07:50.240
But nobody wanted to hire me.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.659
So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:59.545
Notre Dame,

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:03.583
the Sydney Harbor Bridge,

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.677
the World Trade Center.

00:08:06.677 --> 00:08:08.950
And I developed a certitude, a faith

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.510
that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.262
If not, I will never do that first step.

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:17.461
Well nonetheless,

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:20.474
on the top of the World Trade Center

00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:28.371
my first step was terrifying.

00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.644
All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.

00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:35.480
Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.760
The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.493
whose chilling power I no longer feel.

00:08:42.493 --> 00:08:45.359
I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.091
I step over the beam.

00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.474
I put my left foot on the cable,

00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:53.858
the weight of my body raised on my right leg

00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:57.138
anchored to the flank of the building.

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:00.957
Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.474
My right leg will be unburdened,

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:06.977
my right foot will freely meet the wire.

00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:11.549
On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.

00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:14.274
On the other, the universe of the clouds,

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:17.842
so full of unknown we think it's empty.

00:09:17.842 --> 00:09:24.057
At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.

00:09:24.057 --> 00:09:27.438
It's a straight line, which sags,

00:09:27.438 --> 00:09:30.959
which sways, which vibrates,

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.523
which rolls on itself,

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:34.258
which is ice,

00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:38.627
which is three tons tight, ready to explode,

00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:41.241
ready to swallow me.

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:44.207
An inner howl assails me,

00:09:44.207 --> 00:09:47.224
the wild longing to flee.

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:49.691
But it is too late.

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:52.341
The wire is ready.

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:57.779
Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.

00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:09.473
Faith is what replaces doubt

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:11.503
in my dictionary.

00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:12.729
So after the walk

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:14.573
people ask me, "How can you top that?"

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:16.878
Well I didn't have that problem.

00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:19.480
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.562
in breaking records.

00:10:21.562 --> 00:10:26.591
In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing

00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:30.141
at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks --

00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:35.057
or some completely different type of performance.

00:10:35.057 --> 00:10:41.219
Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example.

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:43.687
So each time

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:46.908
I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement

00:10:46.908 --> 00:10:51.751
and enter as the improvising comic silent character

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.676
I created 45 years ago,

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:57.723
I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.678
But this here,

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.009
this is not the street.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:04.585
So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.

00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:06.758
So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?

00:11:06.758 --> 00:11:08.124
You know that, right?

00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:10.373
You don't want me to juggle, right?

00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:12.666
(Applause)

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:23.802
(Music)

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.498
(Applause)

00:13:15.498 --> 00:13:18.079
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.932
Each time I street juggle

00:13:32.932 --> 00:13:40.148
I use improvisation.

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:46.227
Now improvisation is empowering

00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:50.427
because it welcomes the unknown.

00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:54.559
And since what's impossible is always unknown,

00:13:54.559 --> 00:14:02.149
it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:04.593
Now I have done the impossible not once,

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.778
but many times.

00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:09.224
So what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:13.895
Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.861
by a high-wire walk.

00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:17.710
And I chose to put my wire

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.713
between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem

00:14:21.713 --> 00:14:23.644
over the Ben Hinnom Valley.

00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:25.811
And I thought it would be incredible

00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:27.634
if in the middle of the wire

00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:29.617
I stopped and, like a magician,

00:14:29.617 --> 00:14:33.382
I produce a dove and send her in the sky

00:14:33.382 --> 00:14:35.732
as a living symbol of peace.

00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:38.549
Well now I must say,

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:41.533
it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.

00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:44.457
And in my hotel room,

00:14:44.457 --> 00:14:49.437
each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.056
she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.

00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:54.821
So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.

00:14:54.821 --> 00:14:56.570
I mean, a bird needs space to fly.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.822
It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.

00:14:58.822 --> 00:15:02.203
Now comes the day of the walk.

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:05.853
Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.

00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:10.437
The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.

00:15:10.437 --> 00:15:13.322
But he seemed nervous.

00:15:13.322 --> 00:15:15.571
There was tension in my wire,

00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:17.686
but I also could feel tension on the ground.

00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:19.004
Because all those people

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:22.103
were made up of people who, for the most part,

00:15:22.103 --> 00:15:24.988
considered each other enemies.

00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:27.724
So I start the walk. Everything is fine.

00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:29.502
I stop in the middle.

00:15:29.502 --> 00:15:32.221
I make the dove appear.

00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:34.137
People applaud in delight.

00:15:34.137 --> 00:15:36.906
And then in the most magnificent gesture,

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:40.437
I send the bird of peace into the azure.

00:15:40.437 --> 00:15:42.186
But the bird, instead of flying away,

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:45.237
goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.

00:15:45.237 --> 00:15:47.321
(Laughter)

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.220
And people scream.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.838
So I grab the dove,

00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:56.634
and for the second time I send her in the air.

00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:59.807
But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,

00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:03.854
goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.

00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:05.170
(Laughter)

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.425
You laugh, you laugh. But hey.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.854
I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.

00:16:10.854 --> 00:16:14.073
Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.437
They must think this guy with this dove,

00:16:16.437 --> 00:16:18.603
he must have spent years working with him.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.020
What a genius, what a professional.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.991
(Laughter)

00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:24.970
So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.038
And at the end I bang my hand against the pole

00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:28.555
to dislodge the bird.

00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:32.204
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,

00:16:32.204 --> 00:16:34.955
does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop

00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:36.988
and ends up on the wire behind me.

00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:40.004
And the entire valley goes crazy.

00:16:40.004 --> 00:16:42.087
Now but hold on, I'm not finished.

00:16:42.087 --> 00:16:44.621
So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival

00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:47.270
and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.853
And something happened.

00:16:48.853 --> 00:16:51.322
Somebody somewhere, a group of people,

00:16:51.322 --> 00:16:54.504
starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.

00:16:54.504 --> 00:16:56.353
And within seconds the entire valley

00:16:56.353 --> 00:17:00.337
is applauding in unison with each of my steps.

00:17:00.337 --> 00:17:02.470
But not an applause of delight like before,

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.854
an applause encouragement.

00:17:05.854 --> 00:17:10.019
For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:14.968
They had become one, pushing me to triumph.

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:17.635
I want you just for a second

00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:20.648
to experience this amazing human symphony.

00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:23.784
So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.

00:17:23.784 --> 00:17:27.684
So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.

00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:33.898
(Clapping)

00:17:33.898 --> 00:17:38.200
(Applause)

00:17:40.323 --> 00:17:43.179
So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:46.832
And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.267
in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.684
He didn't know the true story.

00:17:50.684 --> 00:17:54.332
And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation

00:17:54.332 --> 00:17:56.732
to solve in this hard-to-manage city,

00:17:56.732 --> 00:17:59.750
instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.083
"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"

00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:05.702
and he goes back to work.

00:18:05.702 --> 00:18:10.913
Inspiration.

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:17.176
By inspiring ourselves

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:19.366
we inspire others.

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.149
I will never forget this music,

00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:23.666
and I hope now neither will you.

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:26.398
Please take this music with you home,

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.904
and start gluing feathers to your arms

00:18:29.904 --> 00:18:32.222
and take off and fly,

00:18:32.222 --> 00:18:38.230
and look at the world from a different perspective.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.675
And when you see mountains,

00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:43.468
remember mountains can be moved.

00:18:43.468 --> 00:18:51.600
(Applause)

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.602
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:54.618 --> 00:18:58.290
Thank you.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.612
(Applause)
