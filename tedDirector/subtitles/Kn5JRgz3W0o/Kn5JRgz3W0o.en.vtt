00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:16.829
In the northwest corner
of the United States,

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:19.703
right up near the Canadian border,

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:23.529
there's a little town
called Libby, Montana,

00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:28.014
and it's surrounded
by pine trees and lakes

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:32.737
and just amazing wildlife

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:38.075
and these enormous trees
that scream up into the sky.

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:41.594
And in there is a little town
called Libby,

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:45.939
which I visited, which feels
kind of lonely,

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.336
a little isolated.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.988
And in Libby, Montana,
there's a rather unusual woman

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:54.015
named Gayla Benefield.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.378
She always felt a little bit
of an outsider,

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:58.942
although she's been there
almost all her life,

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.390
a woman of Russian extraction.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.129
She told me when she went to school,

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:04.902
she was the only girl who ever chose

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:08.150
to do mechanical drawing.

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:12.048
Later in life, she got
a job going house to house

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.158
reading utility meters -- gas
meters, electricity meters.

00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:19.158
And she was doing the work
in the middle of the day,

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:22.585
and one thing particularly
caught her notice, which was,

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.691
in the middle of the day
she met a lot of men

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:31.081
who were at home, middle
aged, late middle aged,

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:36.524
and a lot of them seemed
to be on oxygen tanks.

00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:39.287
It struck her as strange.

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:42.898
Then, a few years later, her
father died at the age of 59,

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:46.828
five days before he was due
to receive his pension.

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:47.916
He'd been a miner.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.358
She thought he must just have
been worn out by the work.

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:57.090
But then a few years
later, her mother died,

00:01:57.114 --> 00:02:00.107
and that seemed stranger still,

00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.941
because her mother came
from a long line of people

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:06.802
who just seemed to live forever.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:10.371
In fact, Gayla's uncle
is still alive to this day,

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.545
and learning how to waltz.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.980
It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.434
should die so young.

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:22.678
It was an anomaly, and she kept
puzzling over anomalies.

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:24.734
And as she did, other ones came to mind.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:26.462
She remembered, for example,

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:29.561
when her mother had broken a leg
and went into the hospital,

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:31.336
and she had a lot of x-rays,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.291
and two of them were leg
x-rays, which made sense,

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:39.101
but six of them were chest
x-rays, which didn't.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.083
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:44.459
of her life and her parents' life,

00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:48.460
trying to understand what she was seeing.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.171
She thought about her town.

00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:53.159
The town had a vermiculite mine in it.

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:55.992
Vermiculite was used
for soil conditioners,

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:59.272
to make plants grow faster and better.

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:02.330
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,

00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.977
huge amounts of it put under the roof

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.828
to keep houses warm
during the long Montana winters.

00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:11.195
Vermiculite was in the playground.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.648
It was in the football ground.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.081
It was in the skating rink.

00:03:15.105 --> 00:03:18.910
What she didn't learn until she started
working this problem

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:25.995
is vermiculite is a very
toxic form of asbestos.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.774
When she figured out the puzzle,

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:30.680
she started telling everyone she could

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:33.347
what had happened, what had
been done to her parents

00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.417
and to the people
that she saw on oxygen tanks

00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.578
at home in the afternoons.

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:40.979
But she was really amazed.

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:44.051
She thought, when everybody knows,
they'll want to do something,

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:46.273
but actually nobody wanted to know.

00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:48.388
In fact, she became so annoying

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:50.825
as she kept insisting
on telling this story

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.040
to her neighbors, to her friends,
to other people in the community,

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:56.160
that eventually a bunch
of them got together

00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:57.668
and they made a bumper sticker,

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.936
which they proudly displayed
on their cars, which said,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.082
"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:08.622
and no, I don't have asbestosis."

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.002
But Gayla didn't stop.
She kept doing research.

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:15.193
The advent of the Internet
definitely helped her.

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.213
She talked to anybody she could.

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:20.488
She argued and argued,
and finally she struck lucky

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:22.688
when a researcher came through town

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:25.122
studying the history of mines in the area,

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:28.264
and she told him her story,
and at first, of course,

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:30.535
like everyone, he didn't believe her,

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.178
but he went back to Seattle
and he did his own research

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:37.338
and he realized that she was right.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:41.400
So now she had an ally.

00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:43.990
Nevertheless, people still
didn't want to know.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:47.714
They said things like, "Well,
if it were really dangerous,

00:04:47.738 --> 00:04:50.747
someone would have told us."

00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.769
"If that's really why everyone was dying,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:58.345
the doctors would have told us."

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.721
Some of the guys used
to very heavy jobs said,

00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:03.532
"I don't want to be a victim.

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:05.550
I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,

00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:12.483
every industry has its accidents."

00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:16.289
But still Gayla went on,
and finally she succeeded

00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:18.901
in getting a federal
agency to come to town

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:23.189
and to screen the inhabitants
of the town --

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:27.917
15,000 people -- and what they discovered

00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.336
was that the town had a mortality rate

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.394
80 times higher than anywhere
in the United States.

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:41.410
That was in 2002, and even at that moment,

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:45.100
no one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,

00:05:45.124 --> 00:05:49.415
look in the playground where
your grandchildren are playing.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.119
It's lined with vermiculite."

00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:57.186
This wasn't ignorance.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.955
It was willful blindness.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.434
Willful blindness is a legal
concept which means,

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:06.411
if there's information that you
could know and you should know

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.838
but you somehow manage not to know,

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:12.584
the law deems that you're willfully blind.

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:16.359
You have chosen not to know.

00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:20.758
There's a lot of willful
blindness around these days.

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:23.609
You can see willful blindness in banks,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.666
when thousands of people
sold mortgages to people

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.374
who couldn't afford them.

00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:30.032
You could see them in banks

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.196
when interest rates were manipulated

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.608
and everyone around knew
what was going on,

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:37.782
but everyone studiously ignored it.

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:41.206
You can see willful blindness
in the Catholic Church,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.827
where decades of child abuse went ignored.

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:48.122
You could see willful blindness

00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:52.633
in the run-up to the Iraq War.

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:56.272
Willful blindness exists
on epic scales like those,

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:59.167
and it also exists on very small scales,

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:03.095
in people's families,
in people's homes and communities,

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:08.573
and particularly in organizations
and institutions.

00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:12.815
Companies that have been studied
for willful blindness

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.098
can be asked questions like,

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:17.924
"Are there issues at work

00:07:17.948 --> 00:07:21.354
that people are afraid to raise?"

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:23.569
And when academics have
done studies like this

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.866
of corporations in the United States,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.114
what they find is 85
percent of people say yes.

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:34.122
Eighty-five percent of people
know there's a problem,

00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:36.197
but they won't say anything.

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:39.584
And when I duplicated
the research in Europe,

00:07:39.608 --> 00:07:42.246
asking all the same questions,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.336
I found exactly the same number.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.387
Eighty-five percent.
That's a lot of silence.

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.469
It's a lot of blindness.

00:07:51.493 --> 00:07:55.113
And what's really interesting is that when
I go to companies in Switzerland,

00:07:55.137 --> 00:07:58.531
they tell me, "This
is a uniquely Swiss problem."

00:07:58.555 --> 00:08:02.731
And when I go to Germany, they say,
"Oh yes, this is the German disease."

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.041
And when I go to companies
in England, they say,

00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:08.780
"Oh, yeah, the British
are really bad at this."

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:13.450
And the truth is, this is a human problem.

00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:19.815
We're all, under certain
circumstances, willfully blind.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:22.363
What the research shows
is that some people are blind

00:08:22.387 --> 00:08:25.968
out of fear. They're
afraid of retaliation.

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:29.343
And some people are blind
because they think, well,

00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:31.761
seeing anything is just futile.

00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:33.617
Nothing's ever going to change.

00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:36.431
If we make a protest, if we protest
against the Iraq War,

00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:38.201
nothing changes, so why bother?

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:42.743
Better not to see this stuff at all.

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:45.741
And the recurrent theme
that I encounter all the time

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:48.221
is people say, "Well, you know,

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:51.721
the people who do see,
they're whistleblowers,

00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:54.345
and we all know what happens to them."

00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:58.394
So there's this profound
mythology around whistleblowers

00:08:58.418 --> 00:09:02.707
which says, first of all,
they're all crazy.

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.020
But what I've found going around the world

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.207
and talking to whistleblowers
is, actually,

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:12.962
they're very loyal and quite
often very conservative people.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:16.867
They're hugely dedicated
to the institutions that they work for,

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.174
and the reason that they speak up,

00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:22.056
the reason they insist on seeing,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.553
is because they care so
much about the institution

00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:29.139
and want to keep it healthy.

00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:31.302
And the other thing that people often say

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:34.530
about whistleblowers is,
"Well, there's no point,

00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:37.099
because you see what happens to them.

00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:38.413
They are crushed.

00:09:38.437 --> 00:09:42.155
Nobody would want to go
through something like that."

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:45.482
And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,

00:09:45.506 --> 00:09:50.642
the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:53.027
I think of Joe Darby.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:56.479
We all remember the photographs
of Abu Ghraib,

00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:00.201
which so shocked the world
and showed the kind of war

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.865
that was being fought in Iraq.

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:05.876
But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.372
the very obedient, good soldier

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:14.135
who found those photographs
and handed them in.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:17.853
And he said, "You know,
I'm not the kind of guy

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:22.079
to rat people out, but some things
just cross the line.

00:10:22.103 --> 00:10:24.175
Ignorance is bliss, they say,

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:27.903
but you can't put
up with things like this."

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.938
I talked to Steve Bolsin,
a British doctor,

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:35.244
who fought for five years
to draw attention

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:40.267
to a dangerous surgeon
who was killing babies.

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.339
And I asked him why
he did it, and he said,

00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:46.425
"Well, it was really my daughter
who prompted me to do it.

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:48.689
She came up to me one night,
and she just said,

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:52.118
'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"

00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:54.869
Or I think of Cynthia Thomas,

00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:58.854
a really loyal army
daughter and army wife,

00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:01.806
who, as she saw her friends and relations

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.108
coming back from the Iraq
War, was so shocked

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.996
by their mental condition

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.027
and the refusal of the military
to recognize and acknowledge

00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:14.691
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:20.299
that she set up a cafe
in the middle of a military town

00:11:20.323 --> 00:11:25.929
to give them legal, psychological
and medical assistance.

00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:28.869
And she said to me, she said,
"You know, Margaret,

00:11:28.893 --> 00:11:32.662
I always used to say I didn't
know what I wanted to be

00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:34.950
when I grow up.

00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:39.443
But I've found myself in this cause,

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:44.460
and I'll never be the same."

00:11:44.484 --> 00:11:47.756
We all enjoy so many freedoms today,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.712
hard-won freedoms:

00:11:49.736 --> 00:11:53.180
the freedom to write and publish
without fear of censorship,

00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:56.955
a freedom that wasn't here
the last time I came to Hungary;

00:11:56.979 --> 00:11:59.441
a freedom to vote,
which women in particular

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:01.920
had to fight so hard for;

00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:04.802
the freedom for people of different
ethnicities and cultures

00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:09.758
and sexual orientation to live
the way that they want.

00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:14.592
But freedom doesn't exist
if you don't use it,

00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:16.933
and what whistleblowers do,

00:12:16.957 --> 00:12:19.500
and what people like Gayla Benefield do

00:12:19.524 --> 00:12:24.106
is they use the freedom that they have.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.588
And what they're very
prepared to do is recognize

00:12:27.612 --> 00:12:30.218
that yes, this is going to be an argument,

00:12:30.242 --> 00:12:33.210
and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows

00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:37.199
with my neighbors
and my colleagues and my friends,

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:40.421
but I'm going to become
very good at this conflict.

00:12:40.445 --> 00:12:42.764
I'm going to take on the naysayers,

00:12:42.788 --> 00:12:47.684
because they'll make my argument
better and stronger.

00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:50.116
I can collaborate with my opponents

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.598
to become better at what I do.

00:12:54.622 --> 00:12:57.420
These are people of immense persistence,

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:02.323
incredible patience,
and an absolute determination

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:07.794
not to be blind and not to be silent.

00:13:07.818 --> 00:13:10.987
When I went to Libby, Montana,

00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:14.348
I visited the asbestosis clinic

00:13:14.372 --> 00:13:18.269
that Gayla Benefield brought into being,

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:21.149
a place where at first some of the people

00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:24.391
who wanted help and needed
medical attention

00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:27.021
went in the back door

00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:29.506
because they didn't want to acknowledge

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.951
that she'd been right.

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:35.124
I sat in a diner, and I watched

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:39.152
as trucks drove up and down the highway,

00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:43.406
carting away the earth out of gardens

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:50.318
and replacing it with fresh,
uncontaminated soil.

00:13:50.342 --> 00:13:52.578
I took my 12-year-old daughter with me,

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:55.965
because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.

00:13:55.989 --> 00:13:58.881
And she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:01.066
I said, "She's not a movie star,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.353
and she's not a celebrity,
and she's not an expert,

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:08.091
and Gayla's the first person who'd say

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:11.035
she's not a saint.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.175
The really important thing about Gayla

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:16.842
is she is ordinary.

00:14:16.866 --> 00:14:21.668
She's like you, and she's like me.

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:27.631
She had freedom,
and she was ready to use it."

00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:29.130
Thank you very much.

00:14:29.154 --> 00:14:33.878
(Applause)
