00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.858
For much of the past century,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.690
architecture was under the spell
of a famous doctrine.

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:21.991
"Form follows function" had become
modernity's ambitious manifesto

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.268
and detrimental straitjacket,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:27.261
as it liberated architecture
from the decorative,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:31.186
but condemned it to utilitarian rigor
and restrained purpose.

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:35.124
Of course, architecture is about function,

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:38.815
but I want to remember a rewriting
of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.552
and I want to propose
a completely different quality.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.113
If form follows fiction,

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:49.739
we could think of architecture
and buildings as a space of stories --

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:52.243
stories of the people that live there,

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.622
of the people that work
in these buildings.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:59.103
And we could start to imagine
the experiences our buildings create.

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:02.568
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:06.170
not as the implausible but as the real,

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:08.192
as the reality of what architecture means

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:10.564
for the people that live
in it and with it.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.265
Our buildings are prototypes,
ideas for how the space of living

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.617
or how the space of working
could be different,

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:22.229
and what a space of culture
or a space of media could look like today.

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:25.326
Our buildings are real;
they're being built.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.209
They're an explicit engagement
in physical reality

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.361
and conceptual possibility.

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:35.767
I think of our architecture
as organizational structures.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.904
At their core is indeed
structural thinking, like a system:

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:43.079
How can we arrange things
in both a functional

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.868
and experiential way?

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:48.856
How can we create structures
that generate a series

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.299
of relationships and narratives?

00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:53.263
And how can fictive stories

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.101
of the inhabitants and users
of our buildings

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.077
script the architecture,

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.468
while the architecture scripts
those stories at the same time?

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:04.413
And here comes the second term into play,

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:06.675
what I call "narrative hybrids" --

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:09.444
structures of multiple
simultaneous stories

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:12.198
that unfold throughout
the buildings we create.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:17.566
So we could think of architecture
as complex systems of relationships,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.406
both in a programmatic and functional way

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:25.401
and in an experiential
and emotive or social way.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.934
This is the headquarters
for China's national broadcaster,

00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.099
which I designed together
with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:38.021
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002,
the city planners showed us this image:

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.212
a forest of several hundred skyscrapers

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:42.307
to emerge in the central
business district,

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.952
except at that time,
only a handful of them existed.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.652
So we had to design in a context
that we knew almost nothing about,

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.771
except one thing:
it would all be about verticality.

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:57.145
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --
it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.585
the top always the best,
the bottom the worst,

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.772
and the taller you are,
the better, so it seems.

00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:05.170
And we wanted to ask ourselves,

00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:07.987
could a building be about
a completely different quality?

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:11.964
Could it undo this hierarchy,
and could it be about a system

00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:15.212
that is more about collaboration,
rather than isolation?

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:18.290
So we took this needle
and bent it back into itself,

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:21.167
into a loop of interconnected activities.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:25.145
Our idea was to bring all aspects
of television-making

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.156
into one single structure: news,
program production, broadcasting,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.402
research and training, administration --

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:35.094
all into a circuit
of interconnected activities

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:39.031
where people would meet in a process
of exchange and collaboration.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.777
I still very much like this image.

00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.924
It reminds one of biology classes,
if you remember the human body

00:03:44.948 --> 00:03:47.852
with all its organs
and circulatory systems, like at school.

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:51.873
And suddenly you think of architecture
no longer as built substance,

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.999
but as an organism, as a life form.

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:56.783
And as you start to dissect this organism,

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:01.536
you can identify a series
of primary technical clusters --

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.254
program production,
broadcasting center and news.

00:04:04.857 --> 00:04:08.337
Those are tightly intertwined
with social clusters:

00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:11.425
meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.533
informal spaces for people
to meet and exchange.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.498
So the organizational structure
of this building was a hybrid

00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:21.968
between the technical and the social,

00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:23.826
the human and the performative.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.973
And of course, we used the loop
of the building as a circulatory system,

00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:31.906
to thread everything together
and to allow both visitors and staff

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.515
to experience all these different
functions in a great unity.

00:04:37.118 --> 00:04:40.178
With 473,000 square meters,

00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:43.213
it is one of the largest buildings
ever built in the world.

00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:45.905
It has a population of over 10,000 people,

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:49.515
and of course, this is a scale
that exceeds the comprehension

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.299
of many things and the scale
of typical architecture.

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:53.951
So we stopped work for a while

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:58.280
and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks
and glued them onto a model,

00:04:58.304 --> 00:05:02.327
just simply to confront ourselves
with what that quantity actually meant.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.871
But of course, it's not a number,

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:09.504
it is the people, it is a community
that inhabits the building,

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:13.981
and in order to both comprehend
this, but also script this architecture,

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.251
we identified five characters,
hypothetical characters,

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.844
and we followed them throughout their day
in a life in this building,

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:24.751
thought of where they would meet,
what they would experience.

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.914
So it was a way to script and design
the building, but of course,

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:29.975
also to communicate its experiences.

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.287
This was part of an exhibition
with the Museum of Modern Art

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.619
in both New York and Beijing.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:39.064
This is the main broadcast control room,

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.906
a technical installation so large,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.262
it can broadcast over 200
channels simultaneously.

00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:49.063
And this is how the building
stands in Beijing today.

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:53.095
Its first broadcast live
was the London Olympics 2012,

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.174
after it had been completed
from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:02.061
And you can see at the very tip
of this 75-meter cantilever,

00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:03.639
those three little circles.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:07.164
And they're indeed part of a public loop
that goes through the building.

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:09.740
They're a piece of glass
that you can stand on

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:13.867
and watch the city pass by
below you in slow motion.

00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:18.774
The building has become
part of everyday life in Beijing.

00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:20.289
It is there.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.401
It has also become a very popular backdrop

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.910
for wedding photography.

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.796
(Laughter)

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.595
But its most important moment
is maybe sill this one.

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.673
"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"

00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:40.547
a magazine that broadcasts what
is happening in town during the week,

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:45.534
and suddenly you see the building
portrayed no longer as physical matter,

00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:47.073
but actually as an urban actor,

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:51.786
as part of a series of personas
that define the life of the city.

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:57.897
So architecture suddenly
assumes the quality of a player,

00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:01.844
of something that writes stories
and performs stories.

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:06.931
And I think that could be one
of its primary meanings

00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:08.202
that we believe in.

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:10.837
But of course, there's another
story to this building.

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:13.790
It is the story of the people
that made it --

00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:16.632
400 engineers and architects
that I was guiding

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:19.247
over almost a decade of collaborative work

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:22.238
that we spent together
in scripting this building,

00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:24.168
in imagining its reality

00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:27.483
and ultimately getting it built in China.

00:07:29.737 --> 00:07:34.093
This is a residential development
in Singapore, large scale.

00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:38.771
If we look at Singapore like most of Asia
and more and more of the world,

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:42.342
of course, it is dominated by the tower,

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:46.887
a typology that indeed creates
more isolation than connectedness,

00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.122
and I wanted to ask, how
could we think about living,

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:53.971
not only in terms of the privacy
and individuality of ourselves

00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:55.431
and our apartment,

00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:58.091
but in an idea of a collective?

00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:01.514
How could we think about creating
a communal environment

00:08:01.538 --> 00:08:05.426
in which sharing things was as great
as having your own?

00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:11.360
The typical answer to the question --
we had to design 1,040 apartments --

00:08:11.384 --> 00:08:12.741
would have looked like this:

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:15.511
24-story height limit given
by the planning authorities,

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:19.509
12 towers with nothing
but residual in between --

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.446
a very tight system that,
although the tower isolates you,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.977
it doesn't even give you privacy,
because you're so close to the next one,

00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.291
that it is very questionable
what the qualities of this would be.

00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:34.782
So I proposed to topple the towers,
throw the vertical into the horizontal

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.596
and stack them up,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.167
and what looks a bit random from the side,

00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:41.985
if you look from the viewpoint
of the helicopter,

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:46.738
you can see its organizational structure
is actually a hexagonal grid,

00:08:46.762 --> 00:08:50.499
in which these horizontal
building blocks are stacked up

00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:55.592
to create huge outdoor courtyards --
central spaces for the community,

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:58.972
programmed with a variety
of amenities and functions.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.087
And you see that these courtyards
are not hermetically sealed spaces.

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:05.603
They're open, permeable;
they're interconnected.

00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:07.851
We called the project "The Interlace,"

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:10.849
thinking that we interlace
and interconnect

00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:13.788
the human beings and the spaces alike.

00:09:14.502 --> 00:09:17.393
And the detailed quality
of everything we designed

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:21.249
was about animating the space
and giving the space to the inhabitants.

00:09:21.273 --> 00:09:22.670
And, in fact, it was a system

00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:26.162
where we would layer
primarily communal spaces,

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:30.146
stacked to more and more
individual and private spaces.

00:09:30.662 --> 00:09:32.505
So we would open up a spectrum

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:35.719
between the collective and the individual.

00:09:36.203 --> 00:09:37.354
A little piece of math:

00:09:37.378 --> 00:09:39.929
if we count all the green
that we left on the ground,

00:09:39.953 --> 00:09:42.038
minus the footprint of the buildings,

00:09:42.062 --> 00:09:45.489
and we would add back
the green of all the terraces,

00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:47.567
we have 112 percent green space,

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:50.074
so more nature than not
having built a building.

00:09:50.463 --> 00:09:54.465
And of course this little piece of math
shows you that we are multiplying

00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.346
the space available
to those who live there.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.014
This is, in fact, the 13th floor
of one of these terraces.

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:05.657
So you see new datum planes,
new grounds planes for social activity.

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:09.730
We paid a lot of attention
to sustainability.

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:13.791
In the tropics, the sun is the most
important thing to pay attention to,

00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:16.877
and, in fact, it is seeking
protection from the sun.

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:20.038
We first proved that all apartments
would have sufficient daylight

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:21.235
through the year.

00:10:21.648 --> 00:10:24.309
We then went on to optimize
the glazing of the facades

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.902
to minimize the energy
consumption of the building.

00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.396
But most importantly, we could prove
that through the geometry

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.996
of the building design,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.382
the building itself would provide
sufficient shading to the courtyards

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:39.408
so that those would be usable
throughout the entire year.

00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:42.910
We further placed water bodies
along the prevailing wind corridors,

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.654
so that evaporative cooling
would create microclimates

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:50.163
that, again, would enhance
the quality of those spaces

00:10:50.187 --> 00:10:52.598
available for the inhabitants.

00:10:53.773 --> 00:10:57.519
And it was the idea of creating
this variety of choices,

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:01.616
of freedom to think
where you would want to be,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.544
where you would want to escape, maybe,

00:11:03.568 --> 00:11:07.386
within the own complexity
of the complex in which you live.

00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:11.076
But coming from Asia to Europe:

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.956
a building for a German
media company based in Berlin,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.400
transitioning from the traditional
print media to the digital media.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.694
And its CEO asked a few
very pertinent questions:

00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:25.751
Why would anyone today
still want to go to the office,

00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:27.964
because you can actually work anywhere?

00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:31.861
And how could a digital identity
of a company be embodied

00:11:31.885 --> 00:11:33.036
in a building?

00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:37.970
We created not only an object,
but at the center of this object

00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:39.589
we created a giant space,

00:11:39.613 --> 00:11:43.287
and this space was about
the experience of a collective,

00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:46.178
the experience of collaboration
and of togetherness.

00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:50.626
Communication, interaction
as the center of a space

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.189
that in itself would float,

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.325
like what we call the collaborative cloud,

00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:56.857
in the middle of the building,

00:11:56.881 --> 00:12:00.269
surrounded by an envelope
of standard modular offices.

00:12:00.944 --> 00:12:04.094
So with only a few steps
from your quiet work desk,

00:12:04.118 --> 00:12:07.845
you could participate
in the giant collective experience

00:12:07.869 --> 00:12:09.498
of the central space.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:15.738
Finally, we come to London,
a project commissioned

00:12:15.762 --> 00:12:18.340
by the London Legacy
Development Corporation

00:12:18.364 --> 00:12:19.793
of the Mayor of London.

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:22.497
We were asked to undertake a study

00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:25.313
and investigate the potential of a site

00:12:25.337 --> 00:12:27.808
out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.

00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:31.813
In the 19th century, Prince Albert
had created Albertopolis.

00:12:32.513 --> 00:12:36.251
And Boris Johnson thought
of creating Olympicopolis.

00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.483
The idea was to bring together
some of Britain's greatest institutions,

00:12:41.507 --> 00:12:45.367
some international ones,
and to create a new system of synergies.

00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:50.327
Prince Albert, as yet, created
Albertopolis in the 19th century,

00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:52.814
thought of showcasing
all achievements of mankind,

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.638
bringing arts and science closer together.

00:12:56.082 --> 00:13:00.756
And he built Exhibition Road,
a linear sequence of those institutions.

00:13:01.836 --> 00:13:05.527
But of course, today's society
has moved on from there.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.507
We no longer live in a world

00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:10.211
in which everything
is as clearly delineated

00:13:10.235 --> 00:13:11.737
or separated from each other.

00:13:11.761 --> 00:13:15.150
We live in a world in which
boundaries start to blur

00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:16.642
between the different domains,

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:20.656
and in which collaboration and interaction
becomes far more important

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.464
than keeping separations.

00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:26.427
So we wanted to think
of a giant culture machine,

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:31.228
a building that would orchestrate
and animate the various domains,

00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:34.306
but allow them to interact
and collaborate.

00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:37.316
At the base of it is a very simple module,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.491
a ring module.

00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:42.158
It can function as a double-loaded
corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.

00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:43.333
It can be glazed over

00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:46.230
and turned into a giant
exhibitional performance space.

00:13:46.254 --> 00:13:48.379
These modules were stacked together

00:13:48.403 --> 00:13:52.165
with the idea that almost any
function could, over time,

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:53.926
occupy any of these modules.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.066
So institutions could shrink or contract,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.811
as, of course, the future of culture
is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:05.688
This is how the building sits,
adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:07.663
opposite the Olympic Stadium.

00:14:08.608 --> 00:14:10.941
And you can see how
its cantilevering volumes

00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:13.755
project out and engage the public space

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:17.480
and how its courtyards
animate the public inside.

00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:22.541
The idea was to create a complex system

00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:27.453
in which institutional entities
could maintain their own identity,

00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:30.410
in which they would not
be subsumed in a singular volume.

00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:33.600
Here's a scale comparison
to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

00:14:33.624 --> 00:14:36.989
It both shows the enormous scale
and potential of the project,

00:14:37.013 --> 00:14:38.300
but also the difference:

00:14:38.324 --> 00:14:42.499
here, it is a multiplicity
of a heterogeneous structure,

00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:45.034
in which different entities can interact

00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:47.517
without losing their own identity.

00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:52.345
And it was this thought: to create
an organizational structure

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:55.202
that would allow for multiple
narratives to be scripted --

00:14:55.226 --> 00:15:00.680
for those in the educational parts
that create and think culture;

00:15:00.704 --> 00:15:04.210
for those that present
the visual arts, the dance;

00:15:04.234 --> 00:15:07.043
and for the public to be
admitted into all of this

00:15:07.067 --> 00:15:09.713
with a series of possible trajectories,

00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:12.469
to script their own reading
of these narratives

00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.126
and their own experience.

00:15:16.475 --> 00:15:19.881
And I want to end on a project
that is very small,

00:15:19.905 --> 00:15:21.158
in a way, very different:

00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:23.944
a floating cinema
in the ocean of Thailand.

00:15:23.968 --> 00:15:27.504
Friends of mine had founded
a film festival,

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:28.718
and I thought,

00:15:29.226 --> 00:15:32.505
if we think of the stories
and narratives of movies,

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:36.072
we should also think of the narratives
of the people that watch them.

00:15:36.096 --> 00:15:39.381
So I designed a small
modular floating platform,

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.679
based on the techniques
of local fishermen,

00:15:41.703 --> 00:15:43.790
how they built their lobster
and fish farms.

00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:46.193
We collaborated with the local community

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:49.949
and built, out of recycled
materials of their own,

00:15:49.973 --> 00:15:52.095
this fantastical floating platform

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.040
that gently moved in the ocean

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:56.948
as we watched films
from the British film archive,

00:15:56.972 --> 00:15:59.638
[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.

00:15:59.987 --> 00:16:03.044
The most primordial
experiences of the audience

00:16:03.068 --> 00:16:06.133
merged with the stories of the movies.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.650
So I believe that architecture exceeds
the domain of physical matter,

00:16:12.674 --> 00:16:14.134
of the built environment,

00:16:14.158 --> 00:16:17.347
but is really about how
we want to live our lives,

00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:20.433
how we script our own stories
and those of others.

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:22.036
Thank you.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.473
(Applause)
