00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.770
Whenever I get to travel for work,

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.302
I try to find out where my
drinking water comes from,

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:18.993
and where my poop and pee go.

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:20.861
(Laughter)

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.912
This has earned me the nickname
"The Poo Princess" in my family,

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:27.913
and it's ruined many family vacations,
because this is not normal.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:33.873
But thinking about where it all goes
is the first step in activating

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:36.712
what are actually superpowers
in our poop and pee.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.812
(Laughter)

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:38.990
Yeah.

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:40.172
And if we use them well,

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:42.347
we can live healthier
and more beautifully.

00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:45.992
Check out this landscape
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:49.913
Just notice what kinds of words
and feelings come to mind.

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:55.271
This landscape was watered
with treated sewage water.

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:57.652
Does that change anything for you?

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.716
I imagine it might.

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:03.482
And that's OK.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.094
How we feel about this

00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:10.565
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:14.169
And I want to explain how it works,

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.638
but what words do I use?

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:21.123
I mean, I can use profane words
like "shit" and "piss,"

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.427
and then my grandma won't watch the video.

00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:26.831
Or I can use childish words
like "poo" and "pee." Eh.

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:31.970
Or I can use scientific words
like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:33.261
I'll use a mix.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.625
(Laughter)

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.654
It's all I got. (Laughs)

00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:39.171
So, in this suburb,

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:43.120
the poo and the pee and the wash water
are going to this treatment plant

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:45.261
right in the middle of the community.

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:47.946
It looks more like a park
than a treatment plant.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.356
The poo at the very bottom
of all those layers of gravel --

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.896
not touching anyone --

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.661
is providing solid food
for those marsh plants.

00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:59.519
And the clean, clear water
that comes out the other end

00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:03.304
is traveling underground
to water each person's yard.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:05.023
So even though they're in a desert,

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:06.904
they get their own personal oasis.

00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:11.175
This approach is called
Integrated Water Management,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.579
or holistic or closed-loop.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.588
Whatever you want to call it,

00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:19.247
it's in conflict with the status quo
of how we think about sanitation,

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:22.599
which is contain, treat, push it away.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.585
But in this approach,
we're doing one step better.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.971
We're designing for reuse
from the very beginning,

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.563
because everything does get reused,

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.741
only now we're planning for it.

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:35.397
And often, that makes for
really beautiful spaces.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:41.107
But the most important thing
about this system

00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:43.130
isn't the technicals of how it works.

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:45.440
It's how you feel about it.

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.995
Do you want this in your yard?

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:49.705
Why not?

00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:53.087
I got really curious about this question.

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.451
Why don't we see more
innovation in sanitation?

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.974
Why isn't that kind of thing
the new normal?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.790
And I care so much about this question,

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.973
that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:05.901
We want to accelerate adoption

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.697
of sustainable building
and development practices.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.465
We want more innovation.

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:15.351
But a lot of times,
whole categories of innovation --

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:18.173
ones that can help us
live more beautifully --

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.568
turn out to be illegal.

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:24.180
Today's regulations and codes
were written under the assumption

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.218
that best practices
would remain best practices,

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.498
with incremental updates forever and ever.

00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:33.736
But innovation isn't always incremental.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:37.766
It turns out, how we feel
about any particular new technique

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.639
gets into everything we do:

00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:40.933
how we talk about it,

00:03:40.957 --> 00:03:42.783
how we encourage people to study,

00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:44.730
our jokes, our codes ...

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:47.701
And it ultimately determines
how innovative we can be.

00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:52.510
So, that's the first reason
we don't innovate in sanitation.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.392
We're kind of uncomfortable
talking about sanitation,

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.118
that's why I've gotten called
"The Poo Princess" so much.

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:00.833
The second reason is:

00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:03.387
we think the problem is solved
here in the US.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.063
But not so.

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:10.129
Here in the US we still get sick
from drinking shit in our sewage water.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.844
Seven million people get sick every year,

00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:14.639
900 die annually.

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:17.853
And we're not taking a holistic
approach to making it better.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.782
So we're not solving it.

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.424
Where I live in Portland, Oregon,

00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:26.251
I can't take Echo for a swim
during the rainy season,

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:29.383
because we dump raw sewage
sometimes into our river.

00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:33.130
Our rainwater and our sewage
go to the same treatment plant.

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:36.896
Too much rain overflows into the river.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.545
And Portland is not alone here.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.659
Forty percent of municipalities self-report

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:46.512
dumping raw or partially treated
sewage into our waterways.

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:50.600
The other bummer going on here
with our status quo

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:55.181
is that half of all of your poop and pee
is going to fertilize farmland.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.185
The other half is being incinerated

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:59.423
or land-filled.

00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:00.955
And that's a bummer to me,

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.941
because there are amazing nutrients
in your daily doody.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:06.131
It is comparable to pig manure;

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:08.432
we're omnivores, they're omnivores.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.623
Think of your poo and pee
as a health smoothie for a tree.

00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:16.470
(Laughter)

00:05:17.357 --> 00:05:19.166
The other bummer going on here

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.205
is that we're quickly moving
all the drugs we take into our waterways.

00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:28.202
The average wastewater treatment plant
can remove maybe half of the drugs

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:29.439
that come in.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.540
The other half goes
right out the other side.

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:36.020
Consider what a cocktail
of pharmaceuticals --

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.065
hormones, steroids, Vicodin --

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.872
does to a fish,

00:05:39.896 --> 00:05:41.118
to a dog,

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:42.342
to a child.

00:05:44.322 --> 00:05:47.802
But this isn't just some problem
that we need to contain.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:50.613
If we flip this around,
we can create a resource

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:53.313
that can solve so many
of our other problems.

00:05:53.758 --> 00:05:56.138
And I want to get you
comfortable with this idea,

00:05:56.162 --> 00:06:00.311
so imagine the things I'm going
to show you, these technologies,

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:02.324
and this attitude that says,

00:06:02.348 --> 00:06:03.696
"We're going to reuse this.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.934
Let's design to make it beautiful" --

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.491
as advanced potty training.

00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:08.538
(Laughter)

00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:10.288
I think you're ready for it.

00:06:10.312 --> 00:06:13.684
I think we as a culture are ready
for advanced potty training.

00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:17.006
And there are three great
reasons to enroll today.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.310
Number one:

00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:20.992
we can fertilize our food.

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:23.528
Each one of us is pooping
and peeing something

00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:26.291
that could fertilize half
or maybe all of our food,

00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:27.758
depending on our diet.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.335
That dark brown poo in the toilet
is dark brown because of what?

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.747
Dead stuff, bacteria.

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.400
That's carbon.

00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:37.730
And carbon, if we're getting
that into the soil,

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:40.785
is going to bind to the other minerals
and nutrients in there.

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:43.112
Boom! Healthier food.

00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:45.323
Voilà! Healthier people.

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:49.866
Chemical fertilizers by definition
don't have carbon in them.

00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:56.584
Imagine if we could move our animal manure
and our human manure to our soil,

00:06:56.608 --> 00:07:00.414
we might not need to rely
on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:02.409
mine minerals from far away.

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:05.863
Imagine how much energy we could save.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.290
Now, some of us are concerned

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:14.255
about industrial pollutants
contaminating this reuse cycle.

00:07:15.322 --> 00:07:16.975
That can be addressed.

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:22.379
But we need to separate our discomfort
about talking about poo and pee

00:07:22.403 --> 00:07:26.767
so we can calmly talk
about how we want to reuse it

00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:29.432
and what things we don't want to reuse.

00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:30.612
And get this:

00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:34.393
if we change our approach to sanitation,

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:37.072
we can start to slow down climate change.

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:40.136
Remember that carbon in the poop?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.850
If we can get that into our soil bank,

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:47.687
it's going to start to absorb
carbon dioxide that we put into the air.

00:07:48.154 --> 00:07:50.464
And that could help
slow down global warming.

00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:53.904
I want to show you some brave souls

00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:58.234
who've had the courage to embrace
this advanced potty training approach.

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:00.719
So those folks in New Mexico --

00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:02.123
why did they do it?

00:08:02.735 --> 00:08:05.414
'Cause they're in a desert?
'Cause they save money? Yeah.

00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:08.833
But more importantly,
they felt comfortable

00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:13.060
seeing what was going
down the toilet as a resource.

00:08:13.642 --> 00:08:15.738
Here's an average house
in Portland, Oregon.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:18.699
This house is special
because they have a composting toilet

00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:22.840
turning all their poo and pee,
over time, into a soil amendment.

00:08:23.547 --> 00:08:26.441
Their wash water, their shower water,
is going underground

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:28.353
to a series of mulch basins,

00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:31.495
and then watering that orchard downhill.

00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:34.247
When they went to get this permitted,

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:36.564
it wasn't allowed in Oregon.

00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:39.728
But it was allowed
in five other states nearby.

00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:44.394
That was Recode's -- my organization's --
first code-change campaign.

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:50.620
Here's a great example where
the Integrated Water Management approach

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:52.084
was the cheapest.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:56.704
This is three high-rise residential
buildings in downtown Portland,

00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:59.308
and they're not flushing
to the sewer system.

00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:00.491
How?

00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:04.437
Well, their wash water
is getting reused to flush toilets,

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.128
cool mechanical systems,

00:09:06.152 --> 00:09:07.460
water the landscape.

00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:10.882
And then once the building
has thoroughly used everything --

00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:12.429
aka, shat in it --

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:17.075
it's treated to highest standard
right on-site by plants and bacteria,

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.544
and then infiltrated
into the groundwater right below.

00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:24.874
And all that was cheaper

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.801
than updating the surrounding
sewer infrastructure.

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:31.091
So that's the last reason
we should get really excited

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:32.607
about doing things differently:

00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:34.826
we can save a lot of money.

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:38.968
This was the first permit
of its kind in Oregon.

00:09:39.597 --> 00:09:43.758
Brave and open-minded people
sat down and felt comfortable saying,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.910
"Yeah, that shit makes sense."

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:48.402
(Laughter)

00:09:48.426 --> 00:09:49.667
"Let's do it."

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:50.692
(Applause)

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:51.867
You know?

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.040
I keep showing examples

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.222
where everyone's reusing
everything on-site.

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:57.397
Why?

00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.695
Well, when we look at our aging
infrastructure -- and it is old --

00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:02.622
and we look at the cost of updating it,

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:07.253
three-quarters of that cost is just
the pipes snaking through our city.

00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.845
So as we build anew, as we renovate,

00:10:09.869 --> 00:10:14.741
it might make more sense
to treat and reuse everything on-site.

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.070
San Francisco realized that it made sense

00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:20.768
to invest in rebates for every household

00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:23.325
to reuse their wash water
and their rainwater

00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:24.982
to water the backyard,

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:29.073
because the amount of water they would
save as a community would be so big.

00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:32.748
But why were all
these projects so innovative?

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:35.026
The money piece, yeah.

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:37.614
But more importantly,

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:40.970
they felt comfortable with this idea
of advanced potty training.

00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:46.600
Imagine if we embraced
innovation for sanitation

00:10:46.624 --> 00:10:49.922
the way we have for, say, solar power.

00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:54.120
Think about it -- solar power used
to be uncommon and unaffordable.

00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:57.697
Now it's more a part
of our web of power than ever before.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.704
And it's creating resiliency.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.964
We now have sources of power like the sun

00:11:02.988 --> 00:11:05.444
that don't vary with our earthly dramas.

00:11:06.282 --> 00:11:08.443
What's driving all that innovation?

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.376
It's us.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.423
We're talking about energy.

00:11:12.447 --> 00:11:14.818
It's cool to talk about energy.

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:18.183
Some folks are even talking
about the problems

00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:21.373
with the limited resources
where our current energy is coming from.

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:25.461
We encourage our best and brightest
to work on this issue --

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:28.677
better solar panels,
better batteries, everything.

00:11:30.099 --> 00:11:33.209
So let's talk about where
our drinking water is coming from,

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:35.824
where our poo and pee are actually going.

00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:41.284
If we can get over this discomfort
with this entire topic,

00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:44.364
we could create something
that creates our future goldmine.

00:11:45.158 --> 00:11:46.779
Every time you flush the toilet,

00:11:46.803 --> 00:11:48.422
I want you to think,

00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:50.470
"Where is my poop and pee going?

00:11:50.494 --> 00:11:52.397
Will they be gainfully employed?"

00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:53.673
(Laughter)

00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:56.875
"Or are they going to be wreaking
havoc in some waterway?"

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:58.802
If you don't know, find out.

00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:00.604
And if you don't like the answer,

00:12:00.628 --> 00:12:04.355
figure out how you can communicate
to those who can drive this change

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:08.391
that you have advanced potty training,
that you are ready for reuse.

00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:10.842
How all of you feel

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:14.167
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.350
Thank you so much.

00:12:15.374 --> 00:12:20.851
(Applause)
