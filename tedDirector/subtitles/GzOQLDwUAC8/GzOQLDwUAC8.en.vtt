00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about with happiness is, what gives happiness --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or happiness, which I equate with joy in my

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
particular area, and I think there's something very

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
something about these things where our

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you find a joyful experience. You look at those

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you'd expect. And there's something joyful about

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and do in my lecture is go a little bit further

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and see if I can violate your expectations in a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so I can make the audience here happy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
violate your expectations. First of all, I want to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
show you the particular illusion here. I want you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
first of all when it pops up on the screen to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
notice that the two holes are perpendicular to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the film here so you can get a very interesting

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
experience. I want you to see how this illusion is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
it from happening. No. It's difficult.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And we can violate your expectations in a whole

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
variety of ways about representation, about shape,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
about color and so forth and it's very primal. And

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it's an interesting question to ponder, why these

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
things -- we find these things joyful. Why would

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we find them joyful? So, here's something that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
little things like this.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:41.000
you would see. In other words, it's not a camera

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
cut. It's a perceptual trick.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
OK. We can violate your expectations about

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
shape.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We can violate your expectations on representation

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
-- what an image represents. What do you see here?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
best example of priming by experience that I know.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
If you are a child under the age of 10 who

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
experience.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Now, something like this can be used because this

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is after all talk about design, too. This was

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
provocative positions. But they got it passed, and

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
these things.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
when the Florida ballot was going around. You

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Bush; count 'em again ...

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You can violate your expectations about

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
experience. Here is an outside water fountain that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I created with some friends of mine, but you can

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
stop the water in drops and -- actually make all

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the drops levitate. This is something we're

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
building for, you know, amusement parks and that

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
kind of stuff.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Do you see the middle section moving down and the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
outer sections moving up? It's completely static.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's a static image. How many people see this

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
illusion? It's completely static.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
look at an image we see, you know, color, depth,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
texture. And you can look at this whole scene and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
got irritated when they tried to talk to the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
woman and she wouldn't respond.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
building in New York. So that when you see it from

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and when you walk around to the other side it

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
looks like the balconies go down. So there are

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
cases where you have mistakes in design that

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
incorporate illusions.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Or, you take this particular un-retouched

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
of emails from people who say, "Is there any

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
perceptual difference between males and females?"

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
through the world just as well as males can -- and

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
why wouldn't they? However, this is the one

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
illusion that women can consistently do better

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
than males: in matching which head because they

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
design in illusions. I believe that the first

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
example of illusions being used purposely was by

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that when you saw from one little angle was like

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
this. And this little technique got popular in the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
16th century and the 17th century to disguise

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
see it from one little point of view like this.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But these are early incorporations of illusions

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
brought to -- sort of high point with Hans

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
could walk down from the stair and you can see

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this hidden skull.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
All right, now I'm going to show you some

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
designers who work with illusions to give that

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
here on TED and happiness.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
going to be a delightful talk and he has some of

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Ganson.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
was appropriate here.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And figure goes to ground.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And for the musicians.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
world."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Now, another great designer -- he's very well

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
builds some fantastic things. This is simply

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000
it from one particular angle, you see its

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Pianist transforms to violinist.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:28.000
together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
something in the sort of thing that I do, which

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
is there are people out there with a lot of time

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
on their hands.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
cabinets.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
created, some new type of illusions. I've done

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
you see these kids the same size here, running

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
down the hall. The two table tops of the same size.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
They're looking out two directions at once. You

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that's something for you to think about, all

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
is impossible. You can see the two kids are

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
looking out simultaneously out of two different

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
directions at once. Now can you believe these two

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
table tops are the same size and shape? They are.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
those two figures are identical in size and shape.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of rendered fashion, how much stronger the

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
you a little joy and happiness, and if you're

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
interested in seeing more cool effects, see me

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.
