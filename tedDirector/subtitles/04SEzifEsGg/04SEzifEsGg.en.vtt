00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I couldn't understand

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
the starvation, the destruction,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
the killing of innocent people.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Making sense of those things

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
is a very difficult thing to do.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
And when I was 12, I became an actor.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I was told I was dyslexic.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
In fact, I have got qualifications.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get --

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
which was useful, obviously.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And so concern

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
is where all of this comes from.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
this wonderful nuclear physicist,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
and he said that media had a responsibility,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
that all sectors of society had a responsibility

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
to try and progress things and move things forward.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And that fascinated me,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
to in some way make a difference.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So I started thinking about peace,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
and I was obviously, as I said to you,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
very much moved by these images,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
trying to make sense of that.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
who would tell me how they made sense

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of the things that are going on?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
But I realized that,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
having been messing around with structure as an actor,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that there needed to be a mountain to climb,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
there needed to be a journey that I had to take.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And if I took that journey,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The point was that I would have something

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Is that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
So I was thinking about peace,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
And that was when I had the idea.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
There was no starting point for peace.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
There was no day of global unity.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
There was no day when humanity came together,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
separate in all of those things

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
and just shared it together --

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that we're in this together,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
then that might be the key to humanity's survival.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
That might shift the level of consciousness

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
around the fundamental issues that humanity faces --

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
if we did it just for a day.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
So obviously we didn't have any money.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
I was living at my mom's place.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
And we started writing letters to everybody.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
to fathom that out.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
the 21st of September?

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
because it was my granddad's favorite number.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
He was a prisoner of war.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
So he was like my hero.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And the reason why 21 was the number is

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
700 men left, 23 came back,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
So we began this journey,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
and we launched it in 1999.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
And very quickly, some letters started coming back.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
And we started to build this case.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
And I remember the first letter.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
"This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
And we didn't have money for the flight.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And actually, let me go back to that slide,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
because when we launched it in 1999 --

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence --

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
we invited thousands of people.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people --

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
all the press, because we were going to try and create

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And we invited everybody,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
and no press showed up.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
For me, it was really about the process.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
It wasn't about the end result.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
and really empowering actually.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
So anyway, we began the journey.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
because every time I saw Kofi Annan,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
and that was kind of what was going on.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
(Laughter)

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
So Mary Robinson,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created."

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
said, "I must get the African countries involved."

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
president now of Costa Rica,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
said, "I'll do everything that I can."

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and so on and so on and so on --

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
while I was building the case

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
to prove whether this idea

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
would make sense.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
I've recorded 44,000 young people.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I'm really clear about how young people feel

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
when you talk to them about this idea

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
through their poetry, their art, their literature,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
their music, their sport, whatever it might be.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And we were listening to everybody.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and working with NGOs and building this case.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
I felt that I was presenting a case

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
on behalf of the global community

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
to try and create this day.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.260
the better chance we had of creating this day.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
And it was this stuff, this,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
where I actually was in the beginning

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
then I could make a statement

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
about how unwilling the global community is to unite --

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And this young child

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and that young boy who was a child soldier,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 --

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
these things made me realize

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
that this was not a film that I could just stop.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
If this is the only film that I ever make,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I'm going to document until this becomes a reality."

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
where we unite --

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
separate from all the politics and religion

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
that, as a young person, is confusing me.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
I don't know how to get involved in that process.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
The Costa Rican government and the British government

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
with 54 co-sponsors,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.260
(Applause)

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Yeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And thank you to all of them.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
That was an incredible moment.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And as I mentioned, when it started,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
we were at the Globe, and there was no press.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
to do a press conference.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
And it was obviously a tragic moment

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
for the thousands of people who lost their lives,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
there and then subsequently all over the world.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
It never happened.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And I remember thinking,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
"This is exactly why, actually,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
we have to work even harder.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
And we have to make this day work.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
It's been created; nobody knows.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
But we have to continue this journey,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
and we have to tell people,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
and we have to prove it can work."

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And I left New York freaked,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
but actually empowered.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.260
And I felt inspired

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
by the possibilities

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.260
that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
I was showing the film,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
by some guys having watched the film --

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan;

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
It's just symbolism.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And that was even worse

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
than actually what had just happened in many ways,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
because it couldn't not work.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
Children can lead their projects.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved."

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
That's what I'd heard.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
And so I went back to the United Nations.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
governments and NGOs,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
trying desperately to find somebody

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
to come forward and have a go at it,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
see if we could make it possible.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
one of my heroes and mentors really,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
he managed to get UNICEF involved.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
with UNAMA and WHO

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
and civil society, etc., etc., etc.?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
and I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and there's a chance."

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
And so I went back to London,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
And I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
I had a connection to him,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
because we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
we needed the media to be involved.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and there'd be more --

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
when we got into certain areas,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
maybe there would be more people interested.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
which had been desperately difficult.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
I won't go into that.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
I said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?"

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
It'd be really interesting if you came.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
It would help and bring attention.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
And that attention

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
would help leverage the situation,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
as well as all of the other sides of it."

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
I think there's a number of pillars to success.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
One is you've got to have a great idea.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and you've got to be able to raise awareness.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
So these guys were absolutely crucial.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
So he said yes,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
and we found ourselves in Afghanistan.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
"You've got to get everybody involved here.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
And we did, and we traveled around,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.260
and we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
we held press conferences, we went out with soldiers,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
we sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
we sat down with the U.K. government.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
I mean, we basically sat down with everybody --

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
in and out of schools with ministers of education,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
holding these press conferences,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
There was an interest in what was going on.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.260
This amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
And her Afghan network

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
was just absolutely everywhere.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And she was really crucial in getting the message in.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
We had to wait now and see what happened.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And I got home,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.260
from the Taliban.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
And that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
We will observe this day.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
We see it as a window of opportunity.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
And we will not engage. We're not going to engage."

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
And that meant that humanitarian workers

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
wouldn't be kidnapped or killed.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And days later,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
as a consequence of everybody stopping.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:05.260
(Applause)

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And like the General Assembly,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
because we had to go back.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
We went back to Afghanistan,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
But more importantly, we wanted to go back,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
They were the people who believed in peace

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And we wanted to go back and show them the film

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And we gave the film over.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
And then that year, that year, 2008,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th:

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
"General Stanley McChrystal,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
on the 21st of September."

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
They were saying they would stop.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
And then there was this other statement

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
saying that, in Afghanistan,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
because of this work,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
the violence was down by 70 percent.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And that completely blew my mind

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
almost more than anything.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
which was obviously much less harmful.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
And I was there thinking about what was going on.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
70 percent reduction in violence --

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
in what everyone said was completely impossible

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
and you couldn't do.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:38.260
then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
We have to go for a global truce.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
and go for a global truce,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
both domestically and internationally, ever recorded.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
That's exactly what we must do.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
And on the 21st of September this year,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
to go for that process,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.260
to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
And we will utilize all kinds of things --

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
have a dance and social media

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260
and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.260
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And we'll globally link with government, inter-government,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
non-government, education, unions, sports.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
And you can see the education box there.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.260
We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
trying to get young people to be the driving force

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
behind the vision of that global truce.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.260
And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
Linking up with the Olympics --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
I went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
Ultimately, that's what it's about."

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
Why don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
We'll make a new film about this process.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
We'll utilize sport and football.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
So, utilizing all of these ways

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
to inspire individual action.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And ultimately, we have to try that.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
We have to work together.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
And when I stand here in front of all of you,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
and the people who will watch these things,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.260
I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.260
that there is a possibility that our world could unite,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
that we could come together as one,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
brought about by individuals.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
I think he's one of the most incredible men

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
He's an amazing man.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
And I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
Is this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?"

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
He said, "It's absolutely possible."

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
I said, "What would you do?

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
It's all about the individuals.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
It's all about you and me.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
It's all about partnerships.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Because together, by working together,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.260
I seriously think we can start to change things.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.260
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal --

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
and he said, "I've been thinking about this day

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and imagining it as a square

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
with 365 squares,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.260
and one of them is white."

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
If you put one drop,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
one drop of something, in that water,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
it'll change it forever.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
By working together, we can create peace one day.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
Thank you TED. Thank you.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.260
(Applause)

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Thank you.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.260
(Applause)

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
Thanks a lot.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
(Applause)

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Thank you very much. Thank you.
