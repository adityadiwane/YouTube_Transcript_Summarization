00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330
in an echo-free chamber.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.330
Think of the AlloSphere as a large,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
dynamically varying digital microscope

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
that's connected to a supercomputer.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
20 researchers can stand on a bridge

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
suspended inside of the sphere, and be

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
completely immersed in their data.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.330
Imagine if a team of physicists

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
could stand inside of an atom

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
and watch and hear electrons spin.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.330
Imagine if a group of sculptors

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
could be inside of a lattice of atoms

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
and sculpt with their material.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
into the brain, as though it was a world,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.330
and see tissues as landscapes,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
and hear blood density levels as music.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
This is some of the research that you're going to see

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.330
that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
But first a little bit about this group

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
of artists, scientists, and engineers

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
that are working together.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and the inventor of the AlloSphere.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
With my visual artist colleagues, we map

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
visually and sonically.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
in the information.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330
And our engineering colleagues are making

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.330
one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
for this kind of data exploration.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
I'm going to fly you into five research projects

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
biological macroscopic data

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
all the way down to electron spin.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
This first project is called the AlloBrain.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330
by finding which regions of the brain

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
Our narrative here is real fMRI data

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
that's mapped visually and sonically.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
You see 12 intelligent computer agents,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330
They're mining blood density levels.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
Higher density levels mean

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
more activity in that point of the brain.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
They're actually singing these densities to you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
We're now going to move from real biological data

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.330
to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
in our next artistic and scientific installation.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.330
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
are helping us to understand

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
self-generation and growth:

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
For artists, we're making new worlds

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
that we can uncover and explore.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
These generative algorithms grow over time,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Our researchers are interacting with this data

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.330
by injecting bacterial code,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
which are computer programs,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
that allow these creatures to grow over time.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
We're going to move now from the biological

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
and the macroscopic world,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
down into the atomic world,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
as we fly into a lattice of atoms.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
They've discovered a new bond,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
a new material for transparent solar cells.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms --

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
You view the bond in the triangle.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
It's four blue zinc atoms

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.330
bonding with one white hydrogen atom.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
You see the electron flow with the streamlines

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
we as artists have generated for the scientists.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
The sound that you're hearing are the actual

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
emission spectrums of these atoms.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330
We've mapped them into the audio domain,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
so they're singing to you.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
We're going to actually move even further down

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
as we go from this lattice of atoms

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
to one single hydrogen atom.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
We're working with our physicist colleagues

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
that have given us the mathematical calculations

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.330
of the n-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation in time.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.330
in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.330
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
The white dots are the probability wave

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
that will show you where the electron is

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330
in any given point of time and space

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.330
in this particular three-orbital configuration.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and you're going to notice a pulsing.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
This is actually a light emitter.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
As the sound starts to pulse and contract,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.330
They're starting to find new mathematical structures

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
in these calculations.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
We're going to move even further down,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.330
and go to one single electron spin.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
This will be the final project that I show you.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.330
and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
decoherence in a single electron spin.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
We've taken this information and we've

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
made a mathematical model out of it.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
You're actually seeing and hearing

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
quantum information flow.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
This is very important for the next step in simulating

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.330
quantum computers and information technology.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
So these brief examples that I've shown you

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
to bring together, arts, science

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
and engineering

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
into a new age of math, science and art.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Thank you very much.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.330
(Applause)
