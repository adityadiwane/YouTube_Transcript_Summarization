00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
What do I know

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
that would cause me,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
a reticent, Midwestern scientist,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
to get myself arrested

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in front of the White House protesting?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
And what would you do

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
if you knew what I know?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Let's start with how I got to this point.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
I was lucky to grow up

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
at a time when it was not difficult

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
for the child of a tenant farmer

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
to make his way to the state university.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
And I was really lucky

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
to go to the University of Iowa

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
where I could study under Professor James Van Allen

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
who built instruments

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
for the first U.S. satellites.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Professor Van Allen told me

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
about observations of Venus,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
that there was intense microwave radiation.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Or was Venus extremely hot?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
The right answer,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.260
confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
was that Venus was very hot --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
900 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
And it was kept hot

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I was fortunate to join NASA

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and successfully propose

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
an experiment to fly to Venus.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
Our instrument took this image

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
of the veil of Venus,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
which turned out to be

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
a smog of sulfuric acid.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
But while our instrument was being built,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
I became involved in calculations

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
of the greenhouse effect

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
here on Earth,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
because we realized

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
that our atmospheric composition was changing.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Eventually, I resigned

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
as principal investigator

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
on our Venus experiment

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
because a planet changing before our eyes

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
is more interesting and important.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
Its changes will affect all of humanity.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
The greenhouse effect had been well understood

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
for more than a century.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
British physicist John Tyndall,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
in the 1850's,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
made laboratory measurements

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
of the infrared radiation,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
which is heat.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
thus acting like a blanket

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
warming Earth's surface.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
I worked with other scientists

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.260
to analyze Earth climate observations.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
In 1981,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
we published an article in Science magazine

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
concluding that observed warming

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
of 0.4 degrees Celsius

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
in the prior century

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
was consistent with the greenhouse effect

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
of increasing CO2.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
and warming would exceed

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
the noise level of random weather

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
by the end of the century.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
We also said that the 21st century

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
would see shifting climate zones,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
creation of drought-prone regions

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
in North America and Asia,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
All of these impacts

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
have since either happened

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
or are now well under way.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.260
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
and led to me testifying to Congress

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
in the 1980's,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
testimony in which I emphasized

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
that global warming increases both extremes

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
of the Earth's water cycle.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
directly from the warming,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
but also, because a warmer atmosphere

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
holds more water vapor

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
with its latent energy,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
rainfall will become

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
in more extreme events.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Global warming hoopla

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
became time-consuming

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and distracted me from doing science --

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
partly because I had complained

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
that the White House altered my testimony.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
So I decided to go back

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to strictly doing science

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.260
and leave the communication to others.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
By 15 years later,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
evidence of global warming was much stronger.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
were facts.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
I had the privilege to speak twice

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
to the president's climate task force.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
But energy policies continued to focus

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
on finding more fossil fuels.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
By then we had two grandchildren,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Sophie and Connor.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
I decided

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
that I did not want them in the future

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
to say, "Opa understood what was happening,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
but he didn't make it clear."

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
So I decided to give a public talk

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
and at the 2005 meeting

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
of the American Geophysical Union.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
This led to calls

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
from the White House to NASA headquarters

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
without prior explicit approval

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
by NASA headquarters.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
After I informed the New York Times

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
about these restrictions,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
NASA was forced to end the censorship.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
But there were consequences.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
I had been using the first line

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
of the NASA mission statement,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
"To understand and protect the home planet,"

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
to justify my talks.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
Soon the first line of the mission statement

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.260
was deleted, never to appear again.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
Over the next few years

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
I was drawn more and more

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
into trying to communicate the urgency

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
of a change in energy policies,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
while still researching the physics of climate change.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics --

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
first, from Earth's energy balance

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.260
and, second, from Earth's climate history.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Adding CO2 to the air

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
is like throwing another blanket on the bed.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
so there's a temporary energy imbalance.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
More energy is coming in

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
than going out,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
until Earth warms up enough

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
to again radiate to space

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
So the key quantity

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
is Earth's energy imbalance.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Is there more energy coming in

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
than going out?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.260
If so, more warming is in the pipeline.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.260
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Now finally,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.260
we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
by measuring the heat content

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
in Earth's heat reservoirs.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
until more than 3,000 Argo floats

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
were distributed around the world's ocean.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
These floats reveal

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
that the upper half of the ocean

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is gaining heat at a substantial rate.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.260
and energy is going

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
into the net melting of ice all around the planet.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
And the land, to depths of tens of meters,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
is also warming.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
The total energy imbalance now

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.260
is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
That may not sound like much,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.260
but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
It's about 20 times greater

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
It's equivalent to exploding

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.260
400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
365 days per year.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
That's how much extra energy

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Earth is gaining each day.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
This imbalance,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.260
if we want to stabilize climate,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
means that we must reduce CO2

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
from 391 ppm, parts per million,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
back to 350 ppm.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.260
That is the change needed to restore energy balance

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
and prevent further warming.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.260
Climate change deniers argue

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.260
But the measured energy imbalance occurred

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
during the deepest solar minimum in the record,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
mainly from burning fossil fuels.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now consider Earth's climate history.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
These curves for global temperature,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.260
atmospheric CO2 and sea level

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
from ocean sediments and snowflakes

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
that piled up year after year

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
over 800,000 years

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
As you see, there's a high correlation

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
between temperature, CO2 and sea level.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Careful examination shows

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
that the temperature changes

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
slightly lead the CO2 changes

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
by a few centuries.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Climate change deniers like to use this fact

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
to confuse and trick the public

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
by saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
not vice versa."

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
But that lag

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
is exactly what is expected.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
Small changes in Earth's orbit

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
alter the distribution

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
of sunlight on Earth.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
When there is more sunlight

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Shrinking ice sheets

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
make the planet darker,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
so it absorbs more sunlight

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
and becomes warmer.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
A warmer ocean releases CO2,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
just as a warm Coca-Cola does.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And more CO2 causes more warming.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
So CO2, methane, and ice sheets

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
were feedbacks

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
that amplified global temperature change

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
even though the climate change was initiated

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
by a very weak forcing.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
The important point

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
is that these same amplifying feedbacks

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
will occur today.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
The physics does not change.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
As Earth warms,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
ice will melt,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
and CO2 and methane will be released

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
by warming ocean and melting permafrost.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
While we can't say exactly how fast

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
these amplifying feedbacks will occur,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
it is certain they will occur,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
unless we stop the warming.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
There is evidence

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
that feedbacks are already beginning.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Precise measurements

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
by GRACE, the gravity satellite,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
are now losing mass,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
several hundred cubic kilometers per year.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
And the rate has accelerated

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
since the measurements began

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
nine years ago.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Methane is also beginning

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
to escape from the permafrost.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
What sea level rise

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
can we look forward to?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
today's value,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
sea level was higher

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
by at least 15 meters, 50 feet.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Where you are sitting now

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
would be under water.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Most estimates are that, this century,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
we will get at least one meter.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
I think it will be more

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
if we keep burning fossil fuels,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
this century or shortly thereafter.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
The important point

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
is that we will have started a process

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
that is out of humanity's control.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
There would be no stable shoreline.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
around the world.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
What may be more reprehensible,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
if climate denial continues,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
is extermination of species.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
The monarch butterfly

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.260
could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
will be ticketed for extinction

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
by the end of the century

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260
if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
Global warming is already affecting people.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
heatwave and drought last year,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
Moscow the year before

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
and Europe in 2003,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
were all exceptional events,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.260
more than three standard deviations outside the norm.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Fifty years ago,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
such anomalies

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
covered only two- to three-tenths

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
of one percent of the land area.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
In recent years,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
because of global warming,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
they now cover about 10 percent --

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
an increase by a factor of 25 to 50.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
So we can say with a high degree of confidence

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
were not natural;

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
they were caused by global warming.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
An important impact,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
if global warming continues,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.260
the Midwest and Great Plains,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
worse than the Dust Bowl,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
within just a few decades,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
if we let global warming continue.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
into an attempt to communicate,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
giving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
burning up the vacation time

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.260
that I had accumulated over 30 years?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
More grandchildren helped me along.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Jake is a super-positive,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
enthusiastic boy.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Here at age two and a half years,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
he thinks he can protect

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
his two and a half-day-old little sister.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
It would be immoral

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
to leave these young people

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
with a climate system

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
spiraling out of control.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Now the tragedy about climate change

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
is that we can solve it

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
with a simple, honest approach

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
of a gradually rising carbon fee

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
collected from fossil fuel companies

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.260
and distributed 100 percent electronically

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
every month to all legal residents

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
on a per capita basis,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.260
with the government not keeping one dime.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
than they'd pay in increased prices.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
This fee and dividend

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
would stimulate the economy

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
and innovations,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
creating millions of jobs.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
It is the principal requirement

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
for moving us rapidly

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
to a clean energy future.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Several top economists

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
are coauthors on this proposition.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
describes it thusly:

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
"Transparent. Market-based.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
Does not enlarge government.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.260
Sounds like a conservative climate plan."

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.260
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
to make fossil fuels pay

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
their true cost to society,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
our governments are forcing the public

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
to subsidize fossil fuels

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
by 400 to 500 billion dollars

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
per year worldwide,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260
thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel --

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
mountaintop removal,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
longwall mining, fracking,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
tar sands, tar shale,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
deep ocean Arctic drilling.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
This path, if continued,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
guarantees that we will pass tipping points

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
leading to ice sheet disintegration

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.260
that will accelerate out of control of future generations.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
A large fraction of species

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
will be committed to extinction.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
will severely impact breadbaskets of the world,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
causing massive famines

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and economic decline.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260
Imagine a giant asteroid

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.260
on a direct collision course with Earth.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
That is the equivalent

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
of what we face now.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
Yet, we dither,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.260
taking no action

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260
to divert the asteroid,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
even though the longer we wait,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.260
the more difficult and expensive it becomes.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
If we had started in 2005,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
to restore planetary energy balance

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.260
and stabilize climate this century.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260
If we start next year,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
it is six percent per year.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.260
If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year --

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
extremely difficult and expensive,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260
perhaps impossible.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
But we aren't even starting.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
So now you know what I know

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
that is moving me to sound this alarm.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.260
Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.260
The science is clear.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
I need your help

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
to communicate the gravity and the urgency

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
of this situation

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260
and its solutions

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.260
more effectively.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.260
We owe it to our children and grandchildren.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
Thank you.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.260
(Applause)
