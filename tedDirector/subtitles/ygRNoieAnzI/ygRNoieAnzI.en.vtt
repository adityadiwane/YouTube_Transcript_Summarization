00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:19.451
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.164
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:25.034
so I've never seen color,

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:27.557
and I don't know what color looks like,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:30.532
because I come from a grayscale world.

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:33.192
To me, the sky is always gray,

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:35.044
flowers are always gray,

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:37.246
and television is still in black and white.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.539
But, since the age of 21,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.668
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.644
In 2003, I started a project

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:49.332
with computer scientist Adam Montandon,

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:52.499
and the result, with further collaborations

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.347
with Peter Kese from Slovenia

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.380
and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.745
is this electronic eye.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:02.101
It's a color sensor that detects

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:05.684
the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:08.036
and sends this frequency to a chip installed

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:11.027
at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me

00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:13.923
through the bone, through bone conduction.

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:17.431
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:23.951
This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:31.369
For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.494
This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:37.863
This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.740
Which is like yellow, this one.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.797
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,

00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:46.432
since 2004, so I find it completely normal now

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:48.911
to hear color all the time.

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:53.285
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.691
for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:57.627
but after some time, all this information

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.620
became a perception.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.379
I didn't have to think about the notes.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:04.004
And after some time, this perception became a feeling.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.010
I started to have favorite colors,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.784
and I started to dream in colors.

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:12.059
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.946
that the software and my brain had united,

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:17.902
because in my dreams, it was my brain creating

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:20.263
electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:23.782
so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:26.832
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:29.022
was no longer a device.

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:31.437
It had become a part of my body,

00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:33.902
an extension of my senses,

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:36.528
and after some time, it even became a part

00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:40.055
of my official image.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.401
This is my passport from 2004.

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:45.486
You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.298
with electronic equipment, but I insisted

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:50.699
to the passport office that what they were seeing

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.203
was actually a new part of my body,

00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:56.723
an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me

00:02:56.723 --> 00:02:59.234
to appear with the passport photo.

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:02.691
So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:05.285
because color is almost everywhere,

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:08.162
so the biggest change for example is

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:12.700
going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.554
for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:17.765
because I can listen to the paintings.

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.226
And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:23.176
it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:24.664
It's like going to a nightclub.

00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:27.920
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.995
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:33.346
It's just fabulous. (Laughter)

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.818
Also, the way I dress has changed.

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:38.226
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:42.803
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)

00:03:42.803 --> 00:03:47.934
(Applause)

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.443
So today I'm dressed in C major,

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:53.752
so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:55.626
If I had to go to a funeral, though,

00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:58.193
I would dress in B minor, which would be

00:03:58.193 --> 00:04:06.952
turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:11.297
Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,

00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:14.753
because now I can display the food on a plate,

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.705
so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:18.934
So depending on how I display it,

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.684
I can hear and I can compose music with food.

00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:24.409
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.393
Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:30.410
this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.849
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.083
as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:40.192
that would be a very exciting restaurant

00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:42.952
where you can actually eat songs.

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:47.402
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:52.082
because when I look at someone, I hear their face,

00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:57.084
so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.

00:04:57.084 --> 00:04:58.845
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,

00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:01.093
the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:02.822
sound portraits of people.

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:06.462
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,

00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:08.893
I point at them with the eye and I write down

00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:12.164
the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.

00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:13.901
Here's some faces.

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:28.428
(Musical chords)

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:31.861
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)

00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.910
Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.708
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:39.845
They have similar sound of eyes.

00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:41.893
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:45.406
and you can actually also create concerts

00:05:45.406 --> 00:05:48.046
by looking at the audience faces.

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.142
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.646
The good thing about this is,

00:05:52.646 --> 00:05:55.613
if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.884
It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)

00:05:57.884 --> 00:06:02.191
And so another thing that happens is that

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:05.068
I started having this secondary effect

00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:08.398
that normal sounds started to become color.

00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:12.159
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.485
because it sounded just like the color green.

00:06:14.485 --> 00:06:17.783
The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:20.910
and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.670
so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.613
because people's voices have frequencies

00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:29.156
that I relate to color.

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:34.275
And here's some music translated into color.

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:39.475
For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.

00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:41.287
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,

00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:43.477
because there's many different frequencies.

00:06:43.477 --> 00:06:46.387
(Music)

00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:49.717
And this is a completely different song.

00:06:49.717 --> 00:06:53.648
(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:55.379
(Music)

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.949
It is very pink and very yellow.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:06.116
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,

00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:09.660
for example, these are two very well-known speeches.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.397
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:14.849
and the other one is Hitler.

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.325
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls

00:07:18.325 --> 00:07:20.901
without labels, and then I ask people,

00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:22.748
"Which one do you prefer?"

00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:25.013
And most people change their preference

00:07:25.013 --> 00:07:27.924
when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler

00:07:27.924 --> 00:07:31.044
and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.

00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:36.783
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,

00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:38.368
just like human vision.

00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:41.963
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:44.045
But then, I just thought that

00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:47.284
this human vision wasn't good enough.

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:49.495
There's many, many more colors around us

00:07:49.495 --> 00:07:51.332
that we cannot perceive,

00:07:51.332 --> 00:07:53.088
but that electronic eyes can perceive.

00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:56.817
So I decided to continue extending my color senses,

00:07:56.817 --> 00:08:01.067
and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet

00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:04.425
to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:06.649
that the human eye cannot perceive.

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:10.096
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can

00:08:10.096 --> 00:08:14.164
actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:17.617
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.

00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:20.767
And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:25.732
you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:27.889
because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.873
a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish

00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:34.834
to perceive things that we cannot perceive.

00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:36.569
That's why, two years ago,

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:38.250
I created the Cyborg Foundation,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.692
which is a foundation that tries to help people

00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:43.389
become a cyborg, tries to encourage people

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.766
to extend their senses

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:47.837
by using technology as part of the body.

00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:51.740
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.716
so if we extend our senses,

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:56.804
we will consequently extend our knowledge.

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:59.597
I think life will be much more exciting

00:08:59.597 --> 00:09:02.821
when we stop creating applications for mobile phones

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.222
and we start creating applications for our own body.

00:09:06.222 --> 00:09:08.038
I think this will be a big, big change

00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:10.116
that we will see during this century.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:14.031
So I do encourage you all to think about which senses

00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:15.450
you'd like to extend.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.623
I would encourage you to become a cyborg.

00:09:18.623 --> 00:09:23.271
You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:29.791
(Applause)
