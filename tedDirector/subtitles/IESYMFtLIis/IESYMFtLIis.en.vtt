00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.330
the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
and so on. And within the last decade or two,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.330
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
underlying many of these past collapses.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.330
But there were also plenty of places in the world

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
where societies have been developing for thousands of years

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
without any sign of a major collapse,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.330
than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
to our situation today, because today as well, there are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.330
societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
What about ourselves?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.330
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Obviously the answer to this question is not going

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.330
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.330
to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
This is a European society with literate records,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.330
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
and every one of them ended up dead.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.330
base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
which was a particular problem for them because

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.330
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.330
climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.330
isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.330
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.330
and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.330
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.330
got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.330
may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330
the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.330
more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.330
environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330
cultural factors that made it difficult for them

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
to solve their problems were: their commitments to a

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.330
a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.330
framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
What about a society today?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
like the most pristine environment in the United States.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.330
But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
have caused damage of billions of dollars.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.330
200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
from salinization, problems of forest management,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.330
and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.330
from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.330
that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.330
but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
social security, investments and so on --

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.330
Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.330
created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.330
and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.330
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.330
and to no government regulation; values that worked well

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.330
in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.330
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.330
Are there any general conclusions that arise?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.330
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.330
they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
common threads that emerge from these comparisons

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
of past societies that did or did not collapse

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.330
and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.330
has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330
after their peak, they collapse. For example,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.330
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:20.330
their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.330
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.330
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.330
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.330
a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.330
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.330
half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.330
being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
So, this is a frequent theme:

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.330
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.330
about a society today, you should be looking not at the value

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.330
of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.330
is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.330
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.330
the most devastating case of complete deforestation?

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.330
factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.330
the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.330
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.330
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.330
a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
are more fragile than others. And then finally,

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.330
another generalization. I'm now teaching a course

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.330
how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.330
not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:13.330
And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
then maybe in the next century people will be asking,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.330
incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.330
trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
about why societies fail to solve their problems --

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.330
why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.330
why do they fail to succeed in solving them?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.330
interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.330
interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.330
are able to insulate themselves from the consequences

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.330
of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.330
is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
For example, among the Greenland Norse --

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
is more followers and more sheep and more resources

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330
to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.330
forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.330
the chiefs powerful in the short run,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.330
but led to the society's collapse in the long run.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.330
Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.330
in the United States today. Especially because

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.330
the decision makers in the United States are frequently

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
able to insulate themselves from consequences

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
and so on. And within the last couple of years,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.330
it's been obvious that the elite in the business world

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
correctly perceive that they can advance

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.330
their short-term interest by doing things that are

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
good for them but bad for society as a whole,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.330
such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
and other businesses. They are quite correct

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
that these things are good for them in the short term,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
although bad for society in the long term.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
So, that's one general conclusion about why societies

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.330
make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
And the other generalization that I want to mention

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.330
is that it's particularly hard for a society to make

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:48.330
quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.330
strongly held values that are good in many circumstances

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
but are poor in other circumstances. For example,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
were held together for four-and-a-half centuries

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
by their shared commitment to religion,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.330
and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.330
commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
also made it difficult for them to change at the end

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
in this remote outpost of European civilization

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.330
for 250 years has been their British identity.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.330
But today, their commitment to a British identity

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.330
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.330
to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.330
to change course when the things that get you in trouble

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.330
are the things that are also the source of your strength.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
What's going to be the outcome today?

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:55.330
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:01.330
going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.330
and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.330
of soil, of climate change, invasive species,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.330
the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.330
the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.330
one year away from losing their loggable forest,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.330
which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.330
for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.330
about the world's environmental problems?

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.330
is to forget about there being any single thing that is

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.330
the most important thing we need to do.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.330
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.330
but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:23.330
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:33.330
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
That means that those of us in this room who are less than

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.330
50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.330
and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.330
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.330
either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.330
in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
or else these conflicts are going to get settled

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.330
disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.330
non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.330
in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.330
is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.330
get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.330
The big problems facing the world today are not at all

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.330
things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.330
Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.330
entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.330
we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.330
entirely in our power to deal with these problems.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.330
In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.330
who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.330
you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.330
and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.330
we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
we need to be doing. Thank you.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.330
(Applause)
