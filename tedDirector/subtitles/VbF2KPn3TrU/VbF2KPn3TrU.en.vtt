00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:21.015
In 2002, a group of treatment activists met

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.045
to discuss the early development of the airplane.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:29.746
The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.448
had for the first time managed

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.020
to make one of those devices fly.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.283
They also had taken out numerous patents

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.259
on essential parts of the airplane.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.700
They were not the only ones.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.284
That was common practice in the industry,

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.576
and those who held patents on airplanes

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.732
were defending them fiercely

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:51.154
and suing competitors left and right.

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:56.071
This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.377
and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:01.934
was interested in ramping up

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.623
the production of military airplanes.

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:07.334
So there was a bit of a conflict there.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.573
The U.S. government decided to take action,

00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:12.905
and forced those patent holders

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:17.066
to make their patents available to share with others

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:22.575
to enable the production of airplanes.

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:25.545
So what has this

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:29.565
got to do with this?

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:34.628
In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:39.769
discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:44.004
He was told that a cure did not exist.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.207
AIDS, he heard, was lethal,

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.400
and treatment was not offered. This was at a time

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.168
that treatment actually existed in rich countries.

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:56.163
AIDS had become a chronic disease.

00:01:56.163 --> 00:01:59.764
People in our countries here in Europe, in North America,

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.709
were living with HIV, healthy lives.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.544
Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:09.516
and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:12.756
also had HIV.

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:16.176
Nelson decided to become a treatment activist

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:18.305
and join up with other groups.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:24.648
In 2002, they were facing a different battle.

00:02:24.648 --> 00:02:29.363
Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,

00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:33.760
cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.285
The patents on those drugs were held

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:42.056
by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:44.977
that were not necessarily willing

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:48.218
to make those patents available.

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:50.390
When you have a patent, you can exclude

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.119
anyone else from making, from producing or making

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.117
low-cost versions, for example,

00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:01.693
available of those medications.

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:05.954
Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.912
all over the globe.

00:03:08.912 --> 00:03:12.573
Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:14.965
There were countries that did not recognize

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:17.884
pharmaceutical product patents, such as India,

00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:20.405
and Indian pharmaceutical companies

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:24.364
started to produce so-called generic versions,

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:28.831
low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.128
and make them available in the developing world,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.844
and within a year the price had come down

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:38.630
from 10,000 dollars per patient per year

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.132
to 350 dollars per patient per year,

00:03:41.132 --> 00:03:44.648
and today that same triple pill cocktail

00:03:44.648 --> 00:03:47.484
is available for 60 dollars per patient per year,

00:03:47.484 --> 00:03:50.848
and of course that started to have an enormous effect

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:53.937
on the number of people who could afford access

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:55.427
to those medicines.

00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:58.005
Treatment programs became possible,

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.119
funding became available, and the number of people

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:07.880
on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.593
Today, eight million people

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.709
have access to antiretroviral drugs.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.691
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.690
Never has this number been so high,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.932
but actually this is good news,

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:23.565
because what it means is people stop dying.

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:25.885
People who have access to these drugs stop dying.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:27.221
And there's something else.

00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.005
They also stop passing on the virus.

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.667
This is fairly recent science that has shown that.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:36.323
What that means is we have the tools

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:40.080
to break the back of this epidemic.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.349
So what's the problem?

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.215
Well, things have changed.

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:51.043
First of all, the rules have changed.

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:56.974
Today, all countries are obliged to provide

00:04:56.974 --> 00:05:01.496
patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.

00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:04.432
This is as a result of the intellectual property rules

00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:06.780
of the World Trade Organization.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.959
So what India did is no longer possible.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:15.296
Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:19.680
Here you see the patent practices

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.769
before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:26.154
before antiretroviral drugs.

00:05:26.154 --> 00:05:28.854
This is what you see today,

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:31.542
and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.965
unless we do something deliberate

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:36.348
and unless we do something now,

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:41.464
we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:43.684
because new drugs are developed,

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:47.046
new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:50.115
in a much wider range of countries.

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:54.752
So unless we act, unless we do something today,

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:58.684
we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed

00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:01.728
the treatment time bomb.

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:06.587
It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.

00:06:06.587 --> 00:06:09.370
There's something else that can really scare

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.211
generic manufacturers away.

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.212
This shows you a patent landscape.

00:06:15.212 --> 00:06:18.896
This is the landscape of one medicine.

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:21.497
So you can imagine that if you are a generic company

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:23.490
about to decide whether to invest

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.626
in the development of this product, unless you know

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:29.129
that the licenses to these patents

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.627
are actually going to be available,

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:34.679
you will probably choose to do something else.

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.612
Again, deliberate action is needed.

00:06:38.612 --> 00:06:41.009
So surely

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.936
if a patent pool could be established

00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:48.997
to ramp up the production of military airplanes,

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.531
we should be able to do something similar

00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:56.238
to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

00:06:56.238 --> 00:06:58.301
And we did.

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:03.690
In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.173
for HIV.

00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:08.802
And this is how it works:

00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:12.473
Patent holders, inventors

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:16.318
that develop new medicines

00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:18.884
patent those inventions,

00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:20.635
but make those patents available

00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:23.608
to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:27.423
then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.

00:07:27.423 --> 00:07:29.099
That can be generic manufacturers.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.912
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:34.389
for example.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:36.903
Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines

00:07:36.903 --> 00:07:41.952
at much lower cost to people who need access to them,

00:07:41.952 --> 00:07:44.524
to treatment programs that need access to them.

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:48.700
They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:59.029
so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:03.087
There is one key difference

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:06.447
with the airplane patent pool.

00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:11.364
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.

00:08:11.364 --> 00:08:14.796
The airplane patent holders were not left a choice

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:16.436
whether they'd license their patents or not.

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.640
They were forced to do so.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.562
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.

00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:25.914
It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies

00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:29.484
to license their patents and make them available

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:34.024
for others to use.

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:39.189
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:43.171
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.

00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:46.948
His son will soon be 14 years old.

00:08:46.948 --> 00:08:49.518
Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group

00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:51.977
of the Medicines Patent Pool,

00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:54.078
and he told me not so long ago,

00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:59.619
"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:03.018
on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure

00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:08.530
that new medicines also become available to us,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.919
that new medicines, without delay, become available to us."

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:17.278
And this is no longer fantasy.

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:21.757
Already, I'll give you an example.

00:09:21.757 --> 00:09:25.215
In August of this year, the United States drug agency

00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:29.164
approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.

00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:31.869
The company, Gilead, that holds the patents,

00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:36.105
has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:40.032
The pool is already working today, two months later,

00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:43.137
with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product

00:09:43.137 --> 00:09:46.286
can go to market at low cost

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.696
where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.

00:09:49.696 --> 00:09:51.636
This has never been done before.

00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:55.355
The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product

00:09:55.355 --> 00:09:58.326
to go to market in developing countries, if at all.

00:09:58.326 --> 00:10:02.359
This has never been seen before.

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:05.863
Nelson's expectations are very high,

00:10:05.863 --> 00:10:10.132
and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access

00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:13.221
to the next generation of antiretrovirals

00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:16.328
and the next, throughout their lifetime,

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:21.006
so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries

00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:25.438
can continue to live healthy, active lives.

00:10:25.438 --> 00:10:28.658
Now we count on the willingness of drug companies

00:10:28.658 --> 00:10:31.280
to make that happen. We count on those companies

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.700
that understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.884
of the global good, but also in their own interest,

00:10:37.884 --> 00:10:43.598
to move from conflict to collaboration,

00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.479
and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.875
They can also choose not to do that,

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:56.086
but those that go down that road may end up

00:10:56.086 --> 00:10:59.010
in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.844
early last century, facing forcible measures

00:11:02.844 --> 00:11:08.026
by government. So they'd better jump now.

00:11:08.026 --> 00:11:11.363
Thank you. (Applause)
