00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.029
I, like many of you,

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:24.100
am one of the two billion people
on Earth who live in cities.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.650
And there are days --
I don't know about the rest of you --

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:31.236
but there are days when I palpably feel

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.737
how much I rely on other people

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.114
for pretty much everything in my life.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.273
And some days, that can even
be a little scary.

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:42.038
But what I'm here
to talk to you about today

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.844
is how that same interdependence

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:49.357
is actually an extremely
powerful social infrastructure

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.365
that we can actually harness

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.800
to help heal some
of our deepest civic issues,

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:59.541
if we apply open-source collaboration.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:01.592
A couple of years ago,

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:05.114
I read an article by New York Times
writer Michael Pollan,

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:09.237
in which he argued that growing
even some of our own food

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:12.431
is one of the best things
that we can do for the environment.

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.201
Now at the time that I was reading this,

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.866
it was the middle of the winter

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.197
and I definitely did not have room
for a lot of dirt

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.350
in my New York City apartment.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.340
So I was basically just willing to settle

00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:26.310
for just reading the next Wired magazine

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.954
and finding out how the experts
were going to figure out

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:32.054
how to solve all these problems
for us in the future.

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:34.327
But that was actually exactly the point

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.637
that Michael Pollan
was making in this article --

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.870
it's precisely when we hand over

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:42.136
the responsibility
for all these things to specialists

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.874
that we cause the kind of messes
that we see with the food system.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.594
So, I happen to know
a little bit from my own work

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:54.873
about how NASA has been using hydroponics

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:57.612
to explore growing food in space.

00:01:58.144 --> 00:02:02.559
And that you can actually
get optimal nutritional yield

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:08.323
by running a kind of high-quality
liquid soil over plants' root systems.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.776
Now to a vegetable plant,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.286
my apartment has got to be
about as foreign as outer space.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.771
But I can offer some natural light

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:19.815
and year-round climate control.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.186
Fast-forward two years later:

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.934
we now have window farms,

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.011
which are vertical, hydroponic platforms

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.353
for food-growing indoors.

00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:31.639
And the way it works
is that there's a pump at the bottom,

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:35.216
which periodically sends this liquid
nutrient solution up to the top,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.884
which then trickles down
through plants' root systems

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.049
that are suspended in clay pellets --

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:41.726
so there's no dirt involved.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:47.274
Now light and temperature vary
with each window's microclimate,

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:51.056
so a window farm requires a farmer,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.577
and she must decide

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:56.336
what kind of crops she is going
to put in her window farm,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.269
and whether she is going
to feed her food organically.

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:01.444
Back at the time,

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:04.649
a window farm was no more
than a technically complex idea

00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:06.864
that was going to require
a lot of testing.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.010
And I really wanted it
to be an open project,

00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:11.236
because hydroponics

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.976
is one of the fastest
growing areas of patenting

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.662
in the United States right now,

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:19.357
and could possibly become
another area like Monsanto,

00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:22.421
where we have a lot of corporate
intellectual property

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:24.770
in the way of people's food.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.995
So I decided that,
instead of creating a product,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.186
what I was going to do

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.260
was open this up
to a whole bunch of codevelopers.

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.381
The first few systems that we created,
they kind of worked.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:39.739
We were actually able to grow
about a salad a week

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:42.153
in a typical New York City
apartment window.

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:44.206
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.210
and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:47.713
But the first few systems

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:51.268
were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.050
that Martha Stewart
would definitely never have approved.

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:55.922
(Laughter)

00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:58.331
So to bring on more codevelopers,

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:01.257
what we did was we created
a social media site

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:03.226
on which we published the designs,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.244
we explained how they worked,

00:04:05.268 --> 00:04:07.647
and we even went so far

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:10.915
as to point out everything
that was wrong with these systems.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.307
And then we invited people
all over the world

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.427
to build them and experiment with us.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.783
So actually now on this website,

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:21.504
we have 18,000 people.

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.958
And we have window farms
all over the world.

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:29.473
What we're doing
is what NASA or a large corporation

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:32.988
would call R&amp;D,
or research and development.

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:35.925
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y,

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.588
or "research and develop it yourself."

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.084
(Laughter)

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:42.663
So, for example, Jackson came along

00:04:42.687 --> 00:04:45.838
and suggested that we use air pumps
instead of water pumps.

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:48.577
It took building a whole bunch
of systems to get it right,

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:52.373
but once we did, we were able to cut
our carbon footprint nearly in half.

00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:56.118
Tony in Chicago has been taking on
growing experiments,

00:04:56.142 --> 00:04:57.796
like lots of other window farmers,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.783
and he's been able to get
his strawberries to fruit

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:03.566
for nine months of the year
in low-light conditions

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.567
by simply changing out
the organic nutrients.

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.915
And window farmers in Finland
have been customizing their window farms

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.279
for the dark days of the Finnish winters

00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:16.380
by outfitting them with LED grow lights

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:19.697
that they're now making
open source and part of the project.

00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.090
So window farms have been evolving

00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:25.404
through a rapid versioning process
similar to software.

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:28.569
And with every open source project,

00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:30.307
the real benefit is the interplay

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:34.770
between the specific concerns
of people customizing their systems

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:36.613
for their own particular concerns,

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:38.685
and the universal concerns.

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:40.642
So my core team and I

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:43.216
are able to concentrate
on the improvements

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.484
that really benefit everyone.

00:05:45.508 --> 00:05:48.727
And we're able to look out
for the needs of newcomers.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.481
So for do-it-yourselfers,

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:54.627
we provide free,
very well-tested instructions

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:56.736
so that anyone, anywhere around the world,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.909
can build one of these systems for free.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:01.655
And there's a patent pending
on these systems as well

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.446
that's held by the community.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.374
And to fund the project,

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.700
we partner to create products

00:06:07.724 --> 00:06:10.601
that we then sell
to schools and to individuals

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:13.123
who don't have time
to build their own systems.

00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:17.461
Now within our community,
a certain culture has appeared.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:20.198
In our culture,
it is better to be a tester

00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:22.491
who supports someone else's idea

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.903
than it is to be just the idea guy.

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:29.837
What we get out of this project
is support for our own work,

00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:33.782
as well as an experience
of actually contributing

00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:35.932
to the environmental movement

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:38.883
in a way other than just
screwing in new light bulbs.

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:42.062
But I think that Eleen expresses best

00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:43.563
what we really get out of this,

00:06:43.587 --> 00:06:46.422
which is the actual joy of collaboration.

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:49.236
So she expresses here what it's like

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.737
to see someone halfway across the world

00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:54.063
having taken your idea, built upon it

00:06:54.087 --> 00:06:56.236
and then acknowledging
you for contributing.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.707
If we really want to see
the kind of wide consumer behavior change

00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:04.386
that we're all talking about
as environmentalists and food people,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.795
maybe we just need
to ditch the term "consumer"

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.635
and get behind the people
who are doing stuff.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.811
Open source projects
tend to have a momentum of their own.

00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:15.875
And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.678
has moved beyond
just window farms and LEDs

00:07:19.702 --> 00:07:23.130
into solar panels and aquaponic systems.

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:27.811
And we're building upon innovations
of generations who went before us.

00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.649
And we're looking ahead at generations

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:32.593
who really need us
to retool our lives now.

00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:35.440
So we ask that you join us

00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:39.790
in rediscovering the value
of citizens united,

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:43.610
and to declare
that we are all still pioneers.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.458
(Applause)
