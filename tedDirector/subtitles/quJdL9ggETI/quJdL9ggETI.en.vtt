00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.500
What do you think of when I say the word "design"?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.820
You probably think of things like this,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.331
finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:25.260
or maybe logos and posters and maps

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.181
that visually explain things,

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.339
classic icons of timeless design.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.220
But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.375
I want to talk about the kind

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.404
that you probably use every day

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:38.165
and may not give much thought to,

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:40.276
designs that change all the time

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:42.533
and that live inside your pocket.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.596
I'm talking about the design

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.651
of digital experiences

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.387
and specifically the design of systems

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:51.020
that are so big that their scale

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.111
can be hard to comprehend.

00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:55.372
Consider the fact that Google processes

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:59.157
over one billion search queries every day,

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:01.325
that every minute, over 100 hours

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.525
of footage are uploaded to YouTube.

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.292
That's more in a single day

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:08.042
than all three major U.S. networks broadcast

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:11.317
in the last five years combined.

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:13.621
And Facebook transmitting the photos,

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:14.817
messages and stories

00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:17.989
of over 1.23 billion people.

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.733
That's almost half of the Internet population,

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.405
and a sixth of humanity.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:24.419
These are some of the products

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:27.173
that I've helped design over the course of my career,

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:29.293
and their scale is so massive

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:31.181
that they've produced unprecedented

00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:33.027
design challenges.

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.389
But what is really hard

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.120
about designing at scale is this:

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.956
It's hard in part because

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:42.861
it requires a combination of two things,

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:45.638
audacity and humility â€”

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.482
audacity to believe that the thing that you're making

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:52.778
is something that the entire world wants and needs,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.874
and humility to understand that as a designer,

00:01:55.874 --> 00:01:58.314
it's not about you or your portfolio,

00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:00.906
it's about the people that you're designing for,

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:02.802
and how your work just might help them

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.406
live better lives.

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:07.027
Now, unfortunately, there's no school

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:11.120
that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.692
I and the other designers

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:14.436
who work on these kinds of products

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:17.788
have had to invent it as we go along,

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:19.405
and we are teaching ourselves

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.273
the emerging best practices

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.253
of designing at scale,

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:25.205
and today I'd like share some of the things

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:27.285
that we've learned over the years.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.516
Now, the first thing that you need to know

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.646
about designing at scale

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:32.620
is that the little things really matter.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.557
Here's a really good example of how

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:38.060
a very tiny design element can make a big impact.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.140
The team at Facebook that manages

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.248
the Facebook "Like" button

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:45.720
decided that it needed to be redesigned.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.147
The button had kind of gotten out of sync

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:49.596
with the evolution of our brand

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:51.384
and it needed to be modernized.

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.252
Now you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,

00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.245
it probably is a pretty straightforward,

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:58.260
easy design assignment, but it wasn't.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.381
Turns out, there were all kinds of constraints

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:02.190
for the design of this button.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.645
You had to work within specific
height and width parameters.

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.940
You had to be careful to make it work

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.701
in a bunch of different languages,

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.756
and be careful about using
fancy gradients or borders

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.900
because it has to degrade gracefully

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.653
in old web browsers.

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:19.325
The truth is, designing this tiny little button

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.508
was a huge pain in the butt.

00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:23.560
Now, this is the new version of the button,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.074
and the designer who led this project estimates

00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:29.588
that he spent over 280 hours

00:03:29.588 --> 00:03:33.238
redesigning this button over the course of months.

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.582
Now, why would we spend so much time

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.886
on something so small?

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.502
It's because when you're designing at scale,

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:42.631
there's no such thing as a small detail.

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:44.147
This innocent little button

00:03:44.147 --> 00:03:48.102
is seen on average 22 billion times a day

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:51.602
and on over 7.5 million websites.

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:55.686
It's one of the single most viewed
design elements ever created.

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:58.190
Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.910
and the designer behind it,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.438
but with these kinds of products,

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:04.174
you need to get even the tiny things right.

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:06.710
Now, the next thing that you need to understand

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.198
is how to design with data.

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:10.870
Now, when you're working on products like this,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.615
you have incredible amounts of information

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.703
about how people are using your product

00:04:15.703 --> 00:04:17.358
that you can then use to influence

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:18.942
your design decisions,

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:21.694
but it's not just as simple as following the numbers.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.945
Let me give you an example

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.110
so that you can understand what I mean.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.267
Facebook has had a tool for a long time

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.580
that allowed people to report photos

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.442
that may be in violation of our community standards,

00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:34.862
things like spam and abuse.

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:36.870
And there were a ton of photos reported,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.506
but as it turns out,

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.402
only a small percentage were actually

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:43.320
in violation of those community standards.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.830
Most of them were just your typical party photo.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.738
Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example,

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:51.234
let's say my friend Laura hypothetically

00:04:51.234 --> 00:04:52.892
uploads a picture of me

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.880
from a drunken night of karaoke.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.146
This is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:00.641
(Laughter)

00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:02.410
Now, incidentally,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.700
you know how some people are kind of worried

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.343
that their boss or employee

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.350
is going to discover embarrassing photos of them

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.890
on Facebook?

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.826
Do you know how hard that is to avoid

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.080
when you actually work at Facebook?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.366
So anyway, there are lots of these photos

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:19.800
being erroneously reported as spam and abuse,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.249
and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.376
He really thought there was something else going on

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:25.532
and he was right,

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:27.856
because when he looked
through a bunch of the cases,

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:29.456
he found that most of them

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.331
were from people who were requesting

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.153
the takedown of a photo of themselves.

00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:36.193
Now this was a scenario that the team

00:05:36.193 --> 00:05:38.560
never even took into account before.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.369
So they added a new feature

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.513
that allowed people to message their friend

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:44.785
to ask them to take the photo down.

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.244
But it didn't work.

00:05:46.244 --> 00:05:47.495
Only 20 percent of people

00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:49.713
sent the message to their friend.

00:05:49.713 --> 00:05:51.964
So the team went back at it.

00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:55.155
They consulted with experts in conflict resolution.

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:58.217
They even studied the universal principles

00:05:58.217 --> 00:05:59.704
of polite language,

00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:01.239
which I didn't even actually know existed

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:03.176
until this research happened.

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:05.705
And they found something really interesting.

00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:07.888
They had to go beyond just helping people

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.800
ask their friend to take the photo down.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.529
They had to help people express to their friend

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.960
how the photo made them feel.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.158
Here's how the experience works today.

00:06:17.158 --> 00:06:20.385
So I find this hypothetical photo of myself,

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:23.014
and it's not spam, it's not abuse,

00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:25.537
but I really wish it weren't on the site.

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:28.761
So I report it and I say,

00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.801
"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,"

00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:34.063
and then we dig deeper.

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:36.569
Why don't you like this photo of yourself?

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.416
And I select "It's embarrassing."

00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:42.742
And then I'm encouraged to message my friend,

00:06:42.742 --> 00:06:44.601
but here's the critical difference.

00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:48.233
I'm provided specific suggested language

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:50.569
that helps me communicate to Laura

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.504
how the photo makes me feel.

00:06:52.504 --> 00:06:55.545
Now the team found that this relatively small change

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:57.224
had a huge impact.

00:06:57.224 --> 00:06:59.624
Before, only 20 percent of people

00:06:59.624 --> 00:07:00.795
were sending the message,

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.840
and now 60 percent were,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.474
and surveys showed that people

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:06.402
on both sides of the conversation

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:08.042
felt better as a result.

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:09.697
That same survey showed

00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:12.050
that 90 percent of your friends

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.788
want to know if they've done something to upset you.

00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:16.885
Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are,

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:18.659
but maybe that's where our "Unfriend" feature

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.220
can come in handy.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.994
So as you can see,

00:07:21.994 --> 00:07:24.602
these decisions are highly nuanced.

00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:26.571
Of course we use a lot of data

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.882
to inform our decisions,

00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:31.325
but we also rely very heavily on iteration,

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:35.449
research, testing, intuition, human empathy.

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.295
It's both art and science.

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:39.861
Now, sometimes the designers
who work on these products

00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:41.549
are called "data-driven,"

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:44.290
which is a term that totally drives us bonkers.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.189
The fact is, it would be irresponsible of us

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:49.741
not to rigorously test our designs

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:51.827
when so many people are counting on us

00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:53.020
to get it right,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.340
but data analytics

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.442
will never be a substitute for design intuition.

00:07:58.442 --> 00:08:01.610
Data can help you make a good design great,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.234
but it will never made a bad design good.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.346
The next thing that you need
to understand as a principle

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:09.893
is that when you introduce change,

00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:12.499
you need to do it extraordinarily carefully.

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:14.166
Now I often have joked that

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.404
I spend almost as much time

00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:18.218
designing the introduction of change

00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:20.418
as I do the change itself,

00:08:20.418 --> 00:08:22.714
and I'm sure that we can all relate to that

00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:24.754
when something that we use a lot changes

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.986
and then we have to adjust.

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.190
The fact is, people can become

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.130
very efficient at using bad design,

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.802
and so even if the change is
good for them in the long run,

00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:37.859
it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,

00:08:37.859 --> 00:08:39.666
and this is particularly true

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:42.362
with user-generated content platforms,

00:08:42.362 --> 00:08:45.803
because people can rightfully
claim a sense of ownership.

00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:49.406
It is, after all, their content.

00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:51.773
Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,

00:08:51.773 --> 00:08:53.968
we were looking for ways to

00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:56.244
encourage more people to rate videos,

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.970
and it was interesting because
when we looked into the data,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.429
we found that almost everyone was exclusively using

00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:04.396
the highest five-star rating,

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:05.980
a handful of people were using

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.656
the lowest one-star,

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:09.075
and virtually no one

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:11.405
was using two, three or four stars.

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.300
So we decided to simplify

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.624
into an up-down kind of voting binary model.

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:19.620
It's going to be much easier
for people to engage with.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.172
But people were very attached

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:23.965
to the five-star rating system.

00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:26.396
Video creators really loved their ratings.

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:27.618
Millions and millions of people

00:09:27.618 --> 00:09:29.781
were accustomed to the old design.

00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.716
So in order to help people

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:33.420
prepare themselves for change

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.653
and acclimate to the new design more quickly,

00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:38.116
we actually published the data graph

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:39.836
sharing with the community

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:41.984
the rationale for what we were going to do,

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:44.605
and it even engaged the larger industry

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:46.070
in a conversation, which resulted in

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.148
my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:52.612
"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:

00:09:52.612 --> 00:09:55.640
Its Ratings Are Useless."

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.295
Now, it's impossible to completely avoid

00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.795
change aversion when you're making changes

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:02.923
to products that so many people use.

00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:04.530
Even though we tried to do all the right things,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.763
we still received our customary flood

00:10:06.763 --> 00:10:09.387
of video protests and angry emails

00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:13.635
and even a package that had
to be scanned by security,

00:10:13.635 --> 00:10:15.595
but we have to remember

00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:18.435
people care intensely about this stuff,

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:21.373
and it's because these products, this work,

00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:23.593
really, really matters to them.

00:10:23.593 --> 00:10:26.900
Now, we know that we have to be careful

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.890
about paying attention to the details,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.363
we have to be cognizant about how we use data

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:33.035
in our design process,

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:34.840
and we have to introduce change

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.531
very, very carefully.

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:38.627
Now, these things are all really useful.

00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:41.739
They're good best practices for designing at scale.

00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:43.531
But they don't mean anything

00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:45.203
if you don't understand something

00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:46.865
much more fundamental.

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:51.626
You have to understand who you are designing for.

00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:53.363
Now, when you set a goal to design

00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:55.229
for the entire human race,

00:10:55.229 --> 00:10:58.283
and you start to engage in that goal in earnest,

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.707
at some point you run into the walls

00:11:00.707 --> 00:11:02.755
of the bubble that you're living in.

00:11:02.755 --> 00:11:05.395
Now, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:06.979
when we hit a dead cell zone

00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:08.628
because we can't use our phones to navigate

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:11.123
to the new hipster coffee shop.

00:11:11.123 --> 00:11:14.277
But what if you had to drive four hours

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:15.613
to charge your phone

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:18.854
because you had no reliable source of electricity?

00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:22.309
What if you had no access to public libraries?

00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:25.133
What if your country had no free press?

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:28.873
What would these products start to mean to you?

00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:31.617
This is what Google, YouTube and Facebook

00:11:31.617 --> 00:11:33.336
look like to most of the world,

00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:34.394
and it's what they'll look like

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:36.496
to most of the next five billion people

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.056
to come online.

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:40.322
Designing for low-end cell phones

00:11:40.322 --> 00:11:42.689
is not glamorous design work,

00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:44.601
but if you want to design for the whole world,

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.712
you have to design for where people are,

00:11:46.712 --> 00:11:48.465
and not where you are.

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:51.632
So how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?

00:11:51.632 --> 00:11:54.716
We try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:57.291
and understand the people we're designing for.

00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:59.667
We use our products in non-English languages

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.820
to make sure that they work just as well.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.955
And we try to use one of these
phones from time to time

00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:07.891
to keep in touch with their reality.

00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:12.168
So what does it mean to design at a global scale?

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:15.582
It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work

00:12:15.582 --> 00:12:19.554
to try to improve and evolve products.

00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:22.747
Finding the audacity and the
humility to do right by them

00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:24.110
can be pretty exhausting,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.622
and the humility part,

00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:27.826
it's a little tough on the design ego.

00:12:27.826 --> 00:12:30.298
Because these products are always changing,

00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:32.810
everything that I've designed in my career

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.106
is pretty much gone,

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:37.386
and everything that I will design will fade away.

00:12:37.386 --> 00:12:39.162
But here's what remains:

00:12:39.162 --> 00:12:41.114
the never-ending thrill

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:43.962
of being a part of something that is so big,

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:46.695
you can hardly get your head around it,

00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:49.592
and the promise that it just might change the world.

00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:51.990
Thank you.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.961
(Applause)
