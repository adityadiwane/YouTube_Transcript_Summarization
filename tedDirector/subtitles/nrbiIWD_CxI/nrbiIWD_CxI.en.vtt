00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My search is always to find ways to chronicle,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but that are never sentimental,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that never look away from the darkest things about us.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
than when we're most ugly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with a whole generation -- in the '80s --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But what I've come to learn

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
everyday acts of compassion.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
my humanity back at me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and send emails and make notes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So what Ubuntu really says

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is that there is no way for us to be human without other people.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's really very simple, but really very complicated.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, I thought I should start with some stories.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so I thought I'd start with my mother.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
(Laughter)

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And she was dark, too.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
My mother was English.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Laughter)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then we went to a fish restaurant,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and he came up and my mother said,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"Do you have any specials, young man?"

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's totally rad."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And my mother turned to me and said,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"What language is he speaking?"

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I said, "English, mum."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And she shook her head and said,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
why don't they use it?"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to Catholicism when she married my father --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
particularly among Igbo women,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the Billings ovulation method,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But her Igbo wasn't too good.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So she took me along to translate.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I was seven.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, here are these women,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
who never discuss their period with their husbands,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
(Laughter)

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And, "Do you notice any discharges?"

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Laughter)

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And, "How swollen is your vulva?"

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Laughter)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
my mother, but she always used to say,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
"Anything a man can do, I can fix."

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Applause)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And when my father complained about this situation,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
where she's taking a seven-year-old boy

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to teach this birth control, you know,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
you're teaching him how to be a woman."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
My mother said, "Someone has to."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This woman -- during the Biafran war,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we were caught in the war.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was my mother with five little children.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and make him a boy soldier.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
All through that one year,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
my mother never cried one time, not once.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
about to fly to England,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
with five really hungry-looking kids,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
came over and asked her what had happened.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And she told this woman.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And so this woman emptied out her suitcase

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
(Laughter) --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that was the only time she cried.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
will unstitch you."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
memorized the names of every dead person,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
into the rice.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But when it came for harvest time,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
they would sing these joyful songs,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that were made up of the names of every child

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
who had been born that year.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
they would remove as many names of the dead

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that equaled as many people that were born.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
beautiful transformation.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the word for rape and the word for marriage

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
was the same one?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Did you also know that after apartheid,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
when the new government went into the parliament houses,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
there were no female toilets in the building?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
was entirely the business of men.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
women are never really counted.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
When I was growing up in Nigeria --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there were always rites of passage for young men.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that's essentially what it is.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
progressing along, so when I turned 13 --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
somebody had to kill the animals,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but I had to do it.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I was supposed to do this alone.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
who was significantly older than me,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
decided to come with me.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Which sort of made me feel good,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
because he'd seen a lot of things.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
stories about how he used to bayonet people,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So, this guy comes with me.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
they sound like human beings,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
until we started keeping goats.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
while I kill the goat.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
such a quotidian experience,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
still found it in himself to try to protect me.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I was a wimp.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I cried for a very long time.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And afterwards, he didn't say a word.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then afterwards he said to me,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
you will die of heartbreak.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Just know that it is enough sometimes

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to know that it is difficult."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and not in good ways.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
(Laughter)

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So, I was born two days after Christmas.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and we had the Catholic priest over,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
my mother was entertaining him with tea.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
so he summoned me up, and he said,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It's your birthday present."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but I found an inflatable sheep.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
(Laughter)

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
my finger where it shouldn't have been,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I was waving this buzzing sheep around,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
(Laughter)

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Applause)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
My last days in prison, the last 18 months,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
my cellmate was 14 years old.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
The name was John James,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the military would hold you as ransom

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
till your family turned themselves in.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
There were some really bad people there.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
"Spiderman" and "X-Men."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
He was obsessed.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And when he got tired of reading them,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
he started to teach the men in death row how to read,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
with these comic books.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And so, I remember night after night,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
huddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
(Laughter)

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It's incredible.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I was really worried.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
He didn't know what death row meant.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I'd been there twice,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And he would always laugh, and say,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
"Come on, man, we'll make it out."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Then I'd say, "How do you know?"

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They killed him.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They handcuffed him to a chair,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
then left him there to bleed to death.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They would come together as a community,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and they would express a wish.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And their wish would then be brought to a priest,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
who would find a ritual object,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and the shrine would be built for the god.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
the Igbos would destroy the god.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
They would knock down the shrine,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and they would stop saying the god's name.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Every day, all of us here,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
we're building gods that have gone rampant,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and it's time we started knocking them down

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and forgetting their names.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It doesn't require a tremendous thing.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
like the ones I've told you.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
There are some of you in this room, amazing people,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
who is in the audience here somewhere.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
"Libation,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
North Carolina, 1999.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I offer to this ground, this gin.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I imagine an old man crying here,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
out of the sight of the overseer.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
He pushes his tongue through a hole

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
where his tooth would be, if he were whole.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It aches in that space where his tooth would be,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
where his land would be,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
He wipes sorrow from his face,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and tastes the salt.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I call a name that could be his.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
This is for you, old man.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
This gin, this salty earth."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Thank you.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Applause)
