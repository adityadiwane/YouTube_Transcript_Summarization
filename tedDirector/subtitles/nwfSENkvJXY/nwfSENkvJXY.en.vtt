00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're entering a second generation of no progress

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to go out and continue this very important thing

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that we as a species have always done.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And that is, instinctively we've gone out

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I feel very strongly

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of a cell phone with a video in it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and help us survive in the future.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
(Laughter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What we're looking forward to is --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Applause)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
what we're looking forward to

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is not only the inspiration of our children,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is that right back to where we inspire people

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
who will be our great leaders later.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
What they look at is the most important thing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
when marvelous things happened.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The ones that flew and landed OK

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
because there were no trained pilots

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
who had good flying qualities by definition.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That has not happened at all in space flying.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, who was inspired during that time period?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and they've landed it only in the deserts.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
(Laughter)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and the blue line is commercial air transport.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that people could build in their garages.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
which is my company now.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that's kind of cool.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
These things tend to happen every 25 years.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
if the government develops and the government uses it.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
space flights in the world -- the very first year.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
There were only three or four flights in 2003.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with my little group of a couple dozen people

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in order to get to a total of five,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
which was the number the same year back in 1961.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This is a picture here taken from orbit.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to go out and try that as a small company.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There's another one announced just last week.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is, there is not solutions for adequate safety

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
three governments have been doing this for 45 years,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I can't tell you when this will start,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
(Laughter)

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but the home computer was for games.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
big development, big improvement and capability and so on,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And the inventor is in this audience.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
our communication and, if we let the Google guys

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So fun is defendable.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And in it also brings up another point, right here.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
There's a group of people that have come forward --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
right in this time period.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and it will lead us into the next really big thing

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
There were a couple of examples here.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It went a whole life cycle without competition,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
took out of service. And we're stuck back here

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
with the same kind of capability for military fighters

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
or if you've got a 10-year-old now.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
why do you need something better?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
because we lost the first two milestones.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you can argue that's not a technical loss.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and that was a very strong thing.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
because a Russian space program is starving,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
when the space race was going on,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
when the commercial stuff is offered.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
This little thing says here: five times

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000
what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
will be at a level of about five times as much

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
OK, thank you very much.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
(Applause)
