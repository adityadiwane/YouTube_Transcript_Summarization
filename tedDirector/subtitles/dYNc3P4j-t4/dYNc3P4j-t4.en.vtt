00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:15.444
Let me ask you all a question.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.146
How much weapons-grade nuclear
material do you think it would take

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.929
to level a city the size of San Francisco?

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:25.586
How many of you think
it would be an amount

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.994
about the size of this suitcase?

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:32.851
OK. And how about this minibus?

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:35.480
All right.

00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:38.198
Well actually, under
the right circumstances,

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:43.673
an amount of highly enriched uranium
about the size of your morning latte

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:46.615
would be enough to kill 100,000 people

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:47.865
instantly.

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:52.028
Hundreds of thousands of others
would become horribly ill,

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:55.641
and parts of the city
would be uninhabitable for years,

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.112
if not for decades.

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:00.556
But you can forget that nuclear latte,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.550
because today's nuclear weapons
are hundreds of times more powerful

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:10.246
even than those we dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:16.210
And even a limited nuclear war
involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,

00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:20.386
could lead to the end
of all life on the planet.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.883
So it's really important that you know

00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:29.988
that right now we have
over 15,000 nuclear weapons

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:32.227
in the hands of nine nations.

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.880
And if you live in a city
or near a military facility,

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:39.899
one is likely pointed right at you.

00:01:40.523 --> 00:01:43.414
In fact, if you live in any
of the rural areas

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.920
where nuclear weapons are stored globally,

00:01:45.944 --> 00:01:47.567
one is likely pointed at you.

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:52.670
About 1,800 of these weapons
are on high alert,

00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:56.384
which means they can be launched
within 15 minutes

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.644
of a presidential command.

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:03.795
So I know this is a bummer of an issue,

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.632
and maybe you have that --
what was it? -- psychic fatigue

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.721
that we heard about a little bit earlier.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.048
So I'm going to switch gears
for just a second,

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:13.458
and I'm going to talk
about my imaginary friend,

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:16.268
who I like to think of as Jasmine,

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:17.638
just for a moment.

00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:20.179
Jasmine, at the age of 25,

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:24.558
is part of a generation that is more
politically and socially engaged

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:26.987
than anything we've seen in 50 years.

00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:28.950
She and her friends think of themselves

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:32.223
as change agents
and leaders and activists.

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:35.389
I think of them as Generation Possible.

00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:39.398
They regularly protest
about the issues they care about,

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:42.830
but nuclear weapons are not one of them,
which makes sense,

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:47.052
because Jasmine was born in 1991,
at the end of the Cold War.

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:50.182
So she didn't grow up hearing a lot
about nuclear weapons.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:53.789
She never had to duck and cover
under her desk at school.

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:58.104
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter
is an app in the Android store.

00:02:58.128 --> 00:03:00.823
Nuclear weapons help win games.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.281
And that is really a shame,

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:06.579
because right now, we need
Generation Possible

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:10.894
to help us make some really important
decisions about nuclear weapons.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:17.981
For instance, will we further reduce
our nuclear arsenals globally,

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:20.921
or will we spend billions,

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:23.168
maybe a trillion dollars,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:26.514
to modernize them so they last
throughout the 21st century,

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:29.837
so that by the time Jasmine is my age,
she's talking to her children

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.792
and maybe even her grandchildren

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:34.447
about the threat of nuclear holocaust?

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.004
And if you're paying any attention
at all to cyberthreats,

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:41.995
or, for instance, if you've read
about the Stuxnet virus

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.884
or, for God's sake, if you've ever
had an email account or a Yahoo account

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:47.956
or a phone hacked,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.132
you can imagine the whole new world
of hurt that could be triggered

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:55.321
by modernization in a period
of cyberwarfare.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.161
Now, if you're paying
attention to the money,

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.246
a trillion dollars could go a long way

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.113
to feeding and educating
and employing people,

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:07.872
all of which could reduce the threat
of nuclear war to begin with.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:09.845
So --

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.891
(Applause)

00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:15.368
This is really crucial right now,

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:18.179
because nuclear weapons --
they're vulnerable.

00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:20.861
We have solid evidence

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.775
that terrorists are trying
to get ahold of them.

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.872
Just this last spring,

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:30.602
when four retirees
and two taxi drivers were arrested

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:32.225
in the Republic of Georgia

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.974
for trying to sell nuclear materials
for 200 million dollars,

00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:39.766
they demonstrated that the black market
for this stuff is alive and well.

00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:41.372
And it's really important,

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:45.193
because there have been
dozens of accidents

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:46.498
involving nuclear weapons,

00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:49.563
and I bet most of us have never heard
anything about them.

00:04:49.587 --> 00:04:51.129
Just here in the United States,

00:04:51.153 --> 00:04:54.651
we've dropped nuclear weapons
on the Carolinas twice.

00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:57.529
In one case, one of the bombs,

00:04:57.553 --> 00:04:59.725
which fell out of an Air Force plane,

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:00.948
didn't detonate

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:04.085
because the nuclear core
was stored somewhere else on the plane.

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:08.145
In another case, the weapon
did arm when it hit the ground,

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.340
and five of the switches designed
to keep it from detonating failed.

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:14.602
Luckily, the sixth one didn't.

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.838
But if that's not enough
to get your attention,

00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:22.060
there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.934
That's when Russian radar technicians saw

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.477
what they thought was a US nuclear missile

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.148
streaking towards Russian airspace.

00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:32.892
It later turned out to be
a Norwegian rocket

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.498
collecting data about the northern lights.

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:36.676
But at that time,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.471
Russian President Boris Yeltsin
came within five minutes

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:44.647
of launching a full-scale
retaliatory nuclear attack

00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:46.503
against the United States.

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:52.966
So, most of the world's nuclear nations

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.455
have committed to getting rid
of these weapons of mass destruction.

00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:58.828
But consider this:

00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:03.159
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons,

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:06.620
which is the most widely adopted
arms control treaty in history

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.787
with 190 signatories,

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:14.692
sets no specific date by which
the world's nuclear-armed nations

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.923
will get rid of their nuclear weapons.

00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:20.462
Now, when John F. Kennedy
sent a man to the moon

00:06:20.486 --> 00:06:23.657
and decided to bring him back,
or decided to do both those things,

00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:26.601
he didn't say, "Hey, whenever
you guys get to it."

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:28.632
He gave us a deadline.

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:30.478
He gave us a challenge

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:34.009
that would have been incredible
just a few years earlier.

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:35.535
And with that challenge,

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:38.434
he inspired scientists and marketers,

00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:41.128
astronauts and schoolteachers.

00:06:41.152 --> 00:06:43.185
He gave us a vision.

00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:45.903
But along with that vision,

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:49.471
he also tried to give us -- and most
people don't know this, either --

00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:51.479
he tried to give us a partner

00:06:51.503 --> 00:06:56.924
in the form of our fiercest
Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.

00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:59.982
Because part of Kennedy's vision
for the Apollo program

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:03.793
was that it be a cooperation,
not a competition, with the Soviets.

00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:07.370
And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev,
the Soviet Premier, agreed.

00:07:08.007 --> 00:07:11.323
But before that cooperation
could be realized,

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.018
Kennedy was assassinated,

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:15.391
and that part of the vision was deferred.

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.760
But the promise of joint innovation
between these two nuclear superpowers

00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:23.656
wasn't totally extinguished.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:28.198
Because in 1991, which is the year
that Jasmine was born

00:07:28.222 --> 00:07:30.708
and the Soviet Union fell,

00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:33.505
these two nations engaged in a project

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.086
that genuinely does seem incredible today

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.156
in the truest sense of that word,

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:43.408
which is that the US sent cash
to the Russians when they needed it most,

00:07:43.432 --> 00:07:46.187
to secure loose nuclear materials

00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:49.416
and to employ out-of-work
nuclear scientists.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.143
They worked alongside American scientists
to convert weapons-grade uranium

00:07:56.167 --> 00:08:00.046
into the type of fuel that can be used
for nuclear power instead.

00:08:00.464 --> 00:08:03.473
They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts."

00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:07.338
So the result is that for over 20 years,

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.169
our two nations had a program

00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:14.006
that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs
in the United States

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.236
was essentially fueled
by former Russian warheads.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.301
So, together these two nations
did something truly audacious.

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:27.974
But the good news is,
the global community has the chance

00:08:27.998 --> 00:08:31.000
to do something just as audacious today.

00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:35.424
To get rid of nuclear weapons

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.986
and to end the supply of the materials
required to produce them,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.702
some experts tell me would take 30 years.

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:45.686
It would take a renaissance of sorts,

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.125
the kinds of innovation that,
for better or worse,

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:52.123
underpinned both the Manhattan Project,
which gave rise to nuclear weapons,

00:08:52.147 --> 00:08:54.559
and the Megatons to Megawatts program.

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:57.641
It would take design constraints.

00:08:57.665 --> 00:09:00.383
These are fundamental to creativity,

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:04.423
things like a platform
for international collaboration;

00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:08.139
a date certain, which is
a forcing mechanism;

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:12.174
and a positive vision
that inspires action.

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:15.198
It would take us to 2045.

00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:20.949
Now, 2045 happens to be
the 100th anniversary

00:09:20.973 --> 00:09:24.247
of the birth of nuclear weapons
in the New Mexico desert.

00:09:25.247 --> 00:09:27.971
But it's also an important date
for another reason.

00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:32.321
It's predicted to be the advent
of the singularity,

00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:35.407
a new moment in human development,

00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:40.551
where the lines between artificial
intelligence and human intelligence blur,

00:09:41.106 --> 00:09:45.535
where computing and consciousness
become almost indistinguishable

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:51.191
and advanced technologies help us solve
the 21st century's greatest problems:

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:53.547
hunger, energy, poverty,

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:57.418
ushering in an era of abundance.

00:09:58.318 --> 00:09:59.900
And we all get to go to space

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.783
on our way to becoming
a multi-planetary species.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:07.891
Now, the people who really believe
this vision are the first to say

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.938
they don't yet know precisely
how we're going to get there.

00:10:11.618 --> 00:10:14.410
But the values behind their vision

00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:17.765
and the willingness to ask "How might we?"

00:10:17.789 --> 00:10:20.290
have inspired a generation of innovators.

00:10:20.884 --> 00:10:24.356
They're working backward
from the outcomes they want,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.584
using the creative problem-solving methods
of collaborative design.

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:30.848
They're busting through obstacles.

00:10:30.872 --> 00:10:34.586
They're redefining
what we all consider possible.

00:10:35.513 --> 00:10:36.721
But here's the thing:

00:10:37.706 --> 00:10:41.916
that vision of abundance isn't compatible

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.145
with a world that still relies
on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:51.730
called "mutually assured destruction."

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:58.422
It has to be about building
the foundations for the 22nd century.

00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:04.252
It has to be about strategies
for mutually assured prosperity

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:08.256
or, at the very least,
mutually assured survival.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:14.398
Now, every day, I get to meet
people who are real pioneers

00:11:14.422 --> 00:11:16.339
in the field of nuclear threats.

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.864
As you can see, many of them
are young women,

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.464
and they're doing fiercely
interesting stuff,

00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:26.991
like Mareena Robinson Snowden here,
who is developing new ways,

00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:29.677
better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,

00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:31.924
which will help us
overcome a critical hurdle

00:11:31.948 --> 00:11:33.882
to international disarmament.

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:36.775
Or Melissa Hanham, who is using
satellite imaging

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:40.904
to make sense of what's going on
around far-flung nuclear sites.

00:11:41.358 --> 00:11:44.055
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:48.352
who has been campaigning
to make nuclear weapons illegal

00:11:48.376 --> 00:11:50.060
in international courts of law,

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.976
and just won a big victory
at the UN last week.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.178
(Applause)

00:11:56.202 --> 00:11:57.416
And yet,

00:11:57.942 --> 00:11:59.131
and yet,

00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:03.215
with all of our talk in this culture
about moon shots,

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:07.967
too few members of Generation Possible
and those of us who mentor them

00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:09.957
are taking on nuclear weapons.

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:12.461
It's as if there's a taboo.

00:12:13.898 --> 00:12:18.573
But I remember something Kennedy said
that has really stuck with me,

00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:20.355
and that is something to the effect

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.521
that humans can be as big as the solutions

00:12:22.545 --> 00:12:24.403
to all the problems we've created.

00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:27.661
No problem of human destiny, he said,

00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:30.330
is beyond human beings.

00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:32.679
I believe that.

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:35.644
And I bet a lot of you here
believe that, too.

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.162
And I know Generation
Possible believes it.

00:12:40.646 --> 00:12:43.865
So it's time to commit to a date.

00:12:45.183 --> 00:12:48.711
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:51.920
on the 100th anniversary of its inception.

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:57.845
After all, by 2045, we will have held
billions of people hostage

00:12:57.869 --> 00:13:00.143
to the threat of nuclear annihilation.

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:02.433
Surely, 100 years will have been enough.

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:07.191
Surely, a century of economic development

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:10.610
and the development of military strategy

00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:14.298
will have given us better ways
to manage global conflict.

00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:18.933
Surely, if ever there was a global
moon shot worth supporting,

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.941
this is it.

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:24.460
Now, in the face of real threats --

00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:27.480
for instance, North Korea's recent
nuclear weapons tests,

00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:29.784
which fly in the face of sanctions --

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:32.108
reasonable people disagree

00:13:32.132 --> 00:13:36.031
about whether we should maintain
some number of nuclear weapons

00:13:36.055 --> 00:13:37.582
to deter aggression.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.454
But the question is:
What's the magic number?

00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:43.601
Is it a thousand?

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.621
Is it a hundred? Ten?

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:48.673
And then we have to ask:

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.352
Who should be responsible for them?

00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:53.896
I think we can agree, however,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.969
that having 15,000 of them
represents a greater global threat

00:13:57.993 --> 00:14:00.374
to Jasmine's generation than a promise.

00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:04.342
So it's time we make a promise

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:07.079
of a world in which we've broken
the stranglehold

00:14:07.103 --> 00:14:10.601
that nuclear weapons have
on our imaginations;

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:13.237
in which we invest
in the creative solutions

00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:16.991
that come from working backward
from the future we desperately want,

00:14:17.015 --> 00:14:19.549
rather than plodding forward
from a present

00:14:19.573 --> 00:14:23.933
that brings all of the mental models
and biases of the past with it.

00:14:24.392 --> 00:14:29.694
It's time we pledge our resources
as leaders across the spectrum

00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:32.607
to work on this old problem in new ways,

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:35.231
to ask, "How might we?"

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.304
How might we make good on a promise

00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:41.905
of greater security
for Jasmine's generation

00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:44.894
in a world beyond nuclear weapons?

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:48.869
I truly hope you will join us.

00:14:49.782 --> 00:14:50.945
Thank you.

00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:54.271
(Applause)

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:55.968
Thank you.

00:14:55.992 --> 00:14:58.142
(Applause)
