00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
She's an Italian fashion designer.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
She goes to this vintage store in Paris

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
with a friend of hers.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
she loves it.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
She's turning it inside out.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Her friend says, "Buy it already."

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Now, the academics in this audience may think,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
But to a fashionista, what it really is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
is a sign of Prada's genius:

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
that she can root through the history of fashion

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
and pick the one jacket

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
that doesn't need to be changed by one iota,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
and to be current and to be now.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
You might also be asking whether it's possible

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
that this is illegal for her to do this.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
In the fashion industry, there's very little

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
intellectual property protection.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
They have trademark protection,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
but no copyright protection

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and no patent protection to speak of.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
All they have, really, is trademark protection,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and so it means that anybody

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
could copy any garment

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
on any person in this room

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and sell it as their own design.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
The only thing that they can't copy

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
is the actual trademark label

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
within that piece of apparel.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
That's one reason that you see logos

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
splattered all over these products.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.260
to knock off these designs

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
because they can't knock off the logo.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
(Laughter) Well, yeah.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Canal Street, I know.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And sometimes these are fun, right?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
doesn't have any copyright protection

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
is because the courts decided long ago

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
that apparel is too utilitarian

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
to qualify for copyright protection.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
They didn't want a handful of designers

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
because Joe Blow owns it.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
This is Vivienne Westwood. No!

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
We think of it as maybe too silly,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
too unnecessary.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
behind copyright protection --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
might be really surprised

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
by both the critical success of the fashion industry

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and the economic success of this industry.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
What I'm going to argue today is that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
because there's no copyright protection

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
in the fashion industry,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
fashion designers have actually been able to elevate

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
utilitarian design,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
things to cover our naked bodies,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
into something that we consider art.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Because there's no copyright protection

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
in this industry,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
there's a very open and creative

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
ecology of creativity.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Unlike their creative brothers and sisters,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
who are sculptors or photographers

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
or filmmakers or musicians,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
fashion designers can sample

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
from all their peers' designs.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
They can take any element from any garment

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
from the history of fashion

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and incorporate it into their own design.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
And here, I suspect,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Maybe just a little.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Can't copyright a costume either.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
Now, fashion designers have

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
the broadest palette imaginable

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
in this creative industry.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
This wedding dress here

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
is actually made of sporks,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
and this dress is actually made of aluminum.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
as they walk through.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
So, one of the magical side effects

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
of having a culture of copying,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
which is really what it is,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is the establishment of trends.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Some people believe that

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
but if you talk to any designer at any level,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
including these high-end designers,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
they always say

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
their main inspiration comes from the street:

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
where people like you and me remix and match

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
our own fashion looks.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
And that's where they really get a lot of their

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
creative inspiration,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
Now, the fast fashion giants have

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
probably benefited the most

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
and selling them at very low prices.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
any more intellectual property protection."

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
When you look at copies like this,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
remain in business?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
We invited Tom Ford to come --

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
the conference was called, "Ready to Share:

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and we asked him exactly this question.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
Here's what he had to say.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
in case you didn't know.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.260
Tom Ford: And we found after much research

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
that -- actually not much research, quite simple research --

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Johanna Blakley: Imagine that.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
The people on Santee Alley

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
are not the ones who shop at Gucci.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
(Laughter)

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
This is a very different demographic.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
as an original high-end design,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
But even sometimes a cheaper version

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
can actually have some charming aspects,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
There's lots of virtues of copying.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
is that we now have

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
a much broader palette

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260
of design choices to choose from than we ever have before,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Fashion, whether you like it or not,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
helps you project who you are to the world.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
Because of fast fashion,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
they want trends to be set

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.260
so that they can move product.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
For fashionistas,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
they want to stay ahead of the curve.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
And so, they want to move on to the next trend

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.260
as soon as possible.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
Every season, these designers have to struggle

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And this, let me tell you,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
is very good for the bottom line.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
that this culture of copying has

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
on the creative process.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
He has complained a lot about people copying him,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
but in one interview I read,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260
he said it has really forced him to up his game.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.260
He had to come up with new ideas,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
new things that would be hard to copy.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.260
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
that has to be made out of steel or titanium;

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
it'll actually crack in two.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And that actually reminded me

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
of jazz great, Charlie Parker.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
was that he was pretty sure

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.260
that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
They're trying to put together

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
a signature look, an aesthetic

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
that reflects who they are.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
When people knock it off, everybody knows

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
because they've put that look out on the runway,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and it's a coherent aesthetic.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
I love these Gallianos.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter)

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
This is not unlike the world of comedy.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
I don't know if you know that jokes

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.260
also can't be copyright protected.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
So when one-liners were really popular,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
everybody stole them from one another.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
But now, we have a different kind of comic.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
They develop a persona,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
a signature style, much like fashion designers.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And their jokes,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
really only work within that aesthetic.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
If somebody steals a joke

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
from Larry David, for instance,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
it's not as funny.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
Now, the other thing that fashion designers have done

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
to survive in this culture of copying

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
is they've learned how to copy themselves.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
They knock themselves off.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
They make deals with the fast fashion giants

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and they come up with a way to sell their product

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
to a whole new demographic:

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the Santee Alley demographic.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
Now, some fashion designers will say,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
In other countries there is protection

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
for our artful designs."

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
it turns out that the protection that's offered

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
is really ineffectual.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
they have a design law; it protects apparel,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
but the novelty standard is so high,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
it's totally unique.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
And that's sort of like

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
the novelty standard for a U.S. patent,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
which fashion designers never get --

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
rarely get here in the states.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
In the European Union, they went in the other direction.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
Very low novelty standard,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
anybody can register anything.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
and you have a lot of luxury designers there,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
they don't register their garments, generally,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and there's not a lot of litigation.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
cut off three inches from the bottom,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
If you look at the registry, actually,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
a lot of the registered things in the E.U.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
are Nike T-shirts

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
that are almost identical to one another.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
She is the head of

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
the Council of Fashion Designers of America,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
and she has told her constituency that

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.260
she is going to get copyright protection

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
for fashion designs.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
because they realized it is so hard

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
to tell the difference between a pirated design

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and something that's just part of a global trend.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
Who owns a look?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
That is a very difficult question to answer.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
You know, it's not just the fashion industry

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
that doesn't have copyright protection.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.260
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
including the food industry.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
You cannot copyright a recipe

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
because it's a set of instructions, it's fact,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
and you cannot copyright the look and feel

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
of even the most unique dish.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
Same with automobiles.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.260
you cannot copyright the sculptural design.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.260
It's a utilitarian article, that's why.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
Same with furniture,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
it's too utilitarian.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
no copyright protection.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Hairdos, no copyright protection.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
Open source software, these guys decided

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
they didn't want copyright protection.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
They share their designs.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
Jokes, no copyright protection.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
Fireworks displays,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
the rules of games,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260
the smell of perfume: no.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And some of these industries may seem

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
sort of marginal to you,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
but these are the gross sales

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
for low I.P. industries,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
industries with very little copyright protection,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and there's the gross sales of

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
films and books.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
(Applause)

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
It ain't pretty.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
(Applause)

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
So you talk to people in the fashion industry

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and they're like, "Shhh!

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
Don't tell anybody

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
we can actually steal from each other's designs.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
It's embarrassing."

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
But you know what? It's revolutionary,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
and it's a model that a lot of other industries --

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.260
like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
they might have to think about this.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
are operating in an atmosphere

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.260
where it's as if they don't have any protection,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
and they don't know what to do.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
that didn't have copyright protection,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
so I made one.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.260
These are the two main

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260
It is more complex than this, but this will do.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
First: Is something an artistic object?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
Then it deserves protection.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Is it a utilitarian object?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Then no, it does not deserve protection.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
This is a difficult, unstable binary.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
The other one is: Is it an idea?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
Is it something that needs to

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.260
freely circulate in a free society?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
No protection.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Or is it a physically fixed

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
expression of an idea:

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
something that somebody made

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260
and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
The problem is that digital technology

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
has completely subverted the logic

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
of this physically fixed, expression

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260
versus idea concept.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
Nowadays,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
we don't really recognize a book

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
as something that sits on our shelf

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
or music as something that is

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
a physical object that we can hold.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
It's a digital file.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
It is barely tethered to any sort of

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
physical reality in our minds.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
actually circulate within our culture

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
a lot more like ideas

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
than like physically instantiated objects.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
when you talk about creativity

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and ownership

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
They're smart.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
He's smart, he's smart.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
hashing this out,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.260
trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
in a digital world,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
that's going to lead to the most innovation?

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
And my suggestion is that

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
fashion might be a really good place

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
to start looking for a model

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
for creative industries in the future.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.260
If you want more information about this research project,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
please visit our website: it's ReadyToShare.org.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
for making this very fashionable presentation.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
Thank you so much. (Applause)
