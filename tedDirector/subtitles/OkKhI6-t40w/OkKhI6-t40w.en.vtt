00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
is that all of the other speakers

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
have said exactly what I wanted to say.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
(Laughter)

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
is to thank you all for your kindness.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
TD: But maybe in the spirit

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
of appreciating the kindness of you all,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
I could share with you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
a little story about myself.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
TD: From the time I was very young, onward,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I was given

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
a lot of different responsibilities,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and it always seemed to me, when I was young,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
that everything was laid out before me.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
All of the plans for me were already made.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
and told where I needed to be,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
given these very precious

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and holy looking robes to wear,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
with the understanding

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
that it was something sacred or important.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
And when I was seven years old,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
all of a sudden,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
a search party arrived at my home.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
They were looking the next Karmapa,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
and the news came to me that they were telling me

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
that I was the Karmapa.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
And these days, people ask me a lot,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
how did that feel.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and your lifestyle completely changed?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
And what I mostly say is that,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
at that time,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
it was a pretty interesting idea to me.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
I thought that things would be pretty fun

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and there would be more things to play with.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
as I thought it would have been.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
I was placed

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
in a pretty strictly controlled environment.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
And immediately,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
a lot of different responsibilities,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
I was separated, largely, from my family,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
including my mother and father.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
I didn't have have many personal friends

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
to spend time with,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
but I was expected to perform

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
these prescribed duties.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
So it turned out that my fantasy

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
wasn't going to come true.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
It more felt to be the case to me

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
that I was being treated like a statue,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
and I was to sit in one place

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
like a statue would.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
even though I've been separated from my loved ones --

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
and, of course, now I'm even further away.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
and became even further removed

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
from my mother and father,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
my relatives, my friends

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and my homeland.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
But nevertheless,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.260
in terms of the love that I feel

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
for these people.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
for all of these people

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and for the land.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
TD: And I still do

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
get to keep in touch with my mother and father,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
albeit infrequently.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
I talk to my mother

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
once in a blue moon on the telephone.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
And my experience is that,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
when I'm talking to her,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
with every second that passes

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
during our conversation,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
the feeling of love that binds us

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
is bringing us closer and closer together.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
TD: So those were just a few remarks

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
about my personal background.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
in terms of ideas,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
where so many people from different backgrounds and places

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
can come together,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
exchange their ideas

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
and form relationships of friendship with each other.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
And I think that's symbolic

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
of what we're seeing in the world in general,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
and that all of the peoples in the world

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
are enjoying more opportunities for connection.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
That's wonderful,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
but we should also remember

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.260
that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Along with outward development

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
and increase of opportunity,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
there should be inward development

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and deepening of our heart connections

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260
as well as our outward connections.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
So we spoke and we heard some

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
about design this week.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
I think that it's important for us to remember

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
that we need

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
to keep pushing forward

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
on the endeavor

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
of the design of the heart.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
We heard a lot about technology this week,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
and it's important for us to remember

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
to invest a lot of our energy

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
in improving the technology of the heart.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.260
TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
still, I feel a sense of impediment,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
when it comes

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
to the ability that we have

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.260
I feel that there are some things

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
that are getting in the way.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
TC: My relationship

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
is an interesting one,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.260
because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
to open my heart to others

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and offer myself up

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
in a genuine way with other people,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
but at the same time,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
I've always been advised

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260
that I need to emphasize intelligence

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
over the heart-to-heart connections,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.260
because, being someone in a position like mine,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
then something dangerous may happen to me.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
So it's an interesting paradox at play there.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.260
But I had a really striking experience once,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
when a group from Afghanistan

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
came to visit me,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
and we had a really interesting conversation.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
which, as you know,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
But the basis of our conversation

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
was the different approach to spirituality

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
on the part of the Muslim

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
and Buddhist traditions.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
Of course, in Muslim,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
you don't find as many

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
physical representations of divinity

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
or of spiritual liberation

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
as you do in the Buddhist tradition,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
that are highly revered.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
So, we were talking about the differences

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
between the traditions

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and what many people perceived

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
but I offered the suggestion

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
was the depletion of matter,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
some solid substance

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
falling down and disintegrating.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
to the falling of the Berlin Wall,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
where a divide

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.260
that had kept two types of people apart

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
had collapsed and opened up a door

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.260
for further communication.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
So I think that, in this way,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
it's always possible for us

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
to derive something positive

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
that can help us understand one another better.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
TD: So, with regard to the development

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260
that we've been talking about

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.260
here at this conference,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.260
I really feel

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.260
that the development that we make

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
shouldn't create a further burden

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
for us as human beings,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
but should be used

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
to improve

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
our fundamental lifestyle

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
of how we live in the world.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
TD: Of course, I rejoice

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.260
in the development and the growth and the rise

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
of the noble land of India, the great country of India,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
but at the same time, I think,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.260
as some of us have acknowledged,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.260
we need to be aware

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260
that some aspects of this rise

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
are coming at the cost

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.260
of the very ground

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
on which we stand.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
So, as we are climbing the tree,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
some of the things that we're doing

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
in order to climb the tree

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
are actually undermining

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
the tree's very root.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
And so,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.260
what I think it comes down to

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.260
is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260
but paying attention to that

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.260
and letting that shift our motivation

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
to become more sincere

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
and genuinely positive.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
We have hear, this week,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.260
about the horrible sufferings, for example,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260
that so many women of the world

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.260
are enduring day-to-day.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
We have that information,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
but what often happens to us

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.260
is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.260
We don't really choose to allow that

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.260
to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.260
So I think the way forward for the world --

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.260
one that will bring the path of outer development

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.260
in harmony

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.260
with the real root of happiness --

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.260
is that we allow

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.260
the information that we have

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.260
to really make a change in our heart.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
TD: So I think that sincere motivation

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.260
is very important for our future well-being,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.260
or deep sense of well-being as humans,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.260
and I think that means sinking in

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.260
to whatever it is you're doing now.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.260
Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.260
sink into that,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
get a full taste of that.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.260
TD: So, since we've been here this week,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.260
we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.260
and perhaps we haven't witnessed

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.260
any course changes

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
happening in our lives,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.260
but we often miss the very subtle changes.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.260
And I think

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.260
that sometimes we develop

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.260
grand concepts

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.260
of what happiness

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.260
might look like for us,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.260
but that, if we pay attention,

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.260
we can see that there are little symbols of happiness

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.260
in every breath that we take.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.260
TD: So, every one of you who has come here

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.260
is so talented,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.260
and you have so much to offer to the world,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.260
I think it would be a good note to conclude on then

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.260
to just take a moment

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.260
to appreciate how fortunate we are

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.260
to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.260
and really form a strong aspiration

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.260
and energy within ourselves

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.260
that we will take the good

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.260
that has come from this conference,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.260
the momentum, the positivity,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.260
and we will spread that and plant it

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.260
in all of the corners of the world.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.260
His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.260
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.260
even in inviting me,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.260
let alone everything else that she has done

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.260
to make this happen,

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.260
and I was somewhat resistant at times,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.260
and I was also very nervous throughout this week.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.260
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.260
and people would ask me, why.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.260
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.260
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.260
but I very much appreciate

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.260
the opportunity she's given me

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.260
to be here.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.260
And to you, everyone, thank you very much.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.260
(Applause)

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.260
HH: Thank you very much.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.260
(Applause)
