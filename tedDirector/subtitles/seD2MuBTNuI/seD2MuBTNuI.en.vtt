00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.160
I draw to better understand things.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.160
while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.160
spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160
Who knew about extension managers?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
I've always managed my own extensions

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
because along with the invitation

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
but some alternate form of communication would.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
something that would be particularly appropriate

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
for many of the more technically minded people here,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
or I could talk about something I really care about.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
I decided to go with the latter.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm going to talk about Rome.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
in Rome as a student. It changed my life.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.160
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160
driving into RISD everyday, driving back.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.160
I missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter)

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
So, whenever given an opportunity,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
I try to do something in it or with it or for it.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
I also make drawings to help people understand things.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
Things that I want them to believe I understand.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
And that's what I do as an illustrator,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160
that's my job.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160
I need to.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
Part of the reason I'm showing you these

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.160
is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
These are sketches of some of the little details.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Rome is a city full of surprises.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
we're talking about narrow little winding streets

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160
that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas --

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.160
the bits of light that come down between the buildings

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
usually blue -- especially in the summer --

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
compared to the map that you would normally expect to see

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
of conventional streets.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
How could I share my sense of Rome,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
my understanding of Rome?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.160
if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
with any kind of efficiency.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.160
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.160
And here's a line of text that actually evolves

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160
from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Maybe that line of text could be a story

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160
to help give some human aspect to this.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Maybe I should get away from this map completely,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160
and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160
which happens in so many of the squares in the city --

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
But even though I just started this presentation,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
this is not the first thing that I tried to do

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160
and I was getting sort of desperate.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160
so I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter)

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.160
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
But one of the ideas that emerged

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.160
from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
in different vehicles at different speeds in order

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
to show the different aspects of Rome.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
Quick snapshots of things you might see

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.160
some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160
so I could actually use it as a scale

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.160
that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.160
This thing would be flying over or past

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160
sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160
but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.160
with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160
and so on and so forth. If you were interested.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
she's assembling the structure,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.160
and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
Over the Spanish Steps we go.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
Unfortunately, just across the road from it

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.160
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.160
as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.160
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.160
of the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
which is really no more than a pile of quarters

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160
completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.160
a spectacular place to visit.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.160
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
extraordinary blue sky.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.160
and climbs down for a closer look inside.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.160
to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
getting a different kind of perspective,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.160
that can contain perfectly a sphere

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
dimensions of the diameter being the same

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160
around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
and they are immediately yanked out

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
of some of the domes of Rome, which would,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.160
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.160
that little spiral structure you see there.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.160
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.160
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.160
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160
and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160
and then is completely removed

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.160
and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.160
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Ajax makes a lunge for it.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160
She's managed to save the prosciutto,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
but in the process she loses the tablecloth,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.160
which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.160
They continue without their tablecloth,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160
looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.160
They eventually discover a huge wall

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.160
that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.160
because you've got a place to tie up.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Turns out to be the exterior wall --

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160
that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.160
and have a spectacular view.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.160
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.160
through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
and then an abandoned gatehouse

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.160
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.160
which has this lightning rod on top.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
and when you're in a dirigible

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160
you have to be very careful about spikes.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.160
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.160
but he's not due at work until about noon.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.160
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.160
past the church of Santa Maria della Pace,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160
down the alleys, through the streets

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
that tourists may be wandering through,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.160
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.160
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.160
which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
one of which is upside down in this image.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.160
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.160
who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160
in a delicate white wine clam sauce

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160
to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.160
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.160
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.160
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.160
Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.160
because of scaffolding and the determination

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.160
to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.160
to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160
in which it finds itself, or we find it.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160
in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Marcello, as it turns out,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160
is the driver of the number 64 bus,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160
that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160
as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.160
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
He's looking at his table;

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter)

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.160
and he wants it to be perfect.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.160
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.160
and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
But he's not happy; something's wrong.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.160
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.160
but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160
actually; he's in television.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
So they all have his number.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.160
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.160
who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
nobody's TVs are working

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160
and there's a big soccer game coming up,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160
and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.160
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.160
and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.160
apartment by apartment, checking every television,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
checking every connection,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
hoping to find out what this problem is.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.160
and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.160
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.160
wrapped around the building's television antenna.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.160
He removes it, the problems are solved,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.160
everybody in the palazzo is happy.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160
And of course, he also solves his own problem.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.160
All he has to do now, with a perfect table,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.160
is wait for her to arrive.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.160
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.160
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160
and I'll get inside and underneath

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160
and I'll show these things growing

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.160
I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160
and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.160
Now that's one drawing,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter)

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.160
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
and also hope.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.160
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160
that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.160
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
it's a series of layers.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.160
I mean, you always peel one layer off another;

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.160
we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
horizontal layers, vertical layers --

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.160
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
if I got you thinking about it the right way --

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.160
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.160
covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160
as these structures have been adapted

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
rather than being torn down.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.160
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.160
and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.160
You can see that in 1635,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160
it became essential to make smaller windows

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.160
because the bad guys were coming or whatever.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160
But more importantly, I could also show you

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160
what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
with all the massive stone blocks,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.160
which is more often the case.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.160
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160
into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.160
reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160
You wrap the pages around your head

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And I've really not done anything much more complicated

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160
than make foldout pages.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.160
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
Here's a book completely wide open.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.160
if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
And if I turn the book the other way,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
No foldouts, no tricks --

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160
just a book that isn't open the whole way.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160
So we get inside the Pantheon

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.160
and it grows and so on and so forth.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160
but it sort of lost its human quality.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.160
So I went back to the notion of story,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.160
which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.160
to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160
If it was a homing pigeon,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.160
But it was the journey of the ... (Laughter)

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.160
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160
and showed all the things that I like about Rome.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.160
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.160
and there's no way this pigeon can get home.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.160
So it's a homeless pigeon now

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160
and it's going to have to find another place to live,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160
and we start with the tall ones and so on.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160
that's not always a good thing,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160
And I thought, that's sort of interesting,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.160
but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.160
So I kind of came up with this old guy

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.160
and they become really friends with this guy,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160
and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
There's a real bond that develops

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
between this old man and these pigeons.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.160
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.160
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.160
he lives in this little garret --

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160
and they spell his name and fly around.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
And he finally gets enough strength together

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.160
to climb up the ladder onto the roof,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
and they carry him off over the walls of the city.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
And I forgot to mention this:

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
out beyond the walls of the city.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160
In the old Roman custom, the dead

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
were never buried within the walls.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
And I thought that's a really cheery story.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.160
(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.160
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.160
and if the stories aren't going anywhere,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
I just come up with titles

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.160
And sometimes it does focus me enough

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.160
and I'll even do a title page.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.160
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.160
to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
who sends a message on a homing pigeon --

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160
she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
If you see the red line,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160
you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.160
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.160
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
to try to convey what that sense would be like

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160
of flying over the city without actually moving.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
Past the Pyramid of Cestius --

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.160
these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
past the gatehouse.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.160
This is something that's a little bit unusual.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.160
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.160
it takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160
that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.160
beyond about four pages.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:51.160
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.160
and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.160
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.160
designed by Michelangelo,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.160
built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.160
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160
This is one of those things I show to my students

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160
because it's a complete bastardization --

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160
a denial of any rules of perspective.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.160
if it looks believable, you've succeeded.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
a couple are on Mars and

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.160
a couple of others in Cremona.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.160
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160
where invariably a soccer game is going on,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
and we're hit by a soccer ball.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.160
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.160
I have all the pieces:

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.160
so I had to rethink it.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive --

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160
just turn it around and look at it the other way.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.160
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:05.160
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.160
one of the few remaining medieval towers --

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.160
towards the church of Sant'Agnese

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160
and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.160
there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.160
and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.160
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
of the Pantheon to catch our breath.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160
we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.160
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.160
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.160
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.160
beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.160
which is our destination.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
Straight up through the courtyard

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.160
into a little window into the attic,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
where somebody is working at the drawing board.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.160
As we look at the drawing board,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160
we see what he's working on is, in fact,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160
a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160
and the red line extends through all the sights.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.160
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.160
all you have to do is read these paragraphs.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.160
Thank you very much.
