00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.936
I want to talk to you
about the future of medicine.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.056
But before I do that, I want to talk
a little bit about the past.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.696
Now, throughout much
of the recent history of medicine,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.536
we've thought about illness and treatment

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.936
in terms of a profoundly simple model.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.656
In fact, the model is so simple

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.736
that you could summarize it in six words:

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.840
have disease, take pill, kill something.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.816
Now, the reason
for the dominance of this model

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.456
is of course the antibiotic revolution.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.656
Many of you might not know this,
but we happen to be celebrating

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.736
the hundredth year of the introduction
of antibiotics into the United States.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.376
But what you do know

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.640
is that that introduction
was nothing short of transformative.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.736
Here you had a chemical,
either from the natural world

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.496
or artificially synthesized
in the laboratory,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.776
and it would course through your body,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.576
it would find its target,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.256
lock into its target --

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.496
a microbe or some part of a microbe --

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.960
and then turn off a lock and a key

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.496
with exquisite deftness,
exquisite specificity.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.816
And you would end up taking
a previously fatal, lethal disease --

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.976
a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.040
and transforming that
into a curable, or treatable illness.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.560
You have a pneumonia,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.856
you take penicillin,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.416
you kill the microbe

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.576
and you cure the disease.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.536
So seductive was this idea,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.736
so potent the metaphor of lock and key

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.296
and killing something,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.336
that it really swept through biology.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480
It was a transformation like no other.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.336
And we've really spent the last 100 years

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.816
trying to replicate that model
over and over again

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.079
in noninfectious diseases,

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:16.223
in chronic diseases like diabetes
and hypertension and heart disease.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.759
And it's worked,
but it's only worked partly.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.776
Let me show you.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.696
You know, if you take the entire universe

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.216
of all chemical reactions
in the human body,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.536
every chemical reaction
that your body is capable of,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.576
most people think that that number
is on the order of a million.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.896
Let's call it a million.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.616
And now you ask the question,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.296
what number or fraction of reactions

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.136
can actually be targeted

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.976
by the entire pharmacopoeia,
all of medicinal chemistry?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.040
That number is 250.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.216
The rest is chemical darkness.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.416
In other words, 0.025 percent
of all chemical reactions in your body

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.560
are actually targetable
by this lock and key mechanism.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.736
You know, if you think
about human physiology

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.216
as a vast global telephone network

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.120
with interacting nodes
and interacting pieces,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.776
then all of our medicinal chemistry

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.056
is operating on one tiny corner

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.776
at the edge, the outer edge,
of that network.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.616
It's like all of our
pharmaceutical chemistry

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.416
is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.400
who is tinkering with about
10 or 15 telephone lines.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.040
So what do we do about this idea?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.520
What if we reorganized this approach?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.456
In fact, it turns out
that the natural world

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.536
gives us a sense of how one
might think about illness

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.216
in a radically different way,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.960
rather than disease, medicine, target.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.456
In fact, the natural world
is organized hierarchically upwards,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.336
not downwards, but upwards,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.600
and we begin with a self-regulating,
semi-autonomous unit called a cell.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.856
These self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.696
give rise to self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units called organs,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.720
and these organs coalesce
to form things called humans,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.816
and these organisms
ultimately live in environments,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.440
which are partly self-regulating
and partly semi-autonomous.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.736
What's nice about this scheme,
this hierarchical scheme

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.456
building upwards rather than downwards,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.856
is that it allows us
to think about illness as well

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.214
in a somewhat different way.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.520
Take a disease like cancer.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.416
Since the 1950s,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.967
we've tried rather desperately to apply
this lock and key model to cancer.

00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.880
We've tried to kill cells

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:02.252
using a variety of chemotherapies 
or targeted therapies,

00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:04.696
and as most of us know, that's worked.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.578
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.

00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:08.976
It's worked for some forms
of breast cancer,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.736
but eventually you run
to the ceiling of that approach.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.256
And it's only in the last 10 years or so

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.416
that we've begun to think
about using the immune system,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.536
remembering that in fact the cancer cell
doesn't grow in a vacuum.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.616
It actually grows in a human organism.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.936
And could you use the organismal capacity,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.103
the fact that human beings
have an immune system, to attack cancer?

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:33.327
In fact, it's led to the some of the most
spectacular new medicines in cancer.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.814
And finally there's the level
of the environment, isn't there?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.136
You know, we don't think of cancer
as altering the environment.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.056
But let me give you an example
of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.280
It's called a prison.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.296
You take loneliness, you take depression,
you take confinement,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.520
and you add to that,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.960
rolled up in a little
white sheet of paper,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.776
one of the most potent neurostimulants
that we know, called nicotine,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.736
and you add to that one of the most potent
addictive substances that you know,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.556
and you have
a pro-carcinogenic environment.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.976
But you can have anti-carcinogenic
environments too.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.696
There are attempts to create milieus,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.482
change the hormonal milieu
for breast cancer, for instance.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.856
We're trying to change the metabolic
milieu for other forms of cancer.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.296
Or take another disease, like depression.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.976
Again, working upwards,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.016
since the 1960s and 1970s,
we've tried, again, desperately

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.216
to turn off molecules
that operate between nerve cells --

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.416
serotonin, dopamine --

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.256
and tried to cure depression that way,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.720
and that's worked,
but then that reached the limit.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.620
And we now know that what you
really probably need to do

00:06:47.644 --> 00:06:50.616
is to change the physiology
of the organ, the brain,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.776
rewire it, remodel it,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.376
and that, of course,
we know study upon study has shown

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.115
that talk therapy does exactly that,

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.395
and study upon study
has shown that talk therapy

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.536
combined with medicines, pills,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.989
really is much more effective
than either one alone.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.416
Can we imagine a more immersive
environment that will change depression?

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.496
Can you lock out the signals
that elicit depression?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.000
Again, moving upwards along this
hierarchical chain of organization.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.456
What's really at stake perhaps here

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.736
is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.816
Rather than killing something,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.536
in the case of the great
chronic degenerative diseases --

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.056
kidney failure, diabetes,
hypertension, osteoarthritis --

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.652
maybe what we really need to do is change
the metaphor to growing something.

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:40.616
And that's the key, perhaps,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.136
to reframing our thinking about medicine.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.616
Now, this idea of changing,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.976
of creating a perceptual
shift, as it were,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.296
came home to me to roost in a very
personal manner about 10 years ago.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.096
About 10 years ago --
I've been a runner most of my life --

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.096
I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.776
I came back and woke up
and I basically couldn't move.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.816
My right knee was swollen up,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.360
and you could hear that ominous crunch
of bone against bone.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.136
And one of the perks of being a physician
is that you get to order your own MRIs.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.136
And I had an MRI the next week,
and it looked like that.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.456
Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage
that is between bone

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.896
had been completely torn
and the bone itself had been shattered.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.376
Now, if you're looking at me
and feeling sorry,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.216
let me tell you a few facts.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.416
If I was to take an MRI
of every person in this audience,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.496
60 percent of you would show signs

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.296
of bone degeneration
and cartilage degeneration like this.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.096
85 percent of all women by the age of 70

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.376
would show moderate to severe
cartilage degeneration.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.696
50 to 60 percent
of the men in this audience

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.056
would also have such signs.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.856
So this is a very common disease.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.976
Well, the second perk of being a physician

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.135
is that you can get
to experiment on your own ailments.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.376
So about 10 years ago we began,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.816
we brought this process
into the laboratory,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.856
and we began to do simple experiments,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.336
mechanically trying
to fix this degeneration.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.176
We tried to inject chemicals
into the knee spaces of animals

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.856
to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.416
and to put a short summary
on a very long and painful process,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.216
essentially it came to naught.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.440
Nothing happened.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.656
And then about seven years ago,
we had a research student from Australia.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.205
The nice thing about Australians

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:28.521
is that they're habitually used to
looking at the world upside down.

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.703
(Laughter)

00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:33.816
And so Dan suggested to me, "You know,
maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.840
Maybe it isn't a chemical problem.
Maybe it's a stem cell problem."

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.656
In other words, he had two hypotheses.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.496
Number one, there is such a thing
as a skeletal stem cell --

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.040
a skeletal stem cell that builds up
the entire vertebrate skeleton,

00:09:49.064 --> 00:09:51.596
bone, cartilage and the fibrous
elements of skeleton,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.485
just like there's a stem cell in blood,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.945
just like there's a stem cell
in the nervous system.

00:09:55.969 --> 00:09:59.529
And two, that maybe that, the degeneration
or dysfunction of this stem cell

00:09:59.554 --> 00:10:03.056
is what's causing osteochondral arthritis,
a very common ailment.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.296
So really the question was,
were we looking for a pill

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.936
when we should have really
been looking for a cell.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.816
So we switched our models,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.960
and now we began
to look for skeletal stem cells.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.056
And to cut again a long story short,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.000
about five years ago,
we found these cells.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.296
They live inside the skeleton.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.216
Here's a schematic and then
a real photograph of one of them.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.176
The white stuff is bone,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.216
and these red columns that you see
and the yellow cells

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.496
are cells that have arisen
from one single skeletal stem cell --

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.816
columns of cartilage, columns of bone
coming out of a single cell.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.136
These cells are fascinating.
They have four properties.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.936
Number one is that they live
where they're expected to live.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.336
They live just underneath
the surface of the bone,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.896
underneath cartilage.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.540
You know, in biology,
it's location, location, location.

00:10:52.564 --> 00:10:56.816
And they move into the appropriate areas
and form bone and cartilage.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.096
That's one.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.656
Here's an interesting property.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.336
You can take them out
of the vertebrate skeleton,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.936
you can culture them
in petri dishes in the laboratory,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.936
and they are dying to form cartilage.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.682
Remember how we couldn't
form cartilage for love or money?

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:11.625
These cells are dying to form cartilage.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.655
They form their own furls
of cartilage around themselves.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.296
They're also, number three,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.496
the most efficient repairers
of fractures that we've ever encountered.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.816
This is a little bone,
a mouse bone that we fractured

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.376
and then let it heal by itself.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.416
These stem cells have come in
and repaired, in yellow, the bone,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.056
in white, the cartilage,
almost completely.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.616
So much so that if you label them
with a fluorescent dye

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.376
you can see them like some kind
of peculiar cellular glue

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.256
coming into the area of a fracture,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.256
fixing it locally
and then stopping their work.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.616
Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.776
and that is that their numbers
decline precipitously,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.496
precipitously, tenfold,
fiftyfold, as you age.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.096
And so what had happened, really,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.976
is that we found ourselves
in a perceptual shift.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.736
We had gone hunting for pills

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.256
but we ended up finding theories.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.496
And in some ways

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.136
we had hooked ourselves
back onto this idea:

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.056
cells, organisms, environments,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.656
because we were now thinking
about bone stem cells,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.120
we were thinking about arthritis
in terms of a cellular disease.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.126
And then the next question was,
are there organs?

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.389
Can you build this
as an organ outside the body?

00:12:22.413 --> 00:12:26.256
Can you implant cartilage
into areas of trauma?

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.256
And perhaps most interestingly,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.656
can you ascend right up
and create environments?

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.736
You know, we know
that exercise remodels bone,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.176
but come on, none of us
is going to exercise.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.376
So could you imagine ways of passively
loading and unloading bone

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.216
so that you can recreate
or regenerate degenerating cartilage?

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.621
And perhaps more interesting,
and more importantly,

00:12:48.645 --> 00:12:52.096
the question is, can you apply this model
more globally outside medicine?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.176
What's at stake, as I said before,
is not killing something,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.640
but growing something.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.096
And it raises a series of, I think,
some of the most interesting questions

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.640
about how we think
about medicine in the future.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.920
Could your medicine
be a cell and not a pill?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.216
How would we grow these cells?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.256
What we would we do to stop
the malignant growth of these cells?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.176
We heard about the problems
of unleashing growth.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.976
Could we implant
suicide genes into these cells

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.440
to stop them from growing?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.976
Could your medicine be an organ
that's created outside the body

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.936
and then implanted into the body?

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.696
Could that stop some of the degeneration?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.625
What if the organ needed to have memory?

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:40.416
In cases of diseases of the nervous system
some of those organs had memory.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.896
How could we implant
those memories back in?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.736
Could we store these organs?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.903
Would each organ have to be developed
for an individual human being

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.127
and put back?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.136
And perhaps most puzzlingly,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.970
could your medicine be an environment?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.816
Could you patent an environment?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.296
You know, in every culture,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.256
shamans have been using
environments as medicines.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.600
Could we imagine that for our future?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.456
I've talked a lot about models.
I began this talk with models.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.176
So let me end with some thoughts
about model building.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.296
That's what we do as scientists.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.616
You know, when an architect
builds a model,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.936
he or she is trying to show you
a world in miniature.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.856
But when a scientist is building a model,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.404
he or she is trying to show you
the world in metaphor.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.456
He or she is trying to create
a new way of seeing.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.600
The former is a scale shift.
The latter is a perceptual shift.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.856
Now, antibiotics created
such a perceptual shift

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.696
in our way of thinking about medicine
that it really colored, distorted,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.640
very successfully, the way we've thought
about medicine for the last hundred years.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.816
But we need new models
to think about medicine in the future.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.320
That's what's at stake.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.816
You know, there's
a popular trope out there

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.816
that the reason we haven't had
the transformative impact

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.816
on the treatment of illness

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.696
is because we don't have
powerful-enough drugs,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.080
and that's partly true.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.616
But perhaps the real reason is

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.840
that we don't have powerful-enough
ways of thinking about medicines.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.976
It's certainly true that

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.776
it would be lovely to have new medicines.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.456
But perhaps what's really at stake
are three more intangible M's:

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.296
mechanisms, models, metaphors.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.656
Thank you.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.520
(Applause)

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.016
Chris Anderson:
I really like this metaphor.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.576
How does it link in?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.736
There's a lot of talk in technologyland

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.896
about the personalization of medicine,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.336
that we have all this data
and that medical treatments of the future

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.856
will be for you specifically,
your genome, your current context.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.816
Does that apply to this model
you've got here?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.456
Siddhartha Mukherjee:
It's a very interesting question.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.696
We've thought about
personalization of medicine

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.256
very much in terms of genomics.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.856
That's because the gene
is such a dominant metaphor,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.856
again, to use that same word,
in medicine today,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.616
that we think the genome will drive
the personalization of medicine.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.736
But of course the genome
is just the bottom

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.576
of a long chain of being, as it were.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.416
That chain of being, really the first
organized unit of that, is the cell.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.416
So, if we are really going to deliver
in medicine in this way,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.256
we have to think of personalizing
cellular therapies,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.456
and then personalizing
organ or organismal therapies,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.296
and ultimately personalizing
immersion therapies for the environment.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.416
So I think at every stage, you know --

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.856
there's that metaphor,
there's turtles all the way.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.261
Well, in this, there's
personalization all the way.

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:58.176
CA: So when you say
medicine could be a cell

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.016
and not a pill,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.296
you're talking about
potentially your own cells.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.696
SM: Absolutely.
CA: So converted to stem cells,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.256
perhaps tested against all kinds
of drugs or something, and prepared.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.816
SM: And there's no perhaps.
This is what we're doing.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.576
This is what's happening,
and in fact, we're slowly moving,

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.415
not away from genomics,
but incorporating genomics

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.175
into what we call multi-order,
semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.816
like cells, like organs,
like environments.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.207
CA: Thank you so much.

00:17:28.227 --> 00:17:29.517
SM: Pleasure. Thanks.
