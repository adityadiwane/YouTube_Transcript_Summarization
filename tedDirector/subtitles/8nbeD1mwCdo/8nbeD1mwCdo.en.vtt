00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.016
When was I was 21 years old,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.840
I had all this physics homework.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.135
Physics homework requires taking breaks,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760
and Wikipedia was relatively new,
so I took a lot of breaks there.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.456
I kept going back to the same articles,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.136
reading them again and again,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.560
on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.856
How cool would it be to visit these places

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.440
and what would it take to do so?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.496
Well, here we are

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.936
on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.616
operated by NASA

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.440
flying over the Greenland ice sheet.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.016
There's a lot to see here,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.816
but there's more that is hidden,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.120
waiting to be uncovered.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.656
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.640
is that there's liquid water
hidden inside the ice sheet,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.204
because we didn't know that yet.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.576
I did learn on Wikipedia
that the Greenland ice sheet is huge,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.896
the size of Mexico,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.320
and its ice from top to bottom
is two miles thick.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.576
But it's not just static.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.040
The ice flows like a river
downhill towards the ocean.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.976
As it flows around bends,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.720
it deforms and cracks.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.296
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.416
which are located in one of the most
remote physical environments

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.880
remaining on earth.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.016
To work in glaciology right now
is like getting in on the ground floor

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.960
at Facebook in the 2000s.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.096
(Laughter)

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.256
Our capability to fly airplanes
and satellites over the ice sheets

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.496
is revolutionizing glaciology.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.456
It's just starting to do for science

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.640
what the smartphone
has done for social media.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.296
The satellites are reporting
a wealth of observations

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.560
that are revealing new hidden facts
about the ice sheets continuously.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.136
For instance, we have observations
of the size of the Greenland ice sheet

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.720
every month going back to 2002.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.696
You can look towards the bottom
of the screen here

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.696
to see the month and the year go forward.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.216
You can see that some areas
of the ice sheet melt

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.000
or lose ice in the summer.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.696
Other areas experience snowfall

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.840
or gain ice back in the winter.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.696
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed
by an overall rate of mass loss

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.600
that would have stunned
a glaciologist 50 years ago.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.680
We never thought that an ice sheet could
lose mass into the ocean this quickly.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.896
Since these measurements began in 2002,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.056
the ice sheet has lost so much ice

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.696
that if that water were piled up
on our smallest continent,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.000
it would drown Australia knee-deep.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.120
How is this possible?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.616
Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.096
We used radar to image the hills,
valleys, mountains and depressions

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.936
that the ice flows over.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.456
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels
the size of the Grand Canyon

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.680
that funnel ice and water
off of Greenland and into the ocean.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.856
The reason that radar
can reveal the bedrock

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.736
is that ice is entirely
transparent to radar.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.296
You can do an experiment.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160
Go home and put
an ice cube in the microwave.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.696
It won't melt,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.816
because microwaves, or radar,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.200
pass straight through the ice
without interacting.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.496
If you want to melt your ice cube,
you have to get it wet,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.216
because water heats up easily
in the microwave.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.576
That's the whole principle
the microwave oven is designed around.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240
Radar can see water.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.816
And radar has revealed
a vast pool of liquid water

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.776
hidden under my colleague Olivia,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.480
seven stories beneath her feet.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.576
Here, she's used a pump

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.816
to bring some of that water
back to the ice sheet's surface.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.600
Just six years ago, we had no idea
this glacier aquifer existed.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.136
The aquifer formed

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.536
when snow melts in the summer sun

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.840
and trickles downward.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.720
It puddles up in huge pools.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.136
From there, the snow acts as an igloo,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.040
insulating this water
from the cold and the wind above.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.616
So the water can stay
hidden in the ice sheet

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.040
in liquid form year after year.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.696
The question is, what happens next?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.456
Does the water stay there forever?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.696
It could.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.360
Or does it find a way out
to reach the global ocean?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.776
One possible way
for the water to reach the bedrock

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.456
and from there the ocean

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.959
is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.176
When cracks fill with water,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.000
the weight of the water
forces them deeper and deeper.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.016
This is how fracking works

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.056
to extract natural gas
from deep within the earth.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.160
Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.880
All it takes is a crack to get started.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.176
Well, we recently discovered

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.096
that there are cracks available
in the Greenland ice sheet

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.760
near this glacier aquifer.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.696
You can fly over
most of the Greenland ice sheet

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.936
and see nothing,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.856
no cracks, no features on the surface,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.056
but as this helicopter
flies towards the coast,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.696
the path that water would take
on its quest to flow downhill,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.296
one crack appears,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320
then another and another.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.416
Are these cracks filled with liquid water?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.096
And if so, how deep
do they take that water?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.616
Can they take it to the bedrock

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.976
and the ocean?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.696
To answer these questions,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.136
we need something
beyond remote sensing data.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.520
We need numeric models.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.680
I write numeric models
that run on supercomputers.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.776
A numeric model
is simply a set of equations

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.040
that works together to describe something.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.496
It can be as simple
as the next number in a sequence --

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.600
one, three, five, seven --

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.696
or it can be a more complex
set of equations

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.096
that predict the future

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.080
based on known conditions in the present.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.160
In our case, what are
the equations for how ice cracks?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.816
Well, engineers already have
a very good understanding

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.640
of how aluminum, steel and plastics
fracture under stress.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.200
It's an important problem in our society.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.016
And it turns out
that the engineering equations

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.616
for how materials fracture

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.376
are not that different
from my physics homework.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.256
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.736
and then I had a numeric model
for how a crevasse can fracture

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.760
when filled with water from the aquifer.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.736
This is the power of math.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.880
It can help us understand
real processes in our world.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.576
I'll show you now
the results of my numeric model,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.176
but first I should point out

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.016
that the crevasse is about
a thousand times narrower than it is deep,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.536
so in the main panel here,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.656
we've zoomed in to better see the details.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.856
You can look to the smaller
panel on the right

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.040
to see the true scale
for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.016
As the aquifer water
flows into the crevasse,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.016
some of it refreezes
in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.536
That's about as cold
as your kitchen freezer.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.536
But this loss can be overcome

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.800
if the flow rate in from
the glacier aquifer is high enough.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.016
In our case, it is,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.656
and the aquifer water drives the crevasse
all the way to the base of the ice sheet

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.400
a thousand meters below.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.360
From there, it has a clear path
to reach the ocean.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.816
So the aquifer water is a part

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.136
of the three millimeters
per year of sea level rise

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.480
that we experience as a global society.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.776
But there's more:

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.560
the aquifer water
might be punching above its weight.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.640
The ice flows in complex ways.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.936
In some places, the ice flows very fast.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.680
There tends to be water
at the base of the ice sheet here.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.016
In other places, not so fast.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.520
Usually, there's not water
present at the base there.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.376
Now that we know the aquifer water
is getting to the base of the ice sheet,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.136
the next question is:

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.640
Is it making the ice itself
flow faster into the ocean?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.816
We're trying to uncover these mysteries
hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.160
so that we can better plan
for the sea level rise it holds.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.456
The amount of ice
that Greenland has lost since 2002

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.000
is just a small fraction
of what that ice sheet holds.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.976
Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines
that operate on long timescales.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.576
In the next 80 years, global sea levels
will rise at least 20 centimeters,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.776
perhaps as much as one meter,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.576
and maybe more.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.736
Our understanding
of future sea level rise is good,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.136
but our projections have a wide range.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.336
It's our role as glaciologists
and scientists

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.080
to narrow these uncertainties.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.016
How much sea level rise is coming,

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.880
and how fast will it get here?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.976
We need to know how much and how fast,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.320
so the world and its communities can
plan for the sea level rise that's coming.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.256
Thank you.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:59.699
(Applause)
