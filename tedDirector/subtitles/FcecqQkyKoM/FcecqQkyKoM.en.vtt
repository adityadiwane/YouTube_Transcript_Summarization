00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:18.833
I'd like to share with you

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:22.670
the story of one of my patients called Celine.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.823
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district

00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:28.895
of Cameroon in west Central Africa.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.582
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:35.583
she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:38.654
which was running in her health district at the time.

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:42.358
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:44.042
she had gone for 18 months

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.329
without any antiretroviral therapy,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.066
and she was very ill.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.464
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic

00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:53.015
when the trial ended

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.726
because she had no money for the bus fare

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:59.454
and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.198
Now during the clinical trial,

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:05.583
she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.614
and her transportation costs

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:10.221
had been covered by the research funds.

00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:13.575
All of these ended once the trial was completed,

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.567
leaving Celine with no alternatives.

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.243
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs

00:01:19.243 --> 00:01:21.270
she'd received during the trial,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.027
or even what the trial had been about.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:27.576
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:31.983
because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.252
Yet what puzzled me most

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.359
was Celine had given her informed consent

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.191
to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.661
the implications of being a participant

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:48.070
or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.465
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:54.394
of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:56.853
when it is poorly conducted.

00:01:56.853 --> 00:02:00.718
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:04.407
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:07.214
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:12.749
on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.535
But it would have done so at a price

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.482
to hundreds of patients who, like Celine,

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.726
were left to their own devices

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:23.797
once the research had been completed.

00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:27.135
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.148
that conducting HIV clinical trials

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.363
in developing countries is bad.

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:35.730
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.028
and are much needed to address the burden

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.499
of disease in developing countries.

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.358
However, the inequalities that exist between

00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:47.060
richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.217
pose a real risk for exploitation,

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:54.102
especially in the context of externally-funded research.

00:02:54.102 --> 00:02:56.708
Sadly enough, the fact remains that

00:02:56.708 --> 00:03:00.692
a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries

00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:03.268
could never be authorized in the richer countries

00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:05.516
which fund the research.

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.763
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves

00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:09.679
what makes developing countries,

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.223
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:15.790
so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.062
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:22.178
valid and widely applicable results,

00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:26.178
they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.821
and preferably on a population

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:32.602
with a high incidence of new HIV infections.

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:36.073
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:39.275
with 22 million people living with HIV,

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:42.915
an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.396
who are infected worldwide.

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:47.826
Also, research within the continent

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:51.938
is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:55.789
endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.578
A clinical trial that is considered to be

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:01.328
potentially beneficial to the population

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:03.635
is more likely to be authorized,

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:06.435
and in the absence of good health care systems,

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:09.389
almost any offer of medical assistance

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.307
is accepted as better than nothing.

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:14.893
Even more problematic reasons include

00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:17.180
lower risk of litigation,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.647
less rigorous ethical reviews,

00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:22.203
and populations that are willing to participate

00:04:22.203 --> 00:04:26.867
in almost any study that hints at a cure.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.492
As funding for HIV research

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:32.748
increases in developing countries

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:36.755
and ethical review in richer countries become more strict,

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:38.840
you can see why this context becomes

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.401
very, very attractive.

00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:45.081
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers

00:04:45.081 --> 00:04:49.565
to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.844
but on many levels ethically questionable.

00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:56.283
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,

00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:58.603
we do not take an unfair advantage

00:04:58.603 --> 00:05:02.107
of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:05.963
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:09.538
in order to improve the way in which things are done.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:12.365
The first of these is informed consent.

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.733
Now, in order for a clinical trial to be

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:18.414
considered ethically acceptable,

00:05:18.414 --> 00:05:21.238
participants must be given the relevant information

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.673
in a way in which they can understand,

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:27.890
and must freely consent to participate in the trial.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.568
This is especially important in developing countries,

00:05:30.568 --> 00:05:33.470
where a lot of participants consent to research

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.158
because they believe it is the only way in which

00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:39.728
they can receive medical care or other benefits.

00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:42.695
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries

00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:45.497
are often inappropriate or ineffective

00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:47.850
in a lot of developing countries.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.823
For example, it is counterintuitive to have

00:05:50.823 --> 00:05:53.822
an illiterate study participant, like Celine,

00:05:53.822 --> 00:05:57.149
sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.256
let alone understand.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:02.336
Local communities need to be more involved

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:05.609
in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:10.310
in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.126
The information in these trials

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:15.077
needs to be given to the potential participants

00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:19.505
in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:22.326
The second point I would like for you to consider

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:24.764
is the standard of care that is provided

00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:27.710
to participants within any clinical trial.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.407
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:34.388
Should the control group in the clinical trial

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:37.661
be given the best current treatment which is available

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:39.741
anywhere in the world?

00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.709
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care,

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:45.597
such as the best current treatment available

00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:48.909
in the country in which the research is being conducted?

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.249
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.325
which may not be affordable or accessible

00:06:55.325 --> 00:06:59.295
to the study participants once the research has been completed?

00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:03.036
Now, in a situation where the best current treatment

00:07:03.036 --> 00:07:05.675
is inexpensive and simple to deliver,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.703
the answer is straightforward.

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:10.853
However, the best current treatment available

00:07:10.853 --> 00:07:13.740
anywhere in the world is often very difficult

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.427
to provide in developing countries.

00:07:16.427 --> 00:07:19.979
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.756
of the standard of care which is to be provided

00:07:22.756 --> 00:07:25.237
to participants in any clinical trial,

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:30.685
and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:34.182
and most beneficial for the participants within the study.

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:37.433
That brings us to the third point I want you think about:

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:40.284
the ethical review of research.

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:44.083
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:48.211
of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants

00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:50.324
within any clinical trial.

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:53.236
Unfortunately, this is often lacking

00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:56.764
or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.

00:07:56.764 --> 00:08:01.127
Local governments need to set up effective systems

00:08:01.127 --> 00:08:04.004
for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:07.921
which are authorized in different developing countries,

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:10.195
and they need to do this by setting up

00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:12.705
ethical review committees that are independent

00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:16.090
of the government and research sponsors.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.500
Public accountability needs to be promoted

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.733
through transparency and independent review

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:24.772
by nongovernmental and international organizations

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:26.343
as appropriate.

00:08:26.343 --> 00:08:29.853
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:33.076
is what happens to participants in the clinical trial

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.851
once the research has been completed.

00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:39.325
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.837
in the first place without a clear plan

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:43.916
for what would happen to the participants

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:46.356
once the trial has ended.

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:51.484
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that

00:08:51.484 --> 00:08:54.468
an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:56.200
during a clinical trial

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.812
is accessible to the participants of the trial

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:02.360
once the trial has been completed.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.884
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility

00:09:05.884 --> 00:09:09.485
of introducing and maintaining effective treatments

00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:13.326
in the wider community once the trial ends.

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.749
If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,

00:09:16.749 --> 00:09:19.716
then I think they should have to ethically justify

00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:23.743
why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:26.059
Now, fortunately for Celine,

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:28.734
our meeting did not end in my office.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:33.108
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program

00:09:33.108 --> 00:09:34.496
closer to her home,

00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:38.270
and with a support group to help her cope.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.604
Her story has a positive ending,

00:09:40.604 --> 00:09:44.307
but there are thousands of others in similar situations

00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:46.604
who are much less fortunate.

00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:49.028
Although she may not know this,

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:52.893
my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:57.164
in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,

00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:00.884
and made me even more determined to be part of the movement

00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:03.741
to change the way in which things are done.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.109
I believe that every single person

00:10:06.109 --> 00:10:10.484
listening to me tonight can be part of that change.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:13.081
If you are a researcher, I hold you

00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:15.651
to a higher standard of moral conscience,

00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:18.078
to remain ethical in your research,

00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:21.566
and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.

00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:25.244
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,

00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:28.274
I challenge you to hold your employers

00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:31.449
to fund research that is ethically sound.

00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:34.635
If you come from a developing country like myself,

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:37.707
I urge you to hold your government

00:10:37.707 --> 00:10:40.323
to a more thorough review of the clinical trials

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:43.236
which are authorized in your country.

00:10:43.236 --> 00:10:46.904
Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,

00:10:46.904 --> 00:10:49.556
to find an effective vaccine for malaria,

00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:53.398
to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,

00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:56.973
but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly

00:10:56.973 --> 00:11:01.028
and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:03.254
to do this in a humane way.

00:11:03.254 --> 00:11:05.581
Thank you.
