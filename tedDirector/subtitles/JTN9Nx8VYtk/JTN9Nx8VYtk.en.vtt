00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:15.933
My name is Dan Cohen
and I am an academic, as he said.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.576
And what that means is that I argue.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.243
It's an important part of my life.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:22.433
And I like to argue.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.109
And I'm not just an academic,
I'm a philosopher,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.076
so I like to think that I'm actually
pretty good at arguing.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.900
But I also like to think
a lot about arguing.

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:35.843
And in thinking about arguing,
I've come across some puzzles.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:37.776
And one of the puzzles is that,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.343
as I've been thinking
about arguing over the years --

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.776
and it's been decades now --

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.476
I've gotten better at arguing.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.009
But the more that I argue
and the better I get at arguing,

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.333
the more that I lose.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.209
And that's a puzzle.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.100
And the other puzzle
is that I'm actually okay with that.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.343
Why is it that I'm okay with losing

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.809
and why is it that I think good arguers
are actually better at losing?

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.843
Well, there are some other puzzles.

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:02.743
One is: why do we argue?

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.409
Who benefits from arguments?

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:06.776
When I think about arguments,
I'm talking about --

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.643
let's call them academic arguments
or cognitive arguments --

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:11.509
where something cognitive is at stake:

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.276
Is this proposition true?
Is this theory a good theory?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.776
Is this a viable interpretation
of the data or the text? And so on.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.776
I'm not interested really in arguments
about whose turn it is to do the dishes

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.476
or who has to take out the garbage.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.809
Yeah, we have those arguments, too.

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.576
I tend to win those arguments,
because I know the tricks.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.576
But those aren't the important arguments.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.376
I'm interested in academic arguments,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.267
and here are the things that puzzle me.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.743
First, what do good arguers win
when they win an argument?

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.243
What do I win if I convince you

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:44.696
that utilitarianism isn't really
the right framework

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.476
for thinking about ethical theories?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.376
What do we win when we win an argument?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.743
Even before that,

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.009
what does it matter to me

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.976
whether you have this idea
that Kant's theory works

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.176
or Mill is the right ethicist to follow?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.576
It's no skin off my back

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.767
whether you think functionalism
is a viable theory of mind.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.343
So why do we even try to argue?

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.209
Why do we try to convince other people

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.409
to believe things
they don't want to believe,

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.209
and is that even a nice thing to do?

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.476
Is that a nice way to treat
another human being,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.476
try and make them think something
they don't want to think?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.175
Well, my answer is going to make reference
to three models for arguments.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.943
The first model -- let's call it
the dialectical model --

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:25.876
is we think of arguments as war;
you know what that's like --

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.609
a lot of screaming and shouting
and winning and losing.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:30.776
That's not a very helpful
model for arguing,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.543
but it's a pretty common
and entrenched model for arguing.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.809
But there's a second model for arguing:
arguments as proofs.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.909
Think of a mathematician's argument.

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:41.709
Here's my argument.
Does it work? Is it any good?

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:46.209
Are the premises warranted?
Are the inferences valid?

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.776
Does the conclusion follow
from the premises?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.209
No opposition, no adversariality --

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:56.909
not necessarily any arguing
in the adversarial sense.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:58.909
But there's a third model to keep in mind

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.909
that I think is going to be very helpful,

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:05.943
and that is arguments as performances,
arguments in front of an audience.

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:08.909
We can think of a politician
trying to present a position,

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.076
trying to convince
the audience of something.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.576
But there's another twist on this model
that I really think is important;

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.609
namely, that when we argue
before an audience,

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:22.709
sometimes the audience has
a more participatory role in the argument;

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:27.243
that is, arguments are also
[performances] in front of juries,

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:30.043
who make a judgment and decide the case.

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:31.876
Let's call this the rhetorical model,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.609
where you have to tailor your argument
to the audience at hand.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.276
You know, presenting a sound, well-argued,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.676
tight argument in English
before a francophone audience

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.300
just isn't going to work.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.443
So we have these models --
argument as war, argument as proof

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.847
and argument as performance.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:53.933
Of those three, the argument as war
is the dominant one.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.076
It dominates how we talk about arguments,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.143
it dominates how we think about arguments,

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:02.143
and because of that,
it shapes how we argue,

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:03.943
our actual conduct in arguments.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.643
Now, when we talk about arguments,

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:07.643
we talk in a very militaristic language.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.909
We want strong arguments,
arguments that have a lot of punch,

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:12.609
arguments that are right on target.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:15.809
We want to have our defenses up
and our strategies all in order.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.409
We want killer arguments.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.430
That's the kind of argument we want.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.609
It is the dominant way
of thinking about arguments.

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.243
When I'm talking about arguments,

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:28.100
that's probably what you thought of,
the adversarial model.

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:30.942
But the war metaphor,

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:33.709
the war paradigm or model
for thinking about arguments,

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:36.700
has, I think, deforming effects
on how we argue.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.067
First, it elevates tactics over substance.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.109
You can take a class
in logic, argumentation.

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.843
You learn all about the subterfuges

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.743
that people use to try and win
arguments -- the false steps.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:50.943
It magnifies the us-versus
them aspect of it.

00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:54.376
It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.209
And the only foreseeable outcomes
are triumph -- glorious triumph --

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.309
or abject, ignominious defeat.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.076
I think those are deforming effects,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.943
and worst of all, it seems
to prevent things like negotiation

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:13.667
or deliberation or compromise
or collaboration.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:17.400
Think about that one -- have you
ever entered an argument thinking,

00:05:17.424 --> 00:05:20.809
"Let's see if we can hash something out,
rather than fight it out.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.743
What can we work out together?"

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:25.139
I think the argument-as-war metaphor

00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:29.576
inhibits those other kinds
of resolutions to argumentation.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.043
And finally -- this is really
the worst thing --

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:34.876
arguments don't seem to get us
anywhere; they're dead ends.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.576
They are like roundabouts or traffic jams
or gridlock in conversation.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.867
We don't get anywhere.

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:43.709
And one more thing.

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.643
And as an educator, this is the one
that really bothers me:

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:48.843
If argument is war,

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:53.876
then there's an implicit equation
of learning with losing.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.507
And let me explain what I mean.

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:58.609
Suppose you and I have an argument.

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:01.633
You believe a proposition, P, and I don't.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.414
And I say, "Well, why do you believe P?"

00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:05.843
And you give me your reasons.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.243
And I object and say,
"Well, what about ...?"

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.776
And you answer my objection.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.209
And I have a question:
"Well, what do you mean?

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:13.677
How does it apply over here?"

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:15.776
And you answer my question.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.509
Now, suppose at the end of the day,

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.643
I've objected, I've questioned,

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.263
I've raised all sorts of counter
counter-considerations

00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:25.876
and in every case you've responded
to my satisfaction.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.543
And so at the end of the day, I say,

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:31.900
"You know what? I guess you're right: P."

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.843
So, I have a new belief.

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:36.280
And it's not just any belief;

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:42.600
it's well-articulated, examined --
it's a battle-tested belief.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.960
Great cognitive gain.

00:06:44.984 --> 00:06:46.339
OK, who won that argument?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.543
Well, the war metaphor
seems to force us into saying you won,

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:54.276
even though I'm the only one
who made any cognitive gain.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.943
What did you gain, cognitively,
from convincing me?

00:06:57.967 --> 00:07:00.943
Sure, you got some pleasure out of it,
maybe your ego stroked,

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:02.943
maybe you get some professional status

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:05.543
in the field --
"This guy's a good arguer."

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:08.543
But just from a cognitive point of view,

00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:09.843
who was the winner?

00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:14.676
The war metaphor forces us into thinking
that you're the winner and I lost,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.743
even though I gained.

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:19.043
And there's something wrong
with that picture.

00:07:19.067 --> 00:07:21.776
And that's the picture
I really want to change if we can.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.149
So, how can we find ways

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:28.733
to make arguments
yield something positive?

00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:32.633
What we need is new
exit strategies for arguments.

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:36.243
But we're not going to have
new exit strategies for arguments

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:39.576
until we have new entry
approaches to arguments.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600
We need to think
of new kinds of arguments.

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:45.843
In order to do that, well --

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:47.533
I don't know how to do that.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.443
That's the bad news.

00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:52.476
The argument-as-war metaphor
is just ... it's a monster.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.895
It's just taken up habitation in our mind,

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.366
and there's no magic bullet
that's going to kill it.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.025
There's no magic wand
that's going to make it disappear.

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:01.309
I don't have an answer.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:02.676
But I have some suggestions.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.633
Here's my suggestion:

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.884
If we want to think
of new kinds of arguments,

00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:11.567
what we need to do
is think of new kinds of arguers.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.833
So try this:

00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:19.209
Think of all the roles
that people play in arguments.

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.209
There's the proponent and the opponent

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:24.409
in an adversarial, dialectical argument.

00:08:24.433 --> 00:08:26.576
There's the audience
in rhetorical arguments.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.808
There's the reasoner
in arguments as proofs.

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:32.076
All these different roles.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.943
Now, can you imagine an argument
in which you are the arguer,

00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:39.333
but you're also in the audience,
watching yourself argue?

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:43.009
Can you imagine yourself
watching yourself argue,

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:47.509
losing the argument, and yet still,
at the end of the argument, saying,

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:50.033
"Wow, that was a good argument!"

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:52.476
Can you do that?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.808
I think you can, and I think
if you can imagine that kind of argument,

00:08:55.832 --> 00:08:59.609
where the loser says to the winner
and the audience and the jury can say,

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:01.576
"Yeah, that was a good argument,"

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.458
then you have imagined a good argument.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:04.643
And more than that,

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.643
I think you've imagined a good arguer,

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:11.133
an arguer that's worthy of the kind
of arguer you should try to be.

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:14.343
Now, I lose a lot of arguments.

00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:16.776
It takes practice to become a good arguer,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.956
in the sense of being able to benefit
from losing, but fortunately,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.943
I've had many, many colleagues
who have been willing to step up

00:09:22.967 --> 00:09:24.676
and provide that practice for me.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.875
Thank you.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.967
(Applause)
