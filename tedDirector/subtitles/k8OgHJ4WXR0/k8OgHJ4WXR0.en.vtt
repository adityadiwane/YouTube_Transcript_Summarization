00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.072
I'm here to tell you
about the real search for alien life.

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:19.906
Not little green humanoids
arriving in shiny UFOs,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.654
although that would be nice.

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:24.955
But it's the search for planets
orbiting stars far away.

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:27.759
Every star in our sky is a sun.

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:29.164
And if our sun has planets --

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:31.685
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.145
surely those other stars
should have planets also,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:35.431
and they do.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:36.867
And in the last two decades,

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.788
astronomers have found
thousands of exoplanets.

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:43.313
Our night sky is literally
teeming with exoplanets.

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:44.889
We know, statistically speaking,

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.406
that every star has at least one planet.

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:49.961
And in the search for planets,

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.751
and in the future,
planets that might be like Earth,

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:54.144
we're able to help address

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:57.017
some of the most amazing
and mysterious questions

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.612
that have faced humankind for centuries.

00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:00.882
Why are we here?

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:02.889
Why does our universe exist?

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:05.523
How did Earth form and evolve?

00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:08.896
How and why did life originate
and populate our planet?

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:12.720
The second question
that we often think about is:

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.030
Are we alone?

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.299
Is there life out there?

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.601
Who is out there?

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.789
You know, this question has been around
for thousands of years,

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:25.230
since at least the time
of the Greek philosophers.

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:27.801
But I'm here to tell you
just how close we're getting

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:30.706
to finding out the answer
to this question.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.945
It's the first time in human history
that this really is within reach for us.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.273
Now when I think about the possibilities
for life out there,

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:42.384
I think of the fact that our sun
is but one of many stars.

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.703
This is a photograph of a real galaxy,

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:47.173
we think our Milky Way
looks like this galaxy.

00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:48.836
It's a collection of bound stars.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.247
But our [sun] is one
of hundreds of billions of stars

00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:57.595
and our galaxy is one of upwards
of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

00:01:58.707 --> 00:02:01.474
Knowing that small planets
are very common,

00:02:01.498 --> 00:02:02.772
you can just do the math.

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:07.425
And there are just so many stars
and so many planets out there,

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:10.139
that surely, there must be life
somewhere out there.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.480
Well, the biologists get furious
with me for saying that,

00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:17.948
because we have absolutely no evidence
for life beyond Earth yet.

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:23.770
Well, if we were able to look
at our galaxy from the outside

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:26.002
and zoom in to where our sun is,

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:27.586
we see a real map of the stars.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.069
And the highlighted stars
are those with known exoplanets.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:33.934
This is really just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:38.284
Here, this animation is zooming in
onto our solar system.

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:40.357
And you'll see here the planets

00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:43.214
as well as some spacecraft
that are also orbiting our sun.

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:48.332
Now if we can imagine going
to the West Coast of North America,

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:50.482
and looking out at the night sky,

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.784
here's what we'd see on a spring night.

00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:54.818
And you can see
the constellations overlaid

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:57.111
and again, so many stars with planets.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:01.329
There's a special patch of the sky
where we have thousands of planets.

00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:05.043
This is where the Kepler Space Telescope
focused for many years.

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:10.250
Let's zoom in and look
at one of the favorite exoplanets.

00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:14.124
This star is called Kepler-186f.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.727
It's a system of about five planets.

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.576
And by the way, most of these exoplanets,
we don't know too much about.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.583
We know their size, and their orbit
and things like that.

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:27.569
But there's a very special planet
here called Kepler-186f.

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:31.697
This planet is in a zone
that is not too far from the star,

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.980
so that the temperature
may be just right for life.

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:38.035
Here, the artist's conception
is just zooming in

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.329
and showing you what that planet
might be like.

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:48.676
So, many people have this
romantic notion of astronomers

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.256
going to the telescope
on a lonely mountaintop

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.829
and looking at the spectacular night sky
through a big telescope.

00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:59.225
But actually, we just work
on our computers like everyone else,

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:03.074
and we get our data by email
or downloading from a database.

00:04:03.098 --> 00:04:05.621
So instead of coming here to tell you

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.776
about the somewhat tedious nature
of the data and data analysis

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.866
and the complex computer models we make,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.088
I have a different way
to try to explain to you

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:15.757
some of the things
that we're thinking about exoplanets.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:16.947
Here's a travel poster:

00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.291
"Kepler-186f:

00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:22.029
Where the grass is always redder
on the other side."

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.783
That's because Kepler-186f
orbits a red star,

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.499
and we're just speculating
that perhaps the plants there,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:31.141
if there is vegetation
that does photosynthesis,

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:33.108
it has different pigments and looks red.

00:04:34.137 --> 00:04:38.495
"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:39.978
a Super-Earth."

00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:42.159
This planet is more massive than Earth

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:43.905
and has a higher surface gravity.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.230
"Relax on Kepler-16b,

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.150
where your shadow always has company."

00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:51.134
(Laughter)

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:55.340
We know of a dozen planets
that orbit two stars,

00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:57.483
and there's likely many more out there.

00:04:57.507 --> 00:04:59.468
If we could visit one of those planets,

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:01.379
you literally would see two sunsets

00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:02.658
and have two shadows.

00:05:03.484 --> 00:05:05.901
So actually, science fiction
got some things right.

00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.134
Tatooine from Star Wars.

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:10.342
And I have a couple of other
favorite exoplanets

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:11.563
to tell you about.

00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:13.119
This one is Kepler-10b,

00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:15.126
it's a hot, hot planet.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.577
It orbits over 50 times closer to its star

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:20.768
than our Earth does to our sun.

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.372
And actually, it's so hot,

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:25.029
we can't visit any
of these planets, but if we could,

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:27.027
we would melt long before we got there.

00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:29.380
We think the surface
is hot enough to melt rock

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:30.830
and has liquid lava lakes.

00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.041
Gliese 1214b.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.164
This planet, we know the mass and the size

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:36.776
and it has a fairly low density.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.998
It's somewhat warm.

00:05:38.053 --> 00:05:40.737
We actually don't know
really anything about this planet,

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:43.266
but one possibility
is that it's a water world,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.797
like a scaled-up version
of one of Jupiter's icy moons

00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:49.304
that might be 50 percent water by mass.

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:52.289
And in this case, it would have
a thick steam atmosphere

00:05:52.313 --> 00:05:54.169
overlaying an ocean,

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:55.703
not of liquid water,

00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:58.732
but of an exotic form
of water, a superfluid --

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.746
not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.370
And under that wouldn't be rock,

00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:03.990
but a form of high-pressure ice,

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:05.290
like ice IX.

00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:08.768
So out of all these planets out there,

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:12.006
and the variety
is just simply astonishing,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.160
we mostly want to find the planets
that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:19.101
Not too big, not too small,

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.972
not too hot, not too cold --

00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:22.345
but just right for life.

00:06:22.658 --> 00:06:24.776
But to do that,
we'd have to be able to look

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.134
at the planet's atmosphere,

00:06:26.158 --> 00:06:28.954
because the atmosphere
acts like a blanket trapping heat --

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:30.314
the greenhouse effect.

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:33.158
We have to be able to assess
the greenhouse gases

00:06:33.182 --> 00:06:34.332
on other planets.

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.288
Well, science fiction
got some things wrong.

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.186
The Star Trek Enterprise

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.837
had to travel vast distances
at incredible speeds

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.590
to orbit other planets

00:06:44.614 --> 00:06:48.590
so that First Officer Spock
could analyze the atmosphere

00:06:48.614 --> 00:06:50.575
to see if the planet was habitable

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.272
or if there were lifeforms there.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.235
Well, we don't need
to travel at warp speeds

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.388
to see other planet atmospheres,

00:06:57.412 --> 00:07:00.196
although I don't want to dissuade
any budding engineers

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.143
from figuring out how to do that.

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.459
We actually can and do study
planet atmospheres

00:07:04.483 --> 00:07:06.096
from here, from Earth orbit.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.297
This is a picture, a photograph
of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.071
taken by the shuttle Atlantis
as it was departing

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:14.334
after the last
human space flight to Hubble.

00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:16.244
They installed a new camera, actually,

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.413
that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:23.342
And so far, we've been able to study
dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.490
about six of them in great detail.

00:07:25.514 --> 00:07:27.686
But those are not
small planets like Earth.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.104
They're big, hot planets
that are easy to see.

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:31.366
We're not ready,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.765
we don't have the right technology yet
to study small exoplanets.

00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:37.264
But nevertheless,

00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:41.185
I wanted to try to explain to you
how we study exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:41.652 --> 00:07:43.874
I want you to imagine,
for a moment, a rainbow.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.278
And if we could look
at this rainbow closely,

00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:49.969
we would see that some
dark lines are missing.

00:07:51.127 --> 00:07:52.548
And here's our sun,

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.339
the white light of our sun split up,

00:07:54.363 --> 00:07:56.649
not by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.

00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:59.124
And you can see
all these dark, vertical lines.

00:07:59.148 --> 00:08:00.982
Some are very narrow, some are wide,

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:02.407
some are shaded at the edges.

00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:06.035
And this is actually how astronomers
have studied objects in the heavens,

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:07.554
literally, for over a century.

00:08:07.578 --> 00:08:10.004
So here, each different atom and molecule

00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:11.553
has a special set of lines,

00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:13.133
a fingerprint, if you will.

00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:15.894
And that's how we study
exoplanet atmospheres.

00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:18.278
And I'll just never forget
when I started working

00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:20.158
on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,

00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:21.367
how many people told me,

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:22.600
"This will never happen.

00:08:22.624 --> 00:08:25.414
We'll never be able to study them.
Why are you bothering?"

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:29.112
And that's why I'm pleased to tell you
about all the atmospheres studied now,

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:30.985
and this is really a field of its own.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:33.531
So when it comes to
other planets, other Earths,

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.632
in the future when we can observe them,

00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:37.715
what kind of gases
would we be looking for?

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:41.319
Well, you know, our own Earth
has oxygen in the atmosphere

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:42.802
to 20 percent by volume.

00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:44.714
That's a lot of oxygen.

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:48.202
But without plants
and photosynthetic life,

00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:49.636
there would be no oxygen,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.501
virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:54.039
So oxygen is here because of life.

00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:58.170
And our goal then is to look for gases
in other planet atmospheres,

00:08:58.194 --> 00:09:00.231
gases that don't belong,

00:09:00.255 --> 00:09:02.638
that we might be able
to attribute to life.

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:04.743
But which molecules should we search for?

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:07.430
I actually told you
how diverse exoplanets are.

00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:09.451
We expect that to continue in the future

00:09:09.475 --> 00:09:10.776
when we find other Earths.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.372
And that's one of the main things
I'm working on now,

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.689
I have a theory about this.

00:09:14.713 --> 00:09:17.001
It reminds me that nearly every day,

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:19.677
I receive an email or emails

00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:23.328
from someone with a crazy theory
about physics of gravity

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:25.184
or cosmology or some such.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:28.541
So, please don't email me
one of your crazy theories.

00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:29.779
(Laughter)

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:31.981
Well, I had my own crazy theory.

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.989
But, who does the MIT professor go to?

00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:38.914
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate
in Physiology or Medicine

00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:40.911
and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."

00:09:40.935 --> 00:09:42.934
So I brought my two biochemistry friends

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.310
and we went to talk to him
about our crazy theory.

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:48.775
And that theory was that life
produces all small molecules,

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.473
so many molecules.

00:09:50.497 --> 00:09:53.392
Like, everything I could think of,
but not being a chemist.

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:54.599
Think about it:

00:09:54.623 --> 00:09:56.653
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,

00:09:56.677 --> 00:09:58.536
molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.926
methane, methyl chloride --

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.111
so many gases.

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:03.070
They also exist for other reasons,

00:10:03.094 --> 00:10:04.946
but just life even produces ozone.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.728
So we go to talk to him about this,

00:10:06.752 --> 00:10:08.894
and immediately, he shot down the theory.

00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:11.493
He found an example that didn't exist.

00:10:11.948 --> 00:10:13.729
So, we went back to the drawing board

00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:17.181
and we think we have found something
very interesting in another field.

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:18.625
But back to exoplanets,

00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:21.928
the point is that life produces
so many different types of gases,

00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:24.164
literally thousands of gases.

00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:26.855
And so what we're doing now
is just trying to figure out

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.468
on which types of exoplanets,

00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:31.712
which gases could be attributed to life.

00:10:34.182 --> 00:10:36.230
And so when it comes time
when we find gases

00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:37.605
in exoplanet atmospheres

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:39.725
that we won't know
if they're being produced

00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:42.779
by intelligent aliens or by trees,

00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:44.013
or a swamp,

00:10:44.037 --> 00:10:46.898
or even just by simple,
single-celled microbial life.

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.091
So working on the models

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.766
and thinking about biochemistry,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.987
it's all well and good.

00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:54.896
But a really big challenge
ahead of us is: how?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.082
How are we going to find these planets?

00:10:57.106 --> 00:10:59.310
There are actually many ways
to find planets,

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.829
several different ways.

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:04.712
But the one that I'm most focused on
is how can we open a gateway

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:05.973
so that in the future,

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:07.846
we can find hundreds of Earths.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.203
We have a real shot
at finding signs of life.

00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:13.353
And actually, I just finished
leading a two-year project

00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:15.465
in this very special phase

00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:18.143
of a concept we call the starshade.

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:21.120
And the starshade
is a very specially shaped screen

00:11:21.144 --> 00:11:23.011
and the goal is to fly that starshade

00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:26.129
so it blocks out the light of a star

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:29.092
so that the telescope
can see the planets directly.

00:11:29.116 --> 00:11:31.509
Here, you can see myself
and two team members

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:33.722
holding up one small part
of the starshade.

00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:35.326
It's shaped like a giant flower,

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.833
and this is one of the prototype petals.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:43.368
The concept is that a starshade
and telescope could launch together,

00:11:43.392 --> 00:11:45.986
with the petals unfurling
from the stowed position.

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:48.952
The central truss would expand,

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:52.068
with the petals snapping into place.

00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:54.322
Now, this has to be made very precisely,

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.934
literally, the petals to microns

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.673
and they have to deploy to millimeters.

00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:00.752
And this whole structure would have to fly

00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:04.135
tens of thousands of kilometers
away from the telescope.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:06.301
It's about tens of meters in diameter.

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:11.738
And the goal is to block out
the starlight to incredible precision

00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:14.500
so that we'd be able to see
the planets directly.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.562
And it has to be a very special shape,

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.475
because of the physics of defraction.

00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:21.718
Now this is a real project
that we worked on,

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:24.210
literally, you would not believe how hard.

00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:26.896
Just so you believe
it's not just in movie format,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.556
here's a real photograph

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.571
of a second-generation
starshade deployment test bed in the lab.

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:35.674
And in this case,
I just wanted you to know

00:12:35.698 --> 00:12:38.188
that that central truss
has heritage left over

00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:40.126
from large radio deployables in space.

00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:43.028
So after all of that hard work

00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:46.845
where we try to think of all the crazy
gases that might be out there,

00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:49.797
and we build the very
complicated space telescopes

00:12:49.821 --> 00:12:51.048
that might be out there,

00:12:51.072 --> 00:12:52.368
what are we going to find?

00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:54.483
Well, in the best case,

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.304
we will find an image
of another exo-Earth.

00:12:58.328 --> 00:13:00.587
Here is Earth as a pale blue dot.

00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:03.170
And this is actually
a real photograph of Earth

00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:05.064
taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.706
four billion miles away.

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.397
And that red light is just scattered light
in the camera optics.

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:13.711
But what's so awesome to consider

00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:16.784
is that if there are intelligent aliens

00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:20.762
orbiting on a planet
around a star near to us

00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:22.831
and they build complicated
space telescopes

00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:24.782
of the kind that we're trying to build,

00:13:24.806 --> 00:13:27.306
all they'll see is this pale blue dot,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.615
a pinprick of light.

00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:32.522
And so sometimes, when I pause to think

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:36.799
about my professional struggle
and huge ambition,

00:13:36.823 --> 00:13:38.816
it's hard to think about that

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.259
in contrast to the vastness
of the universe.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.246
But nonetheless, I am devoting
the rest of my life

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.620
to finding another Earth.

00:13:48.296 --> 00:13:50.511
And I can guarantee

00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:52.918
that in the next generation
of space telescopes,

00:13:52.942 --> 00:13:54.482
in the second generation,

00:13:54.506 --> 00:13:59.912
we will have the capability
to find and identity other Earths.

00:13:59.936 --> 00:14:02.610
And the capability
to split up the starlight

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.187
so that we can look for gases

00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:07.697
and assess the greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.319
estimate the surface temperature,

00:14:09.343 --> 00:14:11.101
and look for signs of life.

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:13.157
But there's more.

00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:16.545
In this case of searching
for other planets like Earth,

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:19.164
we are making a new kind of map

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:22.448
of the nearby stars
and of the planets orbiting them,

00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:26.243
including [planets] that actually might be
inhabitable by humans.

00:14:26.915 --> 00:14:29.296
And so I envision that our descendants,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.125
hundreds of years from now,

00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:34.176
will embark on an interstellar
journey to other worlds.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:37.971
And they will look back at all of us

00:14:37.995 --> 00:14:41.003
as the generation who first found
the Earth-like worlds.

00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:42.973
Thank you.

00:14:42.997 --> 00:14:49.508
(Applause)

00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:51.632
June Cohen: And I give you,
for a question,

00:14:51.656 --> 00:14:53.384
Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.

00:14:53.817 --> 00:14:55.848
Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through

00:14:55.872 --> 00:14:59.659
that the technology
to actually look at the spectrum

00:14:59.683 --> 00:15:02.312
of an exoplanet like Earth
is not there yet.

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:04.223
When do you expect this will be there,

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:05.515
and what's needed?

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:10.154
Actually, what we expect is what we call
our next-generation Hubble telescope.

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:12.872
And this is called the James Webb
Space Telescope,

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:14.599
and that will launch in 2018,

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:16.445
and that's what we're going to do,

00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:18.733
we're going to look
at a special kind of planet

00:15:18.757 --> 00:15:20.213
called transient exoplanets,

00:15:20.237 --> 00:15:23.338
and that will be our first shot
at studying small planets

00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:26.660
for gases that might indicate
the planet is habitable.

00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:30.286
JC: I'm going to ask you
one follow-up question, too, Sara,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.516
as the generalist.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.633
So I am really struck
by the notion in your career

00:15:34.657 --> 00:15:36.056
of the opposition you faced,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.224
that when you began thinking
about exoplanets,

00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:40.914
there was extreme skepticism
in the scientific community

00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:42.089
that they existed,

00:15:42.113 --> 00:15:43.382
and you proved them wrong.

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:45.119
What did it take to take that on?

00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:47.213
SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.195
we're supposed to be skeptical,

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:52.267
because our job to make sure
that what the other person is saying

00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:53.630
actually makes sense or not.

00:15:53.654 --> 00:15:56.211
But being a scientist,

00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:58.655
I think you've seen it from this session,

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:00.361
it's like being an explorer.

00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:02.374
You have this immense curiosity,

00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:03.697
this stubbornness,

00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:06.103
this sort of resolute will
that you will go forward

00:16:06.127 --> 00:16:08.158
no matter what other people say.

00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:09.858
JC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.

00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:12.877
(Applause)
