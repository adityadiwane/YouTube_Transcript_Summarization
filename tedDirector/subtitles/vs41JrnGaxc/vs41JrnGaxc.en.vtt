00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
They go to see Michelangelo's "David,"

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
and when they finally come face to face with the statue,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
they both freeze dead in their tracks.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
The second guy -- we'll call him Bill --

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.330
is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
So here's my question for you:

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
which for Al Gore?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.330
I don't need a show of hands

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
because we all have the same political stereotypes.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
We all know that it's Bill.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.330
And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
on a major personality trait called openness to experience.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
People who are high in openness to experience

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.330
People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
If you know about this trait,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
You can understand why artists are so different from accountants.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.330
You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
what kinds of places they like to travel to,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
and what kinds of food they like to eat.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
Once you understand this trait, you can understand

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.330
why anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.330
(Laughter)

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
This trait also tells us a lot about politics.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views" --

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
they like a society which is open and changing --

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.330
"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views."

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
So here's the description of a group I found on the Web.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
What kinds of people would join a global community

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
welcoming people from every discipline and culture,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
who seek a deeper understanding of the world,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all?

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
This is from some guy named Ted.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
(Laughter)

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal?

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Let's find out.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center --

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
on social issues, we're talking about, primarily --

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
or conservative, and I'll give a third option,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
So, right now, please raise your hand --

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.330
down in the simulcast rooms, too,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
let's let everybody see who's here --

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.330
Please raise your hand high right now. OK.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
OK, about a -- two dozen.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.330
One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
OK. This is a bit of a problem.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
Because if our goal is to understand the world,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
to seek a deeper understanding of the world,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.330
it shuts down open-minded thinking.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.330
When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.330
and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
(Laughter)

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.330
We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.330
We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.330
(Laughter)

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.330
(Applause)

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.330
So, if you think that half of America votes Republican

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.330
because they are blinded in this way,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.330
in a particular moral matrix.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
But I'm here today to give you a choice.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.330
You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
or you can take the red pill,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Now, because I know --

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
(Applause) --

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
OK, I assume that answers my question.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
You're all high in openness to experience, and besides,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.330
So anyway, let's go with the red pill.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
Let's start at the beginning.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
What is morality and where does it come from?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330
The worst idea in all of psychology

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
Developmental psychology has shown

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
that kids come into the world already knowing so much

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
about the physical and social worlds,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.330
and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.330
and hard to learn others.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
The best definition of innateness I've ever seen --

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
this just clarifies so many things for me --

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.330
is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.330
He says, "The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.330
Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Built-in doesn't mean unmalleable;

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
it means organized in advance of experience."

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.330
read through the literature on anthropology,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
on culture variation in morality

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
That you find across cultures and even across species?

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
We found five -- five best matches,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
which we call the five foundations of morality.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
The first one is harm/care.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
that makes us really bond with others, care for others,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
There's actually ambiguous evidence

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
but the evidence for people could not be clearer.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
This Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule,"

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330
and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
as the foundation of so many religions.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
You do find groups in the animal kingdom --

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
you do find cooperative groups --

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.330
who are able to cooperate, join together into groups,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.330
but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
that even when we don't have tribes,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.330
we go ahead and make them, because it's fun.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
(Laughter)

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.330
The fourth foundation is authority/respect.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
as it is in other primates.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.330
It's based on more voluntary deference,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.330
and even elements of love, at times.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,"

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
that tells you that you can attain virtue

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.330
by controlling what you do with your body,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
by controlling what you put into your body.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.330
And while the political right may moralize sex much more,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.330
the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and a lot of it is ideas about purity,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.330
about what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.330
I believe these are the five best candidates

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.330
I think this is what we come with, at least

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
a preparedness to learn all of these things.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
how is this first draft going to get revised?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
And how will it end up being different

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
If there really are five systems at work in the mind --

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
five sources of intuitions and emotions --

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
then we can think of the moral mind

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.330
where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330
And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.330
made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.330
And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Here are the results.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.330
The blue line shows you people's responses

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
on the average of all the harm questions.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
all across the board, but as you also see,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
liberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
Same story for fairness.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
But look at the other three lines.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
For liberals, the scores are very low.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
Liberals are basically saying, "No, this is not morality.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
In-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it."

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
But as people get more conservative, the values rise.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.330
or two-foundation morality.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
Conservatives have more of a five-foundation,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
or five-channel morality.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.330
We find this in every country we look at.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
I'll just flip through a few other slides.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
The U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.330
Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
Notice also that on all of these graphs,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.330
the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
Which shows that within any country,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.330
the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Everybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair --

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
Moral arguments within cultures

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
In one recent study,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.330
You picked a particular breed,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
you learned some new information about the breed.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!"

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
Because liberals like to say, "Fetch, please."

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.330
(Laughter)

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.330
If you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
to its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
for conservatives, well, loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.330
But to a liberal, it sounds like this dog

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
is running for the Republican nomination.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
(Laughter)

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.330
So, you might say, OK,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.330
there are these differences between liberals and conservatives,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
but what makes those three other foundations moral?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
and authoritarianism and Puritanism?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.330
What makes them moral?

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
"The Garden of Earthly Delights."

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
In the first panel, we see the moment of creation.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
are doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
But then, given the way of the world, things change.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
We get every person doing whatever he wants,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.330
with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
Some of you might recognize this as the '60s.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.330
(Laughter)

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.330
But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.330
where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.330
Of course, Bosch called this hell.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
So this triptych, these three panels

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.330
portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
The truth of social entropy.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
here's the same story, the same progression,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.330
in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330
A game in which you give people money,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.330
and then, on each round of the game,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.330
they can put money into a common pot,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
and then the experimenter doubles what's in there,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
and then it's all divided among the players.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
where we're asking people to make a sacrifice

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
But you really want everybody else to sacrifice,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
but everybody has a temptation to a free ride.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.330
And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative --

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and this is all played anonymously.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.330
On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.330
But they quickly see, "You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate."

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.330
And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
But then -- and here's the trick --

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.330
Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.330
"You know what? New rule.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.330
If you want to give some of your own money

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that."

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330
And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
cooperation shoots up.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
It shoots up and it keeps going up.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
It really helps to have some sort of punishment.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
you need some sort of punishment to bring people,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.330
when they're in large groups, to cooperate.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.330
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion --

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
priming God, making people think about God --

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.330
often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
Some people think that religion is an adaptation

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
evolved both by cultural and biological evolution

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.330
to make groups to cohere,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
in part for the purpose of trusting each other,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
and then being more effective at competing with other groups.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.330
I think that's probably right,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
although this is a controversial issue.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
But I'm particularly interested in religion,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.330
Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
The Grand Canyon is really simple.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
and you get the Grand Canyon.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.330
It's not that complicated.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
This is what's really complicated,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.330
that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.330
cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.330
or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.330
grew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.330
How did this happen?

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
This is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.330
The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.330
It took all of our moral psychology

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
to create these cooperative groups.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.330
you do need a psychology of justice.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.330
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.330
and if those sub-groups have some internal structure,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
and if you have some ideology that tells people

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
And now we get to the crux of the disagreement

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.330
between liberals and conservatives.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.330
Because liberals reject three of these foundations.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
They say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership."

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
They say, "Let's question authority."

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
And they say, "Keep your laws off my body."

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.330
Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.330
Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.330
and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.330
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
This guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.330
If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
it's change, it's fun.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.330
They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.330
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.330
It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
This was after the chaos of the French Revolution.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
So once you see this -- once you see

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330
that they form a balance on change versus stability --

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.330
then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.330
This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
Think about yin and yang.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.330
Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.330
Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.330
for the functioning of the world.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
You find the same thing in Hinduism.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
There are many high gods in Hinduism.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.330
Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.330
This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.330
You have the markings of Vishnu on the left,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.330
so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
You have the markings of Shiva on the right,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.330
Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
You find the same thing in Buddhism.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.330
These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
that have ever been attained into moral psychology.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
From the Zen master Seng-ts'an:

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.330
"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.330
The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease."

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.330
Now unfortunately, it's a disease

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
that has been caught by many of the world's leaders.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.330
But before you feel superior to George Bush,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.330
before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
Can you be not for or against anything?

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.330
So, what's the point? What should you do?

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.330
Well, if you take the greatest insights

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
from ancient Asian philosophies and religions,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
I think you come to these conclusions:

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
that our righteous minds were designed by evolution

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.330
to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.330
and then to blind us to the truth.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.330
So what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.330
Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
stop with this struggle of for and against?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.330
No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.330
This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.330
using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
to make the world a better place, to fight --

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.330
to fight wrongs, to solve problems.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.330
But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.330
about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.330
saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right."

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
A lot of the problems we have to solve

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.330
are problems that require us to change other people.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.330
And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.330
is to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.330
understand that we all think we're right -- and then step out,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.330
even if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.330
Step out of the moral matrix,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.330
just try to see it as a struggle playing out,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
in which everybody does think they're right,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.330
and everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them --

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.330
everybody has some reasons for what they're doing.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.330
Step out.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.330
And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.330
to get yourself out of this self-righteousness,

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.330
which is the normal human condition.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.330
Think about the Dalai Lama.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.330
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama --

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.330
and it comes from his moral humility.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.330
So I think the point -- the point of my talk,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.330
and I think the point of TED --

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.330
is that this is a group that is passionately engaged

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.330
People here are passionately engaged

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.330
in trying to make the world a better place.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.330
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.330
And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.330
to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.330
Thank you.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.330
(Applause)
