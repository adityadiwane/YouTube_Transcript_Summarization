I’m working a lot with motion and animation,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.160
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
but they always seem to be so reactive.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.160
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.160
and try to make the music be the voice

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
and have the animation following it?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.160
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
and we did this little animation.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
that it deals with two problematic issues,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.160
which are rising waters and religion.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.160
he warned Noah to build an Ark.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.160
And after Noah built his Ark,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.160
I believe he told Noah to warn the people

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.160
that they must change all their wicked ways

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.160
before he come upon them and destroy them.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160
And when Noah had done built his Ark,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I understand that somebody began to rend a song.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.160
And the song began to move on I understand like this.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.160
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.160
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.160
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
(Applause)
