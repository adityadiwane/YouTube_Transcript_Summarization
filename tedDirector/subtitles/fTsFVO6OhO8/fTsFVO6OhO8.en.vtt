00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:17.701
These dragons from deep time
are incredible creatures.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.146
They're bizzarre,

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:20.856
they're beautiful,

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:23.841
and there's very little
we know about them.

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.131
These thoughts were going
through my head

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.574
when I looked at the pages of
my first dinosaur book.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:33.078
I was about five years old at the time,

00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:35.031
and I decided there and then

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.876
that I would become a paleontologist.

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:41.213
Paleontology allowed me 
to combine my love for animals

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:45.941
with my desire to travel to 
far-flung corners of the world.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.964
And now, a few years later,
I've led several expeditions

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:54.146
to the ultimate far-flung corner 
on this planet, the Sahara.

00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:58.195
I've worked in the Sahara because
I've been on a quest

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:03.300
to uncover new remains of
a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.451
called Spinosaurus.

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.804
A few bones of this animal
have been found

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:11.184
in the deserts of Egypt

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:16.537
and were described about 100 years ago
by a German paleontologist.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:21.485
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones
were destroyed in World War II.

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:25.789
So all we're left with are just
a few drawings and notes.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.050
From these drawings,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.461
we know that this creature, which lived 
about 100 million years ago,

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.012
was very big,

00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:35.425
it had tall spines on its back,
forming a magnificent sail,

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:40.172
and it had long, slender jaws, 
a bit like a crocodile,

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:43.760
with conical teeth,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.647
that may have been used 
to catch slippery prey, like fish.

00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:50.704
But that was pretty much 
all we knew

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:54.303
about this animal for the next 100 years.

00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:03.365
My fieldwork took me to the border region
between Morocco and Algeria,

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:05.938
a place called the Kem Kem.

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:08.251
It's a difficult place to work in.

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.940
You have to deal with sandstorms
and snakes and scorpions,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.084
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.900
But our hard work paid off.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.115
We discovered many incredible specimens.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:21.867
There's the largest dinosaur bone

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.375
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.

00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:28.969
We found remains of giant
predatory dinosaurs,

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.632
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:37.231
and seven or eight different kinds
of crocodile-like hunters.

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.233
These fossils were deposited
in a river system.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:44.403
The river system was also home 
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:47.863
a monster sawfish,

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:51.563
and the skies over the river system
were filled with pterosaurs,

00:02:51.563 --> 00:02:53.591
flying reptiles.

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:55.210
It was a pretty dangerous place,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.929
not the kind of place where you'd want
to travel to if you had a time machine.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.079
So we're finding all these 
incredible fossils of animals

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.769
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.538
but Spinosaurus itself proved
to be very elusive.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.285
We were just finding bits and pieces

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:14.700
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.357
Finally, very recently,

00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:20.467
we were able to track down a dig site

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:25.431
where a local fossil hunter found
several bones of Spinosaurus.

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:28.291
We returned to the site,
we collected more bones.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.364
And so after 100 years we finally
had another partial skeleton

00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:34.525
of this bizarre creature.

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:36.196
And we were able to reconstruct it.

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:38.090
We now know that 
Spinosaurus had a head

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.886
a little bit like a crocodile,

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.081
very different from other 
predatory dinosaurs,

00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:44.818
very different from the T. rex.

00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:49.671
But the really interesting information
came from the rest of the skeleton.

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.004
We had long spines,

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.632
the spines forming the big sail.

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.877
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:59.325
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:02.140
again, very unusual, no other
dinosaur has feet like this --

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.251
and we think they may have been
used to walk on soft sediment,

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:07.943
or maybe for paddling in the water.

00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:11.381
We also looked at the fine
microstructure of the bone,

00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.377
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,

00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:16.136
and it turns out that they're
very dense and compact.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:19.994
Again, this is something we see in animals
that spend a lot of time in the water,

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:23.186
it's useful for buoyancy 
control in the water.

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:28.559
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.770
And when we looked 
at the digital skeleton,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.206
we realized that yes, this was
a dinosaur unlike any other.

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:36.805
It's bigger than a T. rex,

00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:39.530
and yes, the head has "fish-eating"
written all over it,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.629
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.464
dense bone, paddle-like feet,
and the hind limbs are reduced in size,

00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:50.672
and again, this is something
we see in animals

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:53.551
that spend a substantial amount 
of time in the water.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:58.104
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --

00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:02.268
I'm looking at muscle attachments
and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:06.148
we realize that we're dealing
with a river monster,

00:05:06.148 --> 00:05:08.477
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.253
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:14.503
feeding on the many aquatic animals
I showed you earlier on.

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:17.369
So that's really what makes this
an incredible discovery.

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.874
It's a dinosaur like no other.

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:22.441
And some people told me, "Wow,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:25.703
There are not many things left
to discover in the world."

00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:29.975
Well, I think nothing could be 
further from the truth.

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:32.246
I think the Sahara's 
still full of treasures,

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:35.431
and when people tell me there are
no places left to explore,

00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:39.468
I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,
Roy Chapman Andrews,

00:05:39.468 --> 00:05:45.084
and he said, "Always, there has been
an adventure just around the corner --

00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:47.896
and the world is still full of corners."

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.815
That was true many decades ago

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.857
when Roy Chapman Andrews
wrote these lines.

00:05:51.857 --> 00:05:53.839
And it is still true today.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:54.727
Thank you.

00:05:54.727 --> 00:05:57.421
(Applause)
