00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.547
My son and the iPhone
were born three weeks apart

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.591
in June 2007.

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:22.736
So while those early adopters
were lined up outside,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.685
waiting to get their hands
on this amazing new gadget,

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:29.653
I was stuck at home
with my hands full of something else

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:31.923
that was sending out
constant notifications --

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:33.780
(Laughter)

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.416
a miserable, colicky baby

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.429
who would only sleep in a moving stroller
with complete silence.

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:45.187
I literally was walking
10 to 15 miles a day,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.786
and the baby weight came off.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.411
That part was great.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:51.193
But man, was I bored.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.369
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.960
who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.405
I was one of the first
people into Belgrade

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.930
when there was a revolution in Serbia.

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:03.776
Now, I was exhausted.

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:07.062
This walking went on for weeks.

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:12.529
It was only until about three months in
that something shifted, though.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.640
As I pounded the pavement,

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:17.827
my mind started to wander, too.

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:22.101
I began imagining what I would do
when I finally did sleep again.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.133
So the colic did fade,

00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:26.956
and I finally got an iPhone

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.875
and I put all those hours
of wandering into action.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.815
I created my dream job
hosting a public radio show.

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:35.999
So there was no more
rushing off to war zones,

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:37.925
but thanks to my new smartphone,

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:40.220
I could be a mother and a journalist.

00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:44.596
I could be on the playground
and on Twitter at the same time.

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.292
Yeah, well, when I thought that,

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:49.363
when the technology came in and took over,

00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:51.537
that is when I hit a wall.

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.386
So, I want you to picture this:

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.664
you host a podcast, and you have to prove

00:01:56.688 --> 00:02:00.108
that the investment
of precious public radio dollars in you

00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:01.308
is worth it.

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:05.577
My goal was to increase
my audience size tenfold.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:08.065
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.365
as you do,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.358
and I came up barren.

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:13.553
This was different
than writer's block, right?

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:16.652
It wasn't like there was something there
waiting to be unearthed.

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:18.100
There was just nothing.

00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:19.602
And so I started to think back:

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.393
When was the last time
I actually had a good idea?

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:25.167
Yeah, it was when I was pushing
that damn stroller.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:29.281
Now all the cracks in my day
were filled with phone time.

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.830
I checked the headlines
while I waited for my latte.

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.926
I updated my calendar
while I was sitting on the couch.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.375
Texting turned every spare moment

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.688
into a chance to show to my coworkers
and my dear husband

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.314
what a responsive person I was,

00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:48.223
or at least it was a chance to find
another perfect couch

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.953
for my page on Pinterest.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.644
I realized that I was never bored.

00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:56.438
And anyway, don't only
boring people get bored?

00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:58.410
But then I started to wonder:

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:00.696
What actually happens to us
when we get bored?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.897
Or, more importantly: What happens to us
if we never get bored?

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:09.872
And what could happen if we got rid of
this human emotion entirely?

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:14.147
I started talking to neuroscientists
and cognitive psychologists,

00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.096
and what they told me was fascinating.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.913
It turns out that when you get bored,

00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:23.021
you ignite a network in your brain
called the "default mode."

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:27.904
So our body, it goes on autopilot
while we're folding the laundry

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:29.295
or we're walking to work,

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.280
but actually that is when our brain
gets really busy.

00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:35.176
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:38.430
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:
Once you start daydreaming

00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:40.270
and allow your mind to really wander,

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:42.853
you start thinking a little bit
beyond the conscious,

00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:44.600
a little bit into the subconscious,

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.796
which allows sort of different
connections to take place.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.310
It's really awesome, actually.

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:51.348
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.067
So this is my brain in an fMRI,

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.044
and I learned that in the default mode
is when we connect disparate ideas,

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.578
we solve some of our most
nagging problems,

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:03.643
and we do something called
"autobiographical planning."

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.562
This is when we look back at our lives,

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:08.785
we take note of the big moments,
we create a personal narrative,

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.317
and then we set goals

00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:13.458
and we figure out what steps
we need to take to reach them.

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:17.931
But now we chill out on the couch
also while updating a Google Doc

00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:19.875
or replying to email.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.427
We call it "getting shit done,"

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:25.489
but here's what neuroscientist
Dr. Daniel Levitin says

00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:26.829
we're actually doing.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.567
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin:
Every time you shift your attention

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:31.903
from one thing to another,

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:34.655
the brain has to engage
a neurochemical switch

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.910
that uses up nutrients in the brain
to accomplish that.

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:40.353
So if you're attempting to multitask,

00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:42.700
you know, doing four
or five things at once,

00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:45.265
you're not actually doing
four or five things at once,

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.214
because the brain doesn't work that way.

00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:50.089
Instead, you're rapidly shifting
from one thing to the next,

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.156
depleting neural resources as you go.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.967
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,
you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.

00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.308
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have
a limited supply of that stuff.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.741
MZ: A decade ago, we shifted
our attention at work

00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:03.025
every three minutes.

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:05.942
Now we do it every 45 seconds,

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.803
and we do it all day long.

00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:11.163
The average person checks email
74 times a day,

00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:13.474
and switches tasks on their computer

00:05:13.498 --> 00:05:17.394
566 times a day.

00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:20.919
I discovered all this
talking to professor of informatics,

00:05:20.943 --> 00:05:22.667
Dr. Gloria Mark.

00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:26.673
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find
that when people are stressed,

00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:29.868
they tend to shift
their attention more rapidly.

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.131
We also found, strangely enough,

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:37.855
that the shorter the amount of sleep
that a person gets,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.975
the more likely they are
to check Facebook.

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.041
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.

00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:46.163
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:49.869
What would happen
if we broke this vicious cycle?

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:53.980
Maybe my listeners could help me find out.

00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:57.931
What if we reclaimed
those cracks in our day?

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:01.650
Could it help us
jump-start our creativity?

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:06.468
We called the project
"Bored and Brilliant."

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:11.133
And I expected, you know,
a couple hundred people to play along,

00:06:11.157 --> 00:06:14.234
but thousands of people
started signing up.

00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:16.430
And they told me the reason
they were doing it

00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:19.868
was because they were worried
that their relationship with their phone

00:06:19.892 --> 00:06:24.060
had grown kind of ...
"codependent," shall we say.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:27.755
(Audio) Man: The relationship
between a baby and its teddy bear

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.594
or a baby and its binky

00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:32.896
or a baby that wants its mother's cradle

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.942
when it's done with being held
by a stranger --

00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:37.018
(Laughs)

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:39.994
that's the relationship
between me and my phone.

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:42.793
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone
like a power tool:

00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:46.726
extremely useful, but dangerous
if I'm not handling it properly.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.028
(Audio) Woman 2:
If I don't pay close attention,

00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:51.505
I'll suddenly realize
that I've lost an hour of time

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.520
doing something totally mindless.

00:06:53.544 --> 00:06:55.847
MZ: OK, but to really measure
any improvement,

00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:57.292
we needed data, right?

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.507
Because that's what we do these days.

00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:02.669
So we partnered with some apps
that would measure how much time

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:04.785
we were spending every day on our phone.

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.286
If you're thinking it's ironic

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.359
that I asked people
to download another app

00:07:08.383 --> 00:07:10.906
so that they would spend
less time on their phones:

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.237
yeah, but you gotta meet people
where they are.

00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:14.757
(Laughter)

00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:16.565
So before challenge week,

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.457
we were averaging two hours
a day on our phones

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.189
and 60 pickups,

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:23.940
you know, like, a quick check,
did I get a new email?

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:26.174
Here's what Tina, a student
at Bard College,

00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:27.710
discovered about herself.

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:30.529
(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending

00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:34.015
between 150 and 200 minutes
on my phone per day,

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.606
and I've been picking up my phone
70 to 100 times per day.

00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:39.864
And it's really concerning,

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.322
because that's so much time
that I could have spent

00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:46.198
doing something more productive,
more creative, more towards myself,

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:49.180
because when I'm on my phone,
I'm not doing anything important.

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:52.549
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting
to observe their own behavior.

00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:55.147
They were getting ready
for challenge week.

00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:56.945
And that Monday,

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:59.844
they started to wake up
to instructions in their inbox,

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:01.434
an experiment to try.

00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:03.436
Day one:

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.045
"Put it in your pocket."

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:07.361
Take that phone out of your hand.

00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:10.360
See if you can eliminate the reflex
to check it all day long,

00:08:10.384 --> 00:08:11.878
just for a day.

00:08:11.902 --> 00:08:13.383
And if this sounds easy,

00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:14.656
you haven't tried it.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.740
Here's listener Amanda Itzko.

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:20.504
(Audio) Amanda Itzko:
I am absolutely itching.

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:22.984
I feel a little bit crazy,

00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:27.692
because I have noticed
that I pick up my phone

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:31.624
when I'm just walking
from one room to another,

00:08:31.648 --> 00:08:32.914
getting on the elevator,

00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:36.715
and even -- and this is the part
that I am really embarrassed

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:38.726
to actually say out loud --

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.177
in the car.

00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:41.374
MZ: Yikes.

00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:43.067
Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned,

00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:46.474
this itching feeling
is not actually her fault.

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:50.849
That is exactly the behavior
that the technology is built to trigger.

00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:53.781
(Laughter)

00:08:55.557 --> 00:08:57.603
I mean, right?

00:08:57.627 --> 00:09:00.519
Here's former Google designer,
Tristan Harris.

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:04.505
(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook
or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:06.387
I have literally a thousand engineers

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:08.982
whose job is to get
more attention from you.

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:10.545
I'm very good at this,

00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:12.285
and I don't want you to ever stop.

00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:14.531
And you know, the CEO
of Netflix recently said,

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.777
"Our biggest competitors
are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."

00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:21.075
I mean, so there's a million places
to spend your attention,

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:23.026
but there's a war going on to get it.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.748
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling:

00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:26.901
that amazing episode
of "Transparent" ends,

00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:28.677
and then the next one starts playing

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.601
so you're like, eh, OK fine,
I'll just stay up and watch it.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.704
Or the LinkedIn progress bar
says you are this close

00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:36.884
to having the perfect profile,

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:40.016
so you add a little more
personal information.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.034
As one UX designer told me,

00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:45.331
the only people who refer
to their customers as "users"

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.423
are drug dealers and technologists.

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:48.803
(Laughter)

00:09:48.827 --> 00:09:51.771
(Applause)

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:58.623
And users, as we know,
are worth a lot of money.

00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:02.057
Here's former Facebook
product manager and author,

00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:04.647
Antonio García Martínez.

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:08.685
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez:
The saying is, if any product is free

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.310
then you're the product;
your attention is the product.

00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:12.908
But what is your attention worth?

00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:15.185
That's why literally every time
you load a page,

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:16.749
not just on Facebook or any app,

00:10:16.773 --> 00:10:19.844
there's an auction being held instantly,
billions of times a day,

00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:22.182
for exactly how much
that one ad impression cost.

00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:25.493
MZ: By the way, the average person
will spend two years of their life

00:10:25.517 --> 00:10:26.675
on Facebook.

00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:28.584
So, back to challenge week.

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:32.020
Immediately, we saw
some creativity kick in.

00:10:32.044 --> 00:10:33.790
Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:36.757
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.

00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.386
So I suddenly looked at the stairway
that went up to the top of the station,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.949
and I thought, you know,

00:10:42.973 --> 00:10:46.234
I had just come down that stairway,
but I could go back up

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:48.743
and then come back down
and get a little cardio.

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:49.931
So I did,

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:53.796
and then I had a little more time,
so I did it again and I did it again,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.626
and I did it 10 times.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.021
And I had a complete cardio workout.

00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:00.472
I got on that R train feeling
kind of exhausted,

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:03.160
but, like, wow,
that had never occurred to me.

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.579
How is that possible?

00:11:04.603 --> 00:11:05.707
(Laughter)

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:09.717
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means
different things to different people.

00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.741
(Laughter)

00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:14.318
But everyone found
day three's challenge the hardest.

00:11:14.342 --> 00:11:16.558
It was called "Delete that app."

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:18.459
Take that app -- you know the one;

00:11:18.483 --> 00:11:21.259
that one that always gets you,
it sucks you in --

00:11:21.283 --> 00:11:22.446
take it off your phone,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.858
even if just for the day.

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:27.144
I deleted the game Two Dots
and nearly cried.

00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:28.214
(Laughter)

00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:30.657
Yeah, Two Dots players
know what I'm talking about.

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.197
But my misery had good company.

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:38.446
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam
in Los Angeles,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.303
and I deleted Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:44.482
from my phone

00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:46.107
in one fell swoop.

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:50.772
And it was kind of an embarrassingly
emotional experience at first.

00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:54.668
It felt weirdly lonely
to look at that lock screen

00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:57.049
with no new notifications on it.

00:11:57.073 --> 00:12:00.121
But I really liked deciding for myself

00:12:00.145 --> 00:12:03.537
when to think about or access
my social networks,

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:06.927
not giving my phone the power
to decide that for me.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:08.737
So thank you.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.452
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app
was very sad,

00:12:11.476 --> 00:12:15.014
and I feel I maybe, over the last year
when I've been on Twitter,

00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:16.658
have developed an addiction to it,

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:20.070
and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge
has really made me realize it.

00:12:20.094 --> 00:12:23.226
After a brief period of really horrible
withdrawal feeling,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.219
like lack-of-caffeine headache,

00:12:25.243 --> 00:12:26.819
I now feel lovely.

00:12:26.843 --> 00:12:28.654
I had a lovely dinner with my family,

00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:33.353
and I hope to continue this structured use
of these powerful tools.

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.876
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have
that guilty gut feeling

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.195
I have when I know
I'm wasting time on my phone.

00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:41.721
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself
challenges and reminders like this

00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:42.897
every morning.

00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:44.614
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.105
I could not wait to see
what the numbers said

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:48.793
at the end of that week.

00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:51.874
But when the data came in,

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:54.171
it turned out that we had cut down,

00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:55.433
on average,

00:12:55.457 --> 00:12:57.723
just six minutes --

00:12:57.747 --> 00:13:00.557
from 120 minutes a day on our phones

00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.418
to 114.

00:13:03.474 --> 00:13:05.093
Yeah. Whoop-de-do.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:08.827
So I went back to the scientists
feeling kind of low,

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:10.331
and they just laughed at me,

00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:12.786
and they said, you know,
changing people's behavior

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.343
in such a short time period

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:16.594
was ridiculously ambitious,

00:13:16.618 --> 00:13:21.837
and actually what you've achieved
is far beyond what we thought possible.

00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:25.697
Because more important than the numbers,
were the people's stories.

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.363
They felt empowered.

00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:30.026
Their phones had been transformed

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.779
from taskmasters

00:13:31.803 --> 00:13:33.425
back into tools.

00:13:34.528 --> 00:13:38.478
And actually, I found what
the young people said most intriguing.

00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:39.657
Some of them told me

00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:41.943
that they didn't recognize
some of the emotions

00:13:41.967 --> 00:13:43.762
that they felt during challenge week,

00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:45.273
because, if you think about it,

00:13:45.297 --> 00:13:48.261
if you have never known life
without connectivity,

00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.714
you may never have experienced boredom.

00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:53.357
And there could be consequences.

00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:56.810
Researchers at USC have found --
they're studying teenagers

00:13:56.834 --> 00:13:59.794
who are on social media
while they're talking to their friends

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:01.104
or they're doing homework,

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:04.943
and two years down the road,
they are less creative and imaginative

00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:06.821
about their own personal futures

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:11.058
and about solving societal problems,
like violence in their neighborhoods.

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:14.116
And we really need this next generation

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.366
to be able to focus on some big problems:

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.834
climate change, economic disparity,

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.895
massive cultural differences.

00:14:21.482 --> 00:14:24.203
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:28.840
identified creativity as the number one
leadership competency.

00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:31.702
OK, here's the good news, though:

00:14:31.726 --> 00:14:35.497
In the end, 20,000 people
did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:37.953
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:40.847
Seventy percent got more time to think.

00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.000
People told me that they slept better.

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:44.341
They felt happier.

00:14:44.365 --> 00:14:47.989
My favorite note was from a guy
who said he felt like he was waking up

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:50.192
from a mental hibernation.

00:14:51.961 --> 00:14:54.405
Some personal data and some neuroscience

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:57.570
gave us permission
to be offline a little bit more,

00:14:57.594 --> 00:15:00.537
and a little bit of boredom
gave us some clarity

00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:02.880
and helped some of us set some goals.

00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:06.087
I mean, maybe constant connectivity

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.757
won't be cool in a couple of years.

00:15:09.893 --> 00:15:13.451
But meanwhile, teaching people,
especially kids,

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.602
how to use technology
to improve their lives

00:15:16.626 --> 00:15:18.041
and to self-regulate

00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:20.640
needs to be part of digital literacy.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.812
So the next time you go
to check your phone,

00:15:25.452 --> 00:15:29.524
remember that if you don't decide
how you're going to use the technology,

00:15:29.548 --> 00:15:31.866
the platforms will decide for you.

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.414
And ask yourself:

00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:36.176
What am I really looking for?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.895
Because if it's to check email,
that's fine -- do it and be done.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:42.587
But if it's to distract yourself
from doing the hard work

00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:44.911
that comes with deeper thinking,

00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:46.343
take a break,

00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:47.765
stare out the window

00:15:48.487 --> 00:15:51.332
and know that by doing nothing

00:15:51.356 --> 00:15:56.058
you are actually being
your most productive and creative self.

00:15:56.082 --> 00:15:58.805
It might feel weird
and uncomfortable at first,

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:01.715
but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.

00:16:02.214 --> 00:16:03.366
Thank you.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.177
(Applause)
