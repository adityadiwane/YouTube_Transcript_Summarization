00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.330
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330
I'm giving a short slide show this morning

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
that I'm giving for the very first time, so --

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.330
well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.330
I'm actually trying to lower the bar.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
Because I've cobbled this together

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.330
to try to meet the challenge of this session.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.330
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.330
that religion really properly understood

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
is not about belief, but about behavior.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.330
How dare we be optimistic?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
And the outcome about which

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.330
we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.330
by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.330
brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.330
is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
I'm a big advocate of changing

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330
and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.330
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
it is more important to change the laws.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.330
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
we sometimes leave out the citizenship part

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.330
and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.330
we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
In order to solve the climate crisis,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
we have to solve the democracy crisis.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
And we have one.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.330
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
who walked past the table I was sitting at,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.330
just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
until I saw from the corner of my eye

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
she was walking from the opposite direction,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.330
you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.330
I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
And the military historians taught me,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
during that quest, that military conflicts are typically

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.330
put into three categories: local battles,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.330
regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
global, world war -- strategic conflicts.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.330
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
a different approach,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.330
a different organizational model.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.330
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.330
and most of what we think about

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
hazardous waste dumps. But there are also

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
regional environmental problems, like acid rain

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.330
from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.330
to the Arctic, and from the Midwest

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.330
is the rare but all-important

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
global, or strategic, conflict.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.330
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.330
appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.330
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.330
and political will. But the political will

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.330
Let me show you these slides here.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.330
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
of course, is the North Polar ice cap.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.330
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.330
polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.330
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.330
here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.330
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.330
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
Here's what happened last fall

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
that has really unnerved the researchers.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:10.330
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.330
doesn't look quite the same size --

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.330
but it is exactly the same size as the United States,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.330
minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
The amount that disappeared in 2005

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.330
was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.330
The extra amount that disappeared last fall

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.330
but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.330
vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.330
in summer in as little as five years.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.330
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Already, around the Arctic Circle --

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.330
this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:10.330
in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.330
of an area equivalent to the size of California.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330
"They were the best of times,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.330
they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
in English literature. I want to share briefly

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.330
a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.330
is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.330
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.330
has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.330
deposited in the ground as coal, oil,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.330
is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.330
is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.330
it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.330
and putting it into the atmosphere.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
It's three times hotter than Mercury,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:32.330
The global scientific community says:

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.330
man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.330
thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.330
You all know that. At the last

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.330
IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.330
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.330
"more than 90 percent."

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.330
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.330
this could be variations in this energy

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.330
coming in from the sun." If that were true,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.330
the stratosphere would be heated as well as the

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.330
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:16.330
expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.330
CSI: Climate.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330
that human activity is responsible

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
in a significant way. There has been progress,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:45.330
but here is the key: when given a list

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:54.330
of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
What is missing is a sense of urgency.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.330
If you agree with the factual analysis,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.330
but you don't feel the sense of urgency,

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.330
where does that leave you?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.330
in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.330
did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.330
This is the winner.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:13.330
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.330
for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
of the presidential candidates: two of them were about

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:27.330
the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:37.330
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.330
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.330
tobacco commercials.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.330
So here's what we're doing.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:55.330
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:01.330
But it's not just the developed nations.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.330
The developing countries are now following us

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
and accelerating their pace. And actually,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.330
to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.330
very dramatically. The total concentrations:

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:23.330
by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.330
If the wealthy countries were completely missing

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.330
from the picture, we would still have this crisis.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.330
But we have given to the developing countries

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
the technologies and the ways of thinking

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:43.330
that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.330
over thirty years.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.330
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:18.330
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
We have the technologies.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.330
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.330
the struggle against poverty in the world

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.330
and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.330
all has a single, very simple solution.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.330
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:57.330
to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.330
and some things have changed

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.330
since the 19th century.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:06.330
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.330
to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.330
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.330
are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:25.330
But responses can actually make a huge difference

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.330
in the poor countries. This is a proposal

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.330
that has been talked about a lot in Europe.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:45.330
solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
to supply all of the electrical power

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:56.330
to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.330
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.330
We need to do it for our own economy.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
The latest figures show that the old model

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.330
is not working. There are a lot of great investments

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.330
that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:19.330
or shale oil, then you have a portfolio

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.330
that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.330
And it is based on an old model.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.330
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.330
in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:41.330
and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
that I personally think make sense.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.330
But geothermal, concentrating solar,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:56.330
advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.330
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.330
The only two countries that didn't ratify

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.330
-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.330
And there was a campaign in Australia

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.330
that involved television and Internet and radio commercials

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.330
to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.330
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
in every town and village and city in Australia.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
Lot of other things contributed to it,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.330
but the new Prime Minister announced that

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.330
his very first priority would be to change Australia's position

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.330
on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.330
partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.330
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.330
said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.330
we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.330
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.330
We can't wait for the kind of drought

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.330
Australia had to change our political culture.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:14.330
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.330
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:23.330
just to localize this -- which is good news.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:29.330
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:38.330
about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
that it becomes banal or routine.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:50.330
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.330
in the United States of America

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.330
today especially, but also the rest of the world,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:00.330
have to somehow understand that history

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:10.330
has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.330
how to save her life while she was distracted

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.330
by the amazing experience that she was going through.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.330
We now have a culture of distraction.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.330
But we have a planetary emergency.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.330
And we have to find a way to create,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:37.330
in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.330
I wish I could find the words to convey this.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.330
This was another hero generation

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.330
that brought democracy to the planet.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:55.330
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:02.330
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.330
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.330
we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.330
We have the capacity to do it.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:32.330
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.330
we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:42.330
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.330
that history is presenting to us.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:59.330
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.330
by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:07.330
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.330
to reframe that. How many generations

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:16.330
in all of human history have had the opportunity

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:25.330
to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:31.330
A challenge that can pull from us

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:39.330
more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.330
this challenge with a sense of profound joy

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.330
and gratitude that we are the generation

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.330
about which, a thousand years from now,

00:20:52.330 --> 00:21:01.330
philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:08.330
by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:13.330
to solve this crisis and lay the basis

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.330
for a bright and optimistic human future.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.330
Let's do that. Thank you very much.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:48.330
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.330
that basically a design issue

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.330
on a voting form --

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.330
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.330
like that in the last eight years in a position

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.330
where you could make these things come true.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.330
That hurts.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:08.330
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.330
CA: When you look at what the leading candidates

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.330
in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:19.330
are you excited by their plans on global warming?

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.330
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.330
because, on the one hand, I think that

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.330
we should feel really great about the fact

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:47.330
that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.330
John McCain, and both of the finalists

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.330
for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.330
and forward-leaning position

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.330
on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.330
and all three are very different from the approach taken

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.330
by the current administration. And I think

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.330
that all three have also been responsible in

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:25.330
putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.330
as illustrated by the questions --

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.330
that was put together by the

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.330
League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.330
and, by the way, the debates have all been

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.330
sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.330
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.330
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.330
"Now, even lower emissions!"

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.330
The richness and fullness of the dialogue

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.330
in our democracy has not laid the basis

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.330
for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.330
So they're saying the right things and they may --

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.330
whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.330
but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:14.330
in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.330
that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.330
and then confronted the United States Senate,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:22.330
only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:29.330
to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.330
has to be laid alongside what the people say.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.330
This challenge is part of the fabric

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.330
of our whole civilization.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.330
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.330
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:54.330
requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.330
that is beyond what we have done in the past.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.330
So that's why I began by saying,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:05.330
be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.330
Demand -- change the light bulbs,

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.330
but change the laws. Change the global treaties.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:17.330
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:24.330
We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.330
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.330
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.330
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.330
have any new coal-fired generating plants

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.330
that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.330
quickly build these renewable sources.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.330
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.330
that between now and November, it is possible.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.330
This Alliance for Climate Protection

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.330
is going to launch a nationwide campaign --

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.330
grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.330
radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.330
from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.330
We need help. We need help.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.330
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.330
Al, is there something more than that

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.330
you would like to be doing?

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:22.330
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:27.330
to that question. What can I do?

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.330
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:36.330
of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.330
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.330
but again, not just with the light bulbs.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:51.330
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:57.330
We can change things, but we have to actively change.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:02.330
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.330
And that's hard to --

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.330
that's hard to create -- but it is coming.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.330
There's an old African proverb that some of you know

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.330
that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:23.330
if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.330
So we have to have a change in consciousness.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.330
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.330
A new appreciation for the privilege

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.330
that we have of undertaking this challenge.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.330
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.330
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
