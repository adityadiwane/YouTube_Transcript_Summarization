00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Humans have long held a fascination

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
for the human brain.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
We chart it, we've described it,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
we've drawn it,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
we've mapped it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Now just like the physical maps of our world

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
that have been highly influenced by technology --

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
think Google Maps,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
think GPS --

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
the same thing is happening for brain mapping

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
through transformation.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
So let's take a look at the brain.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
when someone shows you a brain."

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
And this outer layer, this is the vasculature,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
which is incredible, around a human brain.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
This is the blood vessels.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
20 percent of the oxygen

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
coming from your lungs,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
is servicing this one organ.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
That's basically, if you hold two fists together,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
it's just slightly larger than the two fists.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
learned that they could track blood flow

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
to map non-invasively

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
where activity was going on in the human brain.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
which is just turning around there.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
On the side here, this is temporal cortex.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This is the area where primary auditory processing --

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
so you're hearing my words,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
you're sending it up into higher language processing centers.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
Towards the front of the brain

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making --

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
it's the last to mature in late adulthood.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
It's the place where you're deciding right now

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So if you take a deeper look at the brain,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
what you can see

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
But there's actually a lot of structure there.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
It's cells and it's wires all wired together.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
So about a hundred years ago,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And that's shown here in the the very light blue.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
You can see areas

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
where neuronal cell bodies are being stained.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
So the outer part of that brain

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
is the neocortex.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
It's one continuous processing unit, if you will.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
But you can also see things underneath there as well.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And all of these blank areas

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
are the areas in which the wires are running through.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
They're probably less cell dense.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.260
So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
And as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
And how they're distributed really contributes

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
to their underlying function.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And of course, as I mentioned before,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
since we can now start to map brain function,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
we can start to tie these into the individual cells.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
So let's take a deeper look.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Let's look at neurons.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And the nerves themselves

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
are the ones who are receiving input.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
They're storing it, they're processing it.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Each neuron is connected via synapses

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
And each neuron itself

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
is largely unique.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
The unique character of both individual neurons

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
and neurons within a collection of the brain

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
are driven by fundamental properties

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
of their underlying biochemistry.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
These are proteins.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.260
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And they're controlling

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
basically everything that the nervous system has to do.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
all of those proteins

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
are encoded by our genomes.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
We get one from mom, one from dad.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
And on these chromosomes

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
are roughly 25,000 genes.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
They're encoded in the DNA.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And the nature of a given cell

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
driving its underlying biochemistry

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
are turned on

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260
and at what level they're turned on.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And so our project

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
is seeking to look at this readout,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
So in order to undertake such a project,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
we obviously need brains.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
So we sent our lab technician out.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
We were seeking normal human brains.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
What we actually start with

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
is a medical examiner's office.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
This a place where the dead are brought in.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
We are seeking normal human brains.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
We want to make sure

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
they died a somewhat natural death

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
with no injury to the brain,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
no history of psychiatric disease,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
no drugs on board --

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
we do a toxicology workup.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
And we're very careful

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
about the brains that we do take.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
We're also selecting for brains

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
in which we can get the tissue,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
we can get consent to take the tissue

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
within 24 hours of time of death.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA --

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
which is the readout from our genes --

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
is very labile,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and so we have to move very quickly.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
One side note on the collection of brains:

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
because of the way that we collect,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and because we require consent,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And men are much more likely

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
to have their significant other, spouse, give consent

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
than the other way around.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.260
(Laughter)

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
is we collect what's called an MR.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
So we collect this MR.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
The next thing we do

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
This maps the large cabling in the brain.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And again, you can think of this

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
The brain is removed from the skull,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
And those are frozen solid,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
and they're shipped to Seattle.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
And in Seattle, we take these --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
this is a whole human hemisphere --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
There's a blade here that's going to cut across

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
a section of the tissue

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
and transfer it to a microscope slide.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
and we scan it.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
And then what we get is our first mapping.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
So this is where experts come in

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and they make basic anatomic assignments.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
You could consider this state boundaries, if you will,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
those pretty broad outlines.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And this is just showing this here --

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
And remember, it's frozen.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260
And so you can see here,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.260
old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
We take a microscope slide.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260
This will then go onto a robot

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
that's going to apply one of those stains to it.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
So again this is what they can see under the microscope.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
You can see collections and configurations

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
of large and small cells

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
in clusters and various places.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
This is a more detailed map.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
Our scientists then use this

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
to go back to another piece of that tissue

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
So the technician takes the instructions.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
They scribe along a place there.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And then the laser actually cuts.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
You can see on the microscope slide here,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that's what's happening in real time.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
We take that tissue,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
we purify the RNA out of it

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
using some basic technology,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
and then we put a florescent tag on it.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
We take that tagged material

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
and we put it on to something called a microarray.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.260
but each one of these individual dots

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
is actually a unique piece of the human genome

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
that we spotted down on glass.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
so we repeatedly measure various genes

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
of the 25,000 genes in the genome.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
we get a unique fingerprint, if you will,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
Now we do this over and over again,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
this process for any given brain.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
It's involved in learning and memory.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And it contributes to about 70 samples

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
of those thousand samples.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
So each sample gets us about 50,000 data points

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
with repeat measurements, a thousand samples.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
So roughly, we have 50 million data points

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
for a given human brain.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
We've done right now

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
two human brains-worth of data.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
We've put all of that together

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
into one thing,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It's basically a large data set of information

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
that's all freely available to any scientist around the world.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
They don't even have to log in to come use this tool,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.260
mine this data, find interesting things out with this.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
So here's the modalities that we put together.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
it allows you to zoom in,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
it allows you to highlight individual structures.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
But most importantly,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
we're now mapping into this anatomic framework,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
So the red levels

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
And each gene gives us a fingerprint.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and have all of that data available.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
So what can scientists learn about this data?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
There's some basic things that you would want to understand.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
Two great examples are drugs,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
Prozac and Wellbutrin.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Now remember, we're assaying genes.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.260
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.260
Proteins are targets for drugs.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
So drugs bind to proteins

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and either turn them off, etc.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
So if you want to understand the action of drugs,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
and also in the ways you don't want them to.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
In the side effect profile, etc.,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
you want to see where those genes are turned on.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
And for the first time, we can actually do that.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
So now we can look throughout the brain.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
We can see this unique fingerprint.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
And we get confirmation.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on --

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
for something like Prozac,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.260
in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
but we also get to see the whole thing.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
and we see these genes turned on there.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
One other thing you can do with such a thing

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
because there's unique fingerprint,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
we can actually scan through the entire genome

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
and find other proteins

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
that show a similar fingerprint.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
So if you're in drug discovery, for example,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
you can go through

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.260
to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
Most of you are probably familiar

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
with genome-wide association studies

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
in the form of people covering in the news

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
which affect X."

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
And so these kinds of studies

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
are routinely published by scientists

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
and they're great. They analyze large populations.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
They look at their entire genomes,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and they try to find hot spots of activity

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.260
that are linked causally to genes.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
But what you get out of such an exercise

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
is simply a list of genes.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
And so it's very important for those researchers

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that we've created this resource.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
Now they can come in

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
and they can start to get clues about activity.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
They can start to look at common pathways --

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
other things that they simply haven't been able to do before.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
So I think this audience in particular

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
can understand the importance of individuality.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
And I think every human,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
we all have different genetic backgrounds,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
we all have lived separate lives.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260
But the fact is

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.260
We're similar at the genetic level.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
And what we're finding

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260
is actually, even at the brain biochemical level,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260
we are quite similar.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And so this shows it's not 99 percent,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
at a reasonable cutoff,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
And then we find some outliers,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
some things that lie beyond the cloud.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
And those genes are interesting,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
but they're very subtle.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
So I think it's an important message

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
to take home today

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.260
that even though we celebrate all of our differences,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
we are quite similar

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
even at the brain level.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
Now what do those differences look like?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
This is an example of a study that we did

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
to follow up and see what exactly those differences were --

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
and they're quite subtle.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.260
These are two genes that we found as good examples.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.260
One is called RELN -- it's involved in early developmental cues.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.260
DISC1 is a gene

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
that's deleted in schizophrenia.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
These aren't schizophrenic individuals,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
but they do show some population variation.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And so what you're looking at here

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
in donor one and donor four,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
which are the exceptions to the other two,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260
that genes are being turned on

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.260
in a very specific subset of cells.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.260
It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
that's telling us a gene is turned on there.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
Whether or not that's due

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
to an individual's genetic background or their experiences,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
we don't know.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.260
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
So I'm going to leave you with a final note

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260
about the complexity of the brain

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
and how much more we have to go.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
I think these resources are incredibly valuable.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
They give researchers a handle

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
on where to go.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.260
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
We're certainly going to be looking at more.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
I'll just close by saying

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
that the tools are there,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.260
This is the new frontier, if you will.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And so for those who are undaunted,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
but humbled by the complexity of the brain,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
the future awaits.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Thanks.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:15.260
(Applause)
