00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's very, very difficult

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to speak at the end of a conference like this,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of some of the things that have gone on here,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and take forward and work on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's what I'd like to try and do.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and saying it's not such a good thing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is what we usually see.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
through the conference right from the first day,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
about where we are now,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
about how the continent is doing much better.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So I'm not going to spend too much time --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
just to show you, refresh your memories

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
there really is a platform to build on.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We really do have it going right

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And inflation has come down.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
has come down dramatically.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You know, as you can see,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now this is a huge achievement.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because private investment flows have increased.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I want to remind you again --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I know you saw these statistics before --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but increasing dramatically.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And in many other countries this is happening.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
People are now confident to bring --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
it shows other people that, look,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
there is emerging confidence in your country.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's important that we build this platform,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
"Look, we must do something different."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Because we are confronted with a challenge.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What does this mean?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This means that we have to focus on how our youth

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You have to focus on how to create jobs,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and that they are creating the kind of productive environment

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in our countries that will make things happen.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And to support this, I just recently --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
one of the things I've done since leaving government

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
People don't have voice.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There is no way you can know what people want.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Like in every other country where this has been done,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
jobs is the top issue.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I want to leave this up here and come back to it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that now enables us to move forward --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and we mustn't make light of it.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We were going nowhere.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The economies were not growing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We were having negative per capita growth.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was not even there.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So now we have this platform we can build on.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is that it's been a simplistic debate.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And that's not what the debate should be about.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That's engaging in the wrong debate.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the private sector and ordinary African people

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
taking charge of their own lives?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
How do we combine all this?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that I talked about -- getting young people employed.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
much of what you have seen here.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We need to bring it back to say,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
what is the combination of all these factors

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And I want to tell you something.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
For me, the issue about aid --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and feel bad about aid.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Applause)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
including human, that built these countries today!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The issue is not that.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The issue is how are we using what has been given back.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
How are we using it?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Is it being directed effectively?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I want to tell you a little story.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We were on the Biafran side.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
but wherever we could help we did.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I'm sure some of you who are not so young

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
will remember those pictures.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Well, I was in the middle of it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We thought she was going to die.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
My father was not there.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
He was in the army.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So I was the oldest person in the house.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
My sister fell very ill with malaria.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
She was three years old and I was 15.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It didn't look like it was going to work.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
looking at people and giving them meds.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It was really hot. I was very hungry.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I got there and I saw huge crowds.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
with my sister strapped on my back,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
find a way to a window.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And while they were trying to break down the door,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This woman told me it was in the nick of time.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
In about two to three hours, she started to move.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
which was a good sign.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And then my sister woke up.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I strapped her on my back.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and she's a physician saving other lives.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
when it is you or your person involved --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
you don't care where -- whether it's aid.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You don't care what it is! (Applause)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You just want the person to be alive!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which some of the aid we get does on this continent --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
they are contributing productively into the economy.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
These are people who are productive agents in the economy.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
it means they can form the base of production for our economy.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And by the same token --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
their children will become a burden on the economy.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So even from an economic standpoint,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
if we leave the social and the humanitarian,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
we need to save lives now.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
let's channel these resources we get into something productive.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
You know, we have to use it well.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
What has happened in Europe?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Resources that were transferred to them --

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Infrastructure everywhere.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
has developed into a services economy.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
For which many people, even from other parts of the world,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
are going there to find jobs.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They used it to build an information superhighway,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
gain infrastructure that

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
enables them to participate in the

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
information technology revolution,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and to create jobs in their economy.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
When we ask them and tell them what we need,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and the EU.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
some of them in this audience, with private foundations.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And one day, these foundations have so much money,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
they will overtake the official aid that is being given.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
for what they are trying to do on the continent --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And they're also going from country to country,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and many times trying to find what to do.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
But I'm not really sure that their assistance

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
is also being channeled in the right way.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They are just discovering.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And many times I don't see Africans working with them.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
They are just going alone! (Applause)

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in hearing from Africans who might know.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
They want to visit us,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And now I'm maybe being harsh.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But I worry because this money is so important.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Now, who are they accountable to?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Are we on their boards when they make decisions

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
about where to channel money? Are we there?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
have they ever called these people together and said,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
"Look, your foundation and your foundation --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
you have so much money, we are grateful.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and where this aid should go."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Have we done that? The answer is no.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And each one is making their own individual effort.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and we would still have the same problems.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
This is what gives us the hopeless image.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
"Sit down."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and everybody else who is helping and say,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
As a continent, here are our priorities.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Here is where we want you to channel this money."

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Each one should not be an entrepreneur

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
going out and finding what is best.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Ten years from now we will have the same story,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and we will be repeating the same things.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So our problem right now is, how can we leverage

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
all this good will that is coming towards our way?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
How can we get government to combine properly

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
with these private foundations, with the international organizations,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and with our private sector.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But it cannot do it alone.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So why don't we think of using some of this aid?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
"Don't be shy about infrastructure.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
That education will work better

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Don't be shy of it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Invest some of your resources in that, too."

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And then we can see that this is one combination

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
of private, international, multilateral money,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
so that aid can be a facilitator.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
That is all aid can be.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
we would have failed.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and China is coming to take resources.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
If you tell them, "We need a road here,"

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
they will help you build it.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
They don't shy away from infrastructure.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
He said, "There are two things you need only.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
You are undisciplined." (Applause)

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And I repeat it for the continent.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
no, you can also provide that as well.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
But I'm saying it's not either or.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
One idea.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Second thing, for the private sector,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
people are afraid to take risks on the continent.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
to enable people to take risk?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
(Applause)

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Am I out of time?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
OK, so let me not forget my punchline.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000
to support women, to create jobs. (Applause)

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And we know, studies have shown

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
in fact, there's an econometric study,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
transfers into the hands of women result

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I'm not saying the men are not important --

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
They'll come back home and get disgruntled,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and it will result in difficulties we don't want.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
We don't want men beating their wives

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
because they don't have a job, and so on.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
because the reason is the men automatically --

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
But I want you to realize that resources

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
There are people creating jobs.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
She wants to expand.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
She needs another 20 million.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So take away from here is how are you going to put together

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
who are ready --

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
business people who want to expand and create more jobs.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And lastly, what are you going to do

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
and the African as an individual?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Thank you. (Applause)
