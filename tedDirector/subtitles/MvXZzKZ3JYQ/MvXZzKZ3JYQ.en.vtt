00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.896
Every weekend for as long
as I can remember,

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.953
my father would get up on a Saturday,

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:22.443
put on a worn sweatshirt

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.318
and he'd scrape away

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:27.165
at the squeaky old wheel
of a house that we lived in.

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.469
I wouldn't even call it restoration;

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:31.428
it was a ritual, catharsis.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.266
He would spend all year
scraping paint with this old heat gun

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.534
and a spackle knife,

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.635
and then he would repaint
where he scraped,

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.028
only to begin again the following year.

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:44.118
Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:47.632
the work of an old house
is never meant to be done.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.921
The day my father turned 52,
I got a phone call.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:54.367
My mother was on the line

00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:58.129
to tell me that doctors had found
a lump in his stomach --

00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:00.172
terminal cancer, she told me,

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.790
and he had been given
only three weeks to live.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.790
I immediately moved home
to Poughkeepsie, New York,

00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:10.222
to sit with my father on death watch,

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.638
not knowing what the next days
would bring us.

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:14.896
To keep myself distracted,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.674
I rolled up my sleeves,

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:20.603
and I went about finishing
what he could now no longer complete --

00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:23.019
the restoration of our old home.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.707
When that looming three-week deadline came

00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.889
and then went,

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:29.544
he was still alive.

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:31.386
And at three months,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.576
he joined me.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.576
We gutted and repainted the interior.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.894
At six months, the old windows
were refinished,

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:40.213
and at 18 months,

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:42.886
the rotted porch was finally replaced.

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.403
And there was my father,

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:48.680
standing with me outside,
admiring a day's work,

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:51.257
hair on his head, fully in remission,

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:53.961
when he turned to me and he said,

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.142
"You know, Michael,

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.115
this house saved my life."

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:03.360
So the following year, I decided
to go to architecture school.

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.317
(Laughter)

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.049
But there, I learned
something different about buildings.

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:10.704
Recognition seemed to come

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:14.279
to those who prioritized
novel and sculptural forms,

00:02:14.303 --> 00:02:16.775
like ribbons, or ...

00:02:17.514 --> 00:02:18.673
pickles?

00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:21.006
(Laughter)

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.357
And I think this
is supposed to be a snail.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.264
Something about this bothered me.

00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:32.914
Why was it that the best architects,
the greatest architecture --

00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:35.540
all beautiful and visionary
and innovative --

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.249
is also so rare,

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:40.720
and seems to serve so very few?

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:43.212
And more to the point:

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:46.691
With all of this creative talent,
what more could we do?

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.865
Just as I was about to start
my final exams,

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.589
I decided to take a break
from an all-nighter

00:02:54.018 --> 00:02:56.930
and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:00.510
a leading health activist
for the global poor.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:04.316
I was surprised to hear a doctor
talking about architecture.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.822
Buildings are making
people sicker, he said,

00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:08.639
and for the poorest in the world,

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:11.559
this is causing epidemic-level problems.

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:13.553
In this hospital in South Africa,

00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:15.761
patients that came in
with, say, a broken leg,

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.381
to wait in this unventilated hallway,

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:22.932
walked out with a multidrug-resistant
strand of tuberculosis.

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:26.918
Simple designs for infection control
had not been thought about,

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.460
and people had died because of it.

00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:33.164
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:35.693
If hospitals are making people sicker,

00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:37.621
where are the architects and designers

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:42.255
to help us build and design
hospitals that allow us to heal?

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:46.126
That following summer,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.952
I was in the back of a Land Rover
with a few classmates,

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:52.457
bumping over the mountainous
hillside of Rwanda.

00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:56.933
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro
in this old guesthouse,

00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:00.154
which was a jail after the genocide.

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:04.888
I was there to design and build
a new type of hospital

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.106
with Dr. Farmer and his team.

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:10.099
If hallways are making patients sicker,

00:04:10.123 --> 00:04:13.877
what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.219
and makes people walk in the exterior?

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:18.612
If mechanical systems rarely work,

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:21.219
what if we could design a hospital
that could breathe

00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:23.119
through natural ventilation,

00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:26.285
and meanwhile reduce
its environmental footprint?

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.865
And what about the patients' experience?

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.205
Evidence shows
that a simple view of nature

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.388
can radically improve health outcomes,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.814
So why couldn't we design a hospital

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:38.551
where every patient
had a window with a view?

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:43.987
Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:46.547
Designing it is one thing;

00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.797
getting it built, we learned,
is quite another.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:52.303
We worked with Bruce Nizeye,

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:53.840
a brilliant engineer,

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:55.988
and he thought about
construction differently

00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:57.868
than I had been taught in school.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.782
When we had to excavate
this enormous hilltop

00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:03.741
and a bulldozer was expensive
and hard to get to site,

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:06.285
Bruce suggested doing it by hand,

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.983
using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"

00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:12.556
which means "community works
for the community."

00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:16.406
Hundreds of people came
with shovels and hoes,

00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:18.795
and we excavated that hill

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.428
in half the time and half
the cost of that bulldozer.

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:26.268
Instead of importing furniture,
Bruce started a guild,

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.699
and he brought in
master carpenters to train others

00:05:28.723 --> 00:05:30.477
in how to make furniture by hand.

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:32.071
And on this job site,

00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:35.584
15 years after the Rwandan genocide,

00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:39.931
Bruce insisted that we bring on
labor from all backgrounds,

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:41.867
and that half of them be women.

00:05:42.302 --> 00:05:44.947
Bruce was using
the process of building to heal,

00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:46.956
not just for those who were sick,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.678
but for the entire community as a whole.

00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:55.941
We call this the locally fabricated
way of building, or "lo-fab,"

00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:58.321
and it has four pillars:

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.158
hire locally,

00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:01.617
source regionally,

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:03.531
train where you can

00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:05.119
and most importantly,

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:08.705
think about every design decision
as an opportunity

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.645
to invest in the dignity
of the places where you serve.

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.049
Think of it like the local food movement,

00:06:16.073 --> 00:06:17.428
but for architecture.

00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:19.944
And we're convinced
that this way of building

00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:21.906
can be replicated across the world,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.477
and change the way we talk about
and evaluate architecture.

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.207
Using the lo-fab way of building,

00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:33.027
even aesthetic decisions
can be designed to impact people's lives.

00:06:33.762 --> 00:06:36.464
In Butaro, we chose to use
a local volcanic stone

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:38.516
found in abundance within the area,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.577
but often considered
a nuisance by farmers,

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.330
and piled on the side of the road.

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:45.155
We worked with these masons
to cut these stones

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:48.370
and form them into the walls
of the hospital.

00:06:48.394 --> 00:06:50.591
And when they began on this corner

00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:53.703
and wrapped around the entire hospital,

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.805
they were so good at putting
these stones together,

00:06:56.829 --> 00:07:00.441
they asked us if they could take down
the original wall and rebuild it.

00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:02.753
And you see what is possible.

00:07:03.467 --> 00:07:04.700
It's beautiful.

00:07:05.794 --> 00:07:07.673
And the beauty, to me,

00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:10.915
comes from the fact that I know
that hands cut these stones,

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:14.420
and they formed them into this thick wall,

00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:18.434
made only in this place
with rocks from this soil.

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:24.208
When you go outside today
and you look at your built world,

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:26.154
ask not only:

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:29.404
"What is the environmental footprint?" --
an important question --

00:07:29.428 --> 00:07:30.702
but what if we also asked,

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:34.382
"What is the human handprint
of those who made it?"

00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:39.071
We started a new practice
based around these questions,

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:41.644
and we tested it around the world.

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:43.618
Like in Haiti,

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:48.241
where we asked if a new hospital
could help end the epidemic of cholera.

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:50.394
In this 100-bed hospital,

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:52.093
we designed a simple strategy

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:56.577
to clean contaminated medical waste
before it enters the water table,

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.609
and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.163
are already saving lives because of it.

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:02.382
Or Malawi:

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:05.635
we asked if a birthing center
could radically reduce

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:07.559
maternal and infant mortality.

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:11.145
Malawi has one of the highest rates
of maternal and infant death

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:12.386
in the world.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.733
Using a simple strategy
to be replicated nationally,

00:08:15.757 --> 00:08:17.977
we designed a birthing center

00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:20.309
that would attract women
and their attendants

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.166
to come to the hospital earlier
and therefore have safer births.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:26.243
Or in the Congo, where we asked

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.515
if an educational center
could also be used

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:30.721
to protect endangered wildlife.

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:32.330
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat

00:08:32.354 --> 00:08:35.901
is leading to global epidemic,
disease transfer and war.

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:39.147
In one of the hardest-to-reach
places in the world,

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.097
we used the mud and the dirt
and the wood around us

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:43.785
to construct a center

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:48.557
that would show us ways to protect
and conserve our rich biodiversity.

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.131
Even here in the US,

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.418
we were asked to rethink

00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:56.504
the largest university for the deaf
and hard of hearing in the world.

00:08:56.844 --> 00:08:59.100
The deaf community, through sign language,

00:08:59.124 --> 00:09:01.534
shows us the power
of visual communication.

00:09:01.558 --> 00:09:03.810
We designed a campus
that would awaken the ways

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.883
in which we as humans all communicate,

00:09:05.907 --> 00:09:07.826
both verbally and nonverbally.

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:12.263
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.826
we thought about old
industrial infrastructure.

00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:17.473
We wondered:

00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:22.060
Could we use arts and culture
and design to revitalize this city

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.706
and other Rust Belt cities
across our nation,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.694
and turn them into centers
for innovation and growth?

00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:31.550
In each of these projects,
we asked a simple question:

00:09:32.045 --> 00:09:34.224
What more can architecture do?

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.606
And by asking that question,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.372
we were forced to consider
how we could create jobs,

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.807
how we could source regionally

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:46.057
and how we could invest
in the dignity of the communities

00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.312
in which we serve.

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.206
I have learned

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:54.498
that architecture can be
a transformative engine for change.

00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:59.790
About a year ago, I read an article

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:04.711
about a tireless and intrepid
civil rights leader

00:10:05.328 --> 00:10:06.634
named Bryan Stevenson.

00:10:08.423 --> 00:10:12.420
(Applause)

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:17.433
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.572
He and his team had been documenting

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:24.240
the over 4,000 lynchings
of African-Americans

00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:26.524
that have happened in the American South.

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:31.699
And they had a plan to mark every county
where these lynchings occurred,

00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:35.112
and build a national memorial
to the victims of lynching

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.826
in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:40.976
Countries like Germany and South Africa

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.049
and, of course, Rwanda,

00:10:43.073 --> 00:10:46.145
have found it necessary to build memorials

00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:49.008
to reflect on the atrocities
of their past,

00:10:49.032 --> 00:10:52.020
in order to heal their national psyche.

00:10:52.044 --> 00:10:55.212
We have yet to do this
in the United States.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:11:03.314
So I sent a cold email
to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:

00:11:03.338 --> 00:11:05.287
"Dear Bryan," it said,

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:07.738
"I think your building project

00:11:07.762 --> 00:11:10.717
is maybe the most important
project we could do in America

00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:13.731
and could change the way
we think about racial injustice.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.624
By any chance,

00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:18.569
do you know who will design it?"

00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:20.222
(Laughter)

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:22.511
Surprisingly, shockingly,

00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:24.861
Bryan got right back to me,

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:28.093
and invited me down to meet
with his team and talk to them.

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:30.815
Needless to say,
I canceled all my meetings

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.179
and I jumped on a plane
to Montgomery, Alabama.

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:34.361
When I got there,

00:11:34.797 --> 00:11:38.281
Bryan and his team picked me up,
and we walked around the city.

00:11:38.305 --> 00:11:40.632
And they took the time to point out

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:43.677
the many markers that have
been placed all over the city

00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:46.145
to the history of the Confederacy,

00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:50.396
and the very few that mark
the history of slavery.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.247
And then he walked me to a hill.

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:54.330
It overlooked the whole city.

00:11:54.934 --> 00:11:57.164
He pointed out the river
and the train tracks

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.883
where the largest domestic
slave-trading port in America

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:01.091
had once prospered.

00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:02.733
And then to the Capitol rotunda,

00:12:02.757 --> 00:12:04.829
where George Wallace
had stood on its steps

00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:07.737
and proclaimed, "Segregation forever."

00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:10.056
And then to the very hill below us.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.397
He said, "Here we will build
a new memorial

00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:17.863
that will change the identity
of this city and of this nation."

00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:22.309
Our two teams have worked
together over the last year

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:23.975
to design this memorial.

00:12:27.184 --> 00:12:30.051
The memorial will take us on a journey

00:12:30.836 --> 00:12:33.910
through a classical,
almost familiar building type,

00:12:33.934 --> 00:12:38.059
like the Parthenon
or the colonnade at the Vatican.

00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:40.321
But as we enter,

00:12:40.345 --> 00:12:44.306
the ground drops below us
and our perception shifts,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.424
where we realize that these columns
evoke the lynchings,

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:50.479
which happened in the public square.

00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:52.321
And as we continue,

00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:55.440
we begin to understand the vast number

00:12:55.464 --> 00:12:58.457
of those who have yet to be put to rest.

00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:03.186
Their names will be engraved
on the markers that hang above us.

00:13:04.202 --> 00:13:08.271
And just outside will be a field
of identical columns.

00:13:08.973 --> 00:13:12.772
But these are temporary columns,
waiting in purgatory,

00:13:12.796 --> 00:13:16.619
to be placed in the very counties
where these lynchings occurred.

00:13:18.124 --> 00:13:20.496
Over the next few years,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.506
this site will bear witness,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.298
as each of these markers is claimed

00:13:25.322 --> 00:13:27.581
and visibly placed in those counties.

00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:33.426
Our nation will begin to heal
from over a century of silence.

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:37.852
When we think about
how it should be built,

00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:40.676
we were reminded of Ubudehe,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.068
the building process
we learned about in Rwanda.

00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:46.106
We wondered if we could fill
those very columns

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.029
with the soil from the sites
of where these killings occurred.

00:13:51.218 --> 00:13:54.382
Brian and his team have begun
collecting that soil

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.724
and preserving it in individual jars

00:13:57.748 --> 00:14:01.207
with family members, community
leaders and descendants.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.992
The act of collecting soil itself

00:14:06.148 --> 00:14:08.818
has lead to a type of spiritual healing.

00:14:09.545 --> 00:14:12.032
It's an act of restorative justice.

00:14:12.844 --> 00:14:15.398
As one EJI team member noted

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:19.474
in the collection of the soil
from where Will McBride was lynched,

00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:23.364
"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,

00:14:23.388 --> 00:14:24.743
one drop of blood,

00:14:25.173 --> 00:14:26.576
one hair follicle --

00:14:26.964 --> 00:14:28.585
I pray that I dug it up,

00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:31.584
and that his whole body
would be at peace."

00:14:34.683 --> 00:14:37.944
We plan to break ground
on this memorial later this year,

00:14:37.968 --> 00:14:42.413
and it will be a place to finally speak
of the unspeakable acts

00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:44.292
that have scarred this nation.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:52.241
(Applause)

00:14:57.245 --> 00:15:00.682
When my father told me
that day that this house --

00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:01.861
our house --

00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:03.090
had saved his life,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.282
what I didn't know

00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:08.558
was that he was referring
to a much deeper relationship

00:15:08.582 --> 00:15:11.022
between architecture and ourselves.

00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:14.995
Buildings are not simply
expressive sculptures.

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:19.117
They make visible our personal
and our collective aspirations

00:15:19.141 --> 00:15:20.298
as a society.

00:15:21.177 --> 00:15:24.417
Great architecture can give us hope.

00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:27.536
Great architecture can heal.

00:15:28.478 --> 00:15:29.695
Thank you very much.

00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:36.990
(Applause)
