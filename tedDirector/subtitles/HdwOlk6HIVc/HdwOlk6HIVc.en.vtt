00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
We live in difficult and challenging

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
economic times, of course.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And one of the first victims

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
of difficult economic times,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I think, is public spending of any kind,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
but certainly in the firing line at the moment

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
is public spending for science,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and particularly curiosity-led science

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
and exploration.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
that that's a ridiculous

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
and ludicrous thing to do.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
But I think to set the scene,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
but it is a bit of a mess.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
(Laughter)

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
of how much science costs.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
Because, if I'm going to make the case

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
I should tell you how much it costs.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
So this is a game called "spot the science budgets."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
This is the U.K. government spend.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
The science budget is actually --

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and then yellow set of blobs.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
And it's one of the yellow set of blobs

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
around the big yellow blob.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
out of 620 billion.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
That funds everything in the U.K.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
from medical research, space exploration,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
engineering, even arts and humanities,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
funded from the science budget,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So that's what we're arguing about.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
That percentage, by the way, is about the same

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
in the U.S. and Germany and France.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
R&amp;D in total in the economy,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
publicly funded, is about

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
0.6 percent of GDP.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
So that's what we're arguing about.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
The first thing I want to say,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
This is a picture that actually was sent back

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
by the Cassini space probe around Saturn,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
So it isn't in the series.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
It's of the moon Enceladus.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
So that big sweeping, white

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
sphere in the corner is Saturn,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
which is actually in the background of the picture.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
which is about as big as the British Isles.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
So, tiny moon.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
What's fascinating and beautiful ...

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
What's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
some faint, sort of,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
wisps of almost smoke

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
rising up from the limb.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
It's a beautiful graphic.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
What we found out were that those faint wisps

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
are actually fountains of ice

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
but we think that the mechanism

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
for powering those fountains

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
requires there to be lakes of liquid water

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
beneath the surface of this moon.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And what's important about that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
is that, on our planet, on Earth,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
wherever we find liquid water,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
we find life.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So, to find strong evidence

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
750 million miles away from the Earth

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
is really quite astounding.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So what we're saying, essentially,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
That's one more picture of Enceladus.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
So it made a very low pass,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
absolutely beautiful.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
That's probably this place,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
to get any sense that this moon, as most moons,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
was anything other than a dead ball of rock.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
It's actually an ice moon.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
But by measuring the way that

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
Europa interacts

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
with the magnetic field of Jupiter,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
and looking at how those cracks in the ice

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.260
that you can see there on that graphic move around,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
we've inferred very strongly

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
the entire surface of Europa.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
there's more water on that moon of Jupiter

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
is probably the prime candidate

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
for finding life on a moon

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
Our exploration of the solar system

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
It may also have pointed the way to answering

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Is there any other use to exploration and science,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
other than just a sense of wonder?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
Well, there is.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
This is a very famous picture

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
December 24th, 1968,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
when I was about eight months old.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
It was taken by Apollo 8

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
as it went around the back of the moon.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
Earthrise from Apollo 8.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
that saved 1968,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.260
which was a turbulent year --

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
the student riots in Paris,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
the height of the Vietnam War.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
The reason many people think that about this picture,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
is that this picture, arguably, was

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
the beginning of the environmental movement.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Because, for the first time,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
we saw our world,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
not as a solid, immovable,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
kind of indestructible place,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
but as a very small, fragile-looking world

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.260
just hanging against the blackness of space.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
What's also not often said

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
about the space exploration, about the Apollo program,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
is the economic contribution it made.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.260
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
and a tremendous achievement

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and delivered pictures like this,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
it cost a lot, didn't it?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Well, actually, many studies have been done

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
about the economic effectiveness,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
the economic impact of Apollo.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
14 came back into the U.S. economy.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
So the Apollo program paid for itself

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
in inspiration,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
in engineering, achievement

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
14 times over.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
So exploration can pay for itself.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
What about scientific discovery?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
What about driving innovation?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
What it is, is a picture of the spectrum

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
of hydrogen.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
See, back in the 1880s, 1890s,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
many scientists, many observers,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
looked at the light given off from atoms.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
And they saw strange pictures like this.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
like a white light,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
it just emits light at particular colors,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
because the way that's explained

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
is atoms are a single nucleus

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
with electrons going around them.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And the electrons can only be in particular places.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
And when they jump up to the next place they can be,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
and fall back down again,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
they emit light at particular colors.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
only emit light at very specific colors,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
was one of the key drivers

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
that led to the development of the quantum theory,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
the theory of the structure of atoms.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
absorbing light.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
And again, they only absorb light at particular colors

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
when electrons jump up and fall down,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
jump up and fall down.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.260
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And the element helium

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
because some of those black lines were found

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
that corresponded to no known element.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
And that's why helium's called helium.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
Now, that sounds esoteric,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
but the quantum theory quickly led

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260
to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
like silicon, for example.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
The way that silicon behaves,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
the fact that you can build transistors,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
is a purely quantum phenomenon.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
So without that curiosity-driven

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
understanding of the structure of atoms,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260
then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
we wouldn't have pretty much the basis

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
of our modern economy.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
There's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
In "Wonders of the Solar System,"

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
is you can transport it, not only to the planets,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
but to the most distant stars and galaxies.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And one of the astonishing predictions

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
of quantum mechanics,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
just by looking at the structure of atoms --

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
the same theory that describes transistors --

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260
is that there can be no stars in the universe

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
that have reached the end of their life

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
get a telescope, swing it to the sky,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
and you find that there are no dead stars

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.260
That's quite an incredible prediction.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
Well, this is a picture of it.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
with, what, 100 billion

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
stars like our Sun in it.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
There are a billion stars in the galactic core,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
which is why it's shining out so brightly.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
This is about 50 million light years away,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
so one of our neighboring galaxies.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
But that bright star there

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
So that star is also

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
50 million light years away.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
as the center of the galaxy

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
with a billion suns in it.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
Now that's an incredible phenomena,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
because it's a star that sits there.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
And it has a binary companion that goes around it,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
so a big star, a big ball of gas.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
And what it does is it sucks gas

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260
off its companion star,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and then it explodes.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
as a billion suns for about two weeks,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
and releases, not only energy,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
in the universe at the Big Bang.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
throughout the first generation of stars.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
It was made in stars like that,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
locked away and then returned to the universe

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
in explosions like that

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.260
in order to recondense into planets,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
stars, new solar systems

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and, indeed, people like us.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and beauty and universality of the laws of physics,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
because we understand that process,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
because we understand

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
the structure of atoms here on Earth.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
This is a beautiful quote that I found --

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming:

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
"When I woke up just after dawn

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
on September 28, 1928,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
by discovering the world's first antibiotic."

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
Now, the explorers of the world of the atom

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
did not intend to invent the transistor.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
And they certainly didn't intend to

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
describe the mechanics of supernova explosions,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
which eventually told us where

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
the building blocks of life

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
were synthesized in the universe.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
So, I think science can be --

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
serendipity is important.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.260
It can also, I think, finally

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
reveal the most profound

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
ideas to us

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
about our place in the universe

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
and really the value of our home planet.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.260
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
But it's a famous picture, not because of

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
but actually because of a tiny, faint blob

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
just hanging underneath one of the rings.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
And if I blow it up there, you see it.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.260
It looks like a moon,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.260
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
I think the Earth has got a strange property

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
that the farther away you get from it,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
the more beautiful it seems.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.260
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
The Voyager is a tiny machine.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260
transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
and we're still in contact with it.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.260
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
Uranus and Neptune.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And after it visited all four of those planets,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
had the wonderful idea

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
of turning Voyager around

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.260
and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And it took this picture of Earth.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
That's Earth from four billion miles away.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And I'd like to read you what

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.260
Sagan wrote about it, just to finish,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
because I cannot say words as beautiful as this

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.260
to describe what he saw

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
in that picture that he had taken.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
He said, "Consider again that dot.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260
That's here. That's home. That's us.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
On it, everyone you love,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
every human being who ever was

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
lived out their lives.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
The aggregates of joy and suffering

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
thousands of confident religions,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.260
ideologies and economic doctrines,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.260
every creator and destroyer of civilization,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.260
every king and peasant, every young couple in love,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
every mother and father, hopeful child,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
inventor and explorer,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
every superstar, every supreme leader,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
every saint and sinner in the history of our species,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
lived there, on a mote of dust,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
suspended in a sunbeam.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.260
and character-building experience.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
There is perhaps no better demonstration

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
of the folly of human conceits

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
than this distant image of our tiny world.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
To me, it underscores our responsibility

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
to deal more kindly with one another

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.260
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
the only home we've ever known."

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
Beautiful words about

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
the power of science and exploration.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
that we know enough about the universe.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
Surely, we know enough.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
We don't need to discover anything else about our universe.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Let me leave the last words to someone

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
He was clearly under assault all the time.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
Just exploit it; just build things."

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.260
to the progress of the human mind

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.260
than to presume that our views of science

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.260
are ultimate,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
that our triumphs are complete,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
that there are no mysteries in nature,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.260
and that there are no new worlds to conquer."
