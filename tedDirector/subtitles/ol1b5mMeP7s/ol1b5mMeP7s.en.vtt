00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:15.108
I want to talk to you about one thing

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:16.864
and just one thing only,

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:20.620
and this has to do with when people ask me,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.867
what do you do?

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:25.767
To which I usually respond,

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.907
I do computer music.

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:30.852
Now, a number of people

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:33.089
just stop talking to me right then and there,

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.502
and the rest who are left usually have

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.750
this blank look in their eye,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.919
as if to say, what does that mean?

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:42.137
And I feel like I'm actually depriving them

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:45.342
of information by telling them this,

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:47.070
at which point I usually panic

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.660
and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.442
which is, I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:54.054
Which is true.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.910
That's usually followed by a second thought,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
which is, whatever it is that I'm doing,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.902
I love it.

00:01:01.902 --> 00:01:05.699
And today, I want to, well,

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.870
share with you something I love,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.354
and also why.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:13.283
And I think we'll begin with just this question:

00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:14.620
What is computer music?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.400
And I'm going to try to do my
best to provide a definition,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.131
maybe by telling you a story

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.778
that goes through some of the stuff

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:23.704
I've been working on.

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:25.516
And the first thing, I think, in our story

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:28.064
is going to be something called ChucK.

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:33.437
Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:36.146
and it's open-source, it's freely available,

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:38.066
and I like to think that it crashes equally well

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.410
on all modern operating systems.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.370
And instead of telling you more about it,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.196
I'm just going to give you a demo.

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:46.352
By the way, I'm just going to nerd out

00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:47.981
for just a few minutes here,

00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:50.779
so I would say, don't freak out.

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.850
In fact, I would invite all of you to join me

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.034
in just geeking out.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:57.096
If you've never written a line
of code before in your life,

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:58.282
do not worry.

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:01.799
I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.218
First thing I'm going to do is to make

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:05.051
a sine wave oscillator,

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:08.085
and we're going to called the sine wave generator

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:10.847
"Ge."

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:12.937
And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:14.091
Now this is kind of the abstraction

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.699
for the sound output on my computer. Okay?

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.899
So I've connected myself into the speaker.

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.491
Next, I'm going to say my frequency

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:23.459
is 440 hertz,

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.278
and I'm going to let time advance

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:30.000
by two seconds through this operation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.068
All right, so if I were to play this --

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:36.740
(Tone) —

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.161
you would hear a sine wave
at 440 hertz for two seconds.

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:42.187
Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:43.931
and then just change some of these numbers,

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:47.891
220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,

00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:50.331
and .5 and 880.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:51.693
By doubling the frequency,

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:54.210
we're actually going up in successive octaves,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.547
and then we have this sequence --

00:02:55.547 --> 00:02:57.674
(Tones) — of tones.

00:02:57.674 --> 00:02:59.580
Okay, great, now I can imagine creating

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.022
all kinds of really horrible

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:03.420
single sine wave pieces of music with this,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.332
but I'm going to do something
that computers are really good at,

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.156
which is repetition.

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:09.860
I'm going to put this all in a while loop,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.156
and you actually don't need to indent,

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:13.280
but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.884
It's good practice.

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:16.464
And when we do this —

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:20.961
(Tones) —

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:22.134
that's going to go on for a while.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:23.628
In fact, it's probably not going to stop

00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:25.411
until this computer disintegrates.

00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:28.110
And I can't really empirically prove that to you,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.779
but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.655
Next, I'm going to replace this 220

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:36.461
by math.random2f.

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.739
I'm going to generate a random number

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.879
between 30 and 1,000 and send that

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.965
to the frequency of me.

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.065
And I'm going to do this every half a second.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:48.007
(Tones)

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:50.668
Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:55.290
(Tones)

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.745
One hundred.

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:58.357
(Tones)

00:03:58.357 --> 00:03:59.591
All right.

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:01.535
At this point, we've reached something

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:02.605
that I would like to think of as

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:06.626
the canonical computer music.

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:10.443
This is, to me, the sound that mainframes

00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:11.565
are supposed to be making

00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:14.807
when they're thinking really hard.

00:04:14.807 --> 00:04:16.900
It's this sound, it's like,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.471
the square root of five million.

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:26.211
So is this computer music?

00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:28.190
Yeah, I guess by definition,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.395
it's kind of computer music.

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:32.403
It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:33.891
cruising down the highway,

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:38.907
but it's a foundation of computer-generated music,

00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:41.110
and using ChucK,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.803
we've actually been building instruments

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:44.699
in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.900
based right here at Stanford Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.683
Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,

00:04:51.683 --> 00:04:54.312
humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:55.909
Now the reason we have these

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.379
is so that for the instruments that we create

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.603
out of the laptop, we want the sound to come

00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:03.123
out of somewhere near the instrument

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:04.491
and the performer,

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:07.193
kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.

00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:09.079
Like, if I were to play a violin here,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.190
the sound would naturally not come out of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.964
the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.

00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:17.171
So these speakers are meant to emulate that.

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.500
In fact, I'm going to show you

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.243
how we actually built them.

00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:23.307
The first step is to go to IKEA

00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:24.687
and buy a salad bowl.

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:27.917
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:29.415
That's the actual name,

00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:30.837
and I actually use one of these

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:33.065
to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:36.236
And the first step is you turn it upside down,

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.711
and then you drill holes in them,

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.220
six holes per hemi,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.934
and then make a base plate,

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.614
put car speaker drivers in them

00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:48.205
along with amplifiers in the enclosure,

00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:49.559
and you put that all together and you have

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.333
these hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:52.896
Add people, add laptops,

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:55.584
you have a laptop orchestra.

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:59.114
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?

00:05:59.114 --> 00:06:01.033
Well, let me give you a demonstration

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:04.268
of about 200 instruments we've created so far

00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:07.511
for the Laptop Orchestra.

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:09.938
And what I'm going to do is
actually come over to this thing.

00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:12.143
This thing I have in front of me

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:15.355
actually used to be a commodity gaming controller

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:17.145
called a Gametrak.

00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:19.021
This thing actually has a glove
you can put on your hands.

00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:20.581
It's tethered to the base,

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.110
and this will track the position of your hands

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.163
in real time.

00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:27.537
It was originally designed as a golfing controller

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:29.453
to detect the motion of your swing.

00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:31.984
That turned out to be a rather large

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:33.688
commercial non-success,

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:37.442
at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,

00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:39.450
at which point computer music researchers

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.508
said, "This is awesome!

00:06:41.508 --> 00:06:44.257
We can prototype instruments out of this."

00:06:44.257 --> 00:06:47.201
So let me show you one instrument we've created,

00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:49.113
one of many, and this instrument

00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:50.682
is called "Twilight,"

00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:53.368
and it's meant to go with this metaphor

00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:56.401
of pulling a sound out of the ground.

00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:59.752
So let me see if this will work.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:06.188
(Music)

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:10.791
And put it back.

00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.886
And then if you go to the left,

00:07:14.886 --> 00:07:17.381
right,

00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:25.231
it sounds like an elephant in pain.

00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:28.259
This is a slightly metallic sound.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.613
Turn it just a bit.

00:07:31.613 --> 00:07:34.569
(Music)

00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:40.785
It's like a hovering car.

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:45.799
Okay.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.965
This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.911
let me turn it up.

00:07:56.915 --> 00:08:01.710
(Music)

00:08:02.068 --> 00:08:03.948
So it's a slightly different interaction.

00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:06.902
The fourth one is a drone.

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:12.760
(Music)

00:08:20.613 --> 00:08:23.319
And finally, let's see,

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:25.130
this is a totally different interaction,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.940
and I think you have to imagine that there's

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.872
this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,

00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:32.315
and I'm going to bang it.

00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:36.902
(Drum)

00:08:36.902 --> 00:08:39.689
(Laughter)

00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:42.685
So there we go, so that's one of many instruments

00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:44.455
in the Laptop Orchestra.

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:48.009
(Applause)

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:50.290
Thank you.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.396
And when you put that together,

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:56.464
you get something that sounds like this.

00:08:56.464 --> 00:09:03.123
(Music)

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.820
Okay, and so, I think from the experience

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.343
of building a lot of instruments
for the Laptop Orchestra,

00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:52.847
and I think from the curiosity of wondering,

00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:54.350
what if we took these

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.942
hopefully expressive instruments

00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:58.575
and we brought it to a lot of people,

00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:00.982
plus then a healthy bout of insanity —

00:10:00.982 --> 00:10:02.471
put those three things together —

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:05.987
led to me actually co-founding a startup company

00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:08.446
in 2008 called Smule.

00:10:08.446 --> 00:10:10.366
Now Smule's mission is to create

00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:14.223
expressive, mobile music things,

00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:18.985
and one of the first musical instruments

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.845
we created is called Ocarina.

00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:23.610
And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.

00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:29.650
So Ocarina —

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.248
(Music) —

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:36.371
is based on this ancient flute-like instrument

00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:37.780
called the ocarina,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.163
and this one is the four-hole
English pendant configuration,

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:44.566
and you're literally blowing into the microphone

00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:47.492
to make the sound.

00:10:47.492 --> 00:10:49.125
And there's actually a little ChucK script

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:50.293
running in here that's detecting

00:10:50.293 --> 00:10:51.775
the strength of your blowing

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:53.893
and also synthesizing the sound.

00:10:53.893 --> 00:10:57.478
(Music)

00:10:57.478 --> 00:11:00.808
And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,

00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:02.461
so you can get —

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.790
(Music)

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.500
All right. So let me play a little ditty for you,

00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:13.349
a little Bach.

00:11:13.349 --> 00:11:15.941
And here, you'll hear a little
accompaniment with the melody.

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.509
The accompaniment actually follows the melody,

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:22.290
not the other way around.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.625
(Music)

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:36.789
And this was designed

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:38.065
to let you take your time

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:41.270
and figure out where your expressive space is,

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.077
and you can just hang out here

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:46.139
for a while, for a really
dramatic effect, if you want,

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:49.205
and whenever you're ready —

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:53.857
(Music)

00:12:04.981 --> 00:12:06.089
And on these longer notes,

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:08.190
I'm going to use more vibrato

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.082
towards the end of the notes

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:12.134
to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.

00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:15.750
(Music)

00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:23.160
Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.581
(Applause)

00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:29.841
Thank you.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.746
So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:40.493
is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.502
but for me, I think the more important question is,

00:12:42.502 --> 00:12:44.043
is it expressive?

00:12:44.043 --> 00:12:46.117
And at the same time, I think

00:12:46.117 --> 00:12:47.421
creating these types of instruments

00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:50.783
asks a question about the role of technology,

00:12:50.783 --> 00:12:52.477
and its place for how we make music.

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:54.214
Apparently, for example,

00:12:54.214 --> 00:12:56.120
not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago —

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.640
that's not that long in the course of human history —

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.621
families back then

00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.509
used to make music together

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.557
as a common form of entertainment.

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:05.802
I don't think that's really happening

00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:07.337
that much anymore.

00:13:07.337 --> 00:13:09.007
You know, this is before radio, before recording.

00:13:09.007 --> 00:13:11.214
In the last hundred years, with all this technology,

00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:13.388
we now have more access to music

00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:15.021
as listeners and consumers,

00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:18.084
but somehow, I think we're making less music

00:13:18.084 --> 00:13:19.770
than ever before.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.401
I'm not sure why that would be.

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.050
Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.509
And while listening to music is wonderful,

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:29.918
there's a special joy to making music

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:31.573
that's all its own.

00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:32.836
And I think that's one part

00:13:32.836 --> 00:13:34.926
of the goal of why I do what I do

00:13:34.926 --> 00:13:39.682
is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.462
Now, if that's one goal, the other goal

00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:42.892
is to look to the future and think about

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:45.229
what kind of new musical things can we make

00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:47.822
that we don't perhaps yet have names for

00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:50.685
that's enabled by technology, but ultimately

00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:53.126
might change the way that humans make music.

00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:55.498
And I'll just give you one example here,

00:13:55.498 --> 00:14:01.723
and this is Ocarina's other feature.

00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:03.910
This is a globe,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.683
and here you're actually listening

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:08.735
to other users of Ocarina

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:12.715
blow into their iPhones to play something.

00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:17.568
This is "G.I.R." from Texas,

00:14:17.568 --> 00:14:23.501
"R.I.K." I don't know why it's these
three-letter names today, Los Angeles.

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:28.519
They're all playing pretty,

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:31.879
somewhat minimal music here.

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:37.327
(Music)

00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:39.933
And the idea with this is that, well,

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:43.850
technology should not be foregrounded here,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.933
and — (Laughter) —

00:14:45.933 --> 00:14:48.646
we've actually opened this up.

00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:50.153
The first thought is that, hey, you know

00:14:50.153 --> 00:14:53.343
there's somebody somewhere out there

00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:54.613
playing some music,

00:14:54.613 --> 00:14:56.393
and this is a small but I think important

00:14:56.393 --> 00:14:57.613
human connection to make

00:14:57.613 --> 00:15:00.611
that perhaps the technology affords.

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:03.435
As a final example,

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.790
and perhaps my favorite example,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.941
is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.427
and tsunami disaster in Japan,

00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:13.270
a woman reached out in one of our singing apps

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.157
to try to get people to join in to sing with her

00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:17.762
on a version of "Lean on Me."

00:15:17.762 --> 00:15:20.810
Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.511
any user to add their voice

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:25.309
to an existing performance by any other user

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:26.363
or group of users,

00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:28.388
so in some sense, she's created this kind of

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:31.772
global ad hoc corral of strangers,

00:15:31.772 --> 00:15:33.980
and within weeks, thousands of people

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.612
joined in on this,

00:15:35.612 --> 00:15:37.991
and you can kind of see people
coming from all around the world

00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:40.272
and all these lines converging on the origin

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.620
where the first rendition of the song was sung,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.254
and that's in Tokyo.

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:47.686
And this is what it sounds like 
when there's 1,000 people.

00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:49.663
This is 1,000 voices.

Is this computer music?

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.884
(Applause)

00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:44.696
Was that computer music?

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:46.743
Yeah, I guess so; it's something that you really

00:16:46.743 --> 00:16:49.028
couldn't have done without computers.

00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:53.264
But at the same time, it's also just human,

00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:56.353
and I think what I've essentially answered so far

00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:59.744
is maybe why I do the stuff that I do,

00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:02.136
and let's just finally return to the first question:

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:04.248
What is computer music?

00:17:04.248 --> 00:17:06.552
And I think that the catch here is that,

00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:07.808
at least to me, computer music

00:17:07.808 --> 00:17:09.656
isn't really about computers.

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.182
It is about people.

00:17:11.182 --> 00:17:12.816
It's about how we can use technology

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.862
to change the way we think

00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:16.306
and do and make music,

00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:19.992
and maybe even add to how we can

00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:22.502
connect with each other through music.

00:17:22.502 --> 00:17:24.655
And with that, I want to say,

00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:27.752
this is computer music, and thank you for listening.

00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:31.752
(Applause)
