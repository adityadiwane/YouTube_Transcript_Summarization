00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:17.153
The theme of my talk today is,

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.361
"Be an artist, right now."

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.418
Most people, when this subject is brought up,

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:26.044
get tense and resist it:

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:29.038
"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.414
I have to go to school, get a job,

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:33.701
send my kids to lessons ... "

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:39.236
You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:42.697
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:44.252
Don't they just pop into your head?

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.075
There are so many reasons why we can't be,

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.635
indeed, we're not sure why we should be.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:50.328
We don't know why we should be artists,

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:54.231
but we have many reasons why we can't be.

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:58.606
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:02.474
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:07.526
or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:11.869
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.487
Well you might have, but I don't think so.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:18.956
This is the theme of my talk today.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:20.758
We are all born artists.

00:01:20.758 --> 00:01:23.802
If you have kids, you know what I mean.

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:28.687
Almost everything kids do is art.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.265
They draw with crayons on the wall.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.417
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.275
but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:43.561
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.535
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:52.732
and because they practice such art all day long,

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:56.011
people honestly get a little tired around kids.

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.166
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.712
playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.391
And some kids, when they get a bit older,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.411
start to lie.

00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.502
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:13.847
They're shocked.

00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:17.415
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:20.621
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:22.192
But you shouldn't worry.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:28.412
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.

00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:30.600
They are talking about things they didn't see.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.391
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.

00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.458
Parents should celebrate.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:38.615
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:40.844
All right! It calls for celebration.

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:44.233
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:48.684
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:52.300
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.372
"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?

00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:57.076
Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.398
When you have a conversation like this,

00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:05.773
the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:07.937
Soon, a story develops.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:12.414
Of course this is an infantile story,

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:16.230
but thinking up one sentence after the next

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.298
is the same thing a professional writer like me does.

00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:22.677
In essence, they are not different.

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:25.363
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:27.969
"Flaubert did not write a novel.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.974
He merely connected one sentence after another.

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:35.701
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."

00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:38.484
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.943
then, without violating the scope of the first one,

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:43.648
writing the next sentence.

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:45.157
And you continue to make connections.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.223
Take a look at this sentence:

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:49.690
"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.136
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:55.304
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:57.752
and continuing in order to justify it,

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:02.181
Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:04.930
Kafka did not show his work to his father.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.254
He was not on good terms with his father.

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:11.050
On his own, he wrote these sentences.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.313
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.225
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:18.472
and justifying the next sentence,

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:21.733
which is not much different from what a kid does.

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:23.264
A kid who has just started to lie

00:04:23.264 --> 00:04:26.390
is taking the first step as a storyteller.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.951
Kids do art.

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:30.376
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.

00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:32.137
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:37.249
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.156
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:42.400
making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.347
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.

00:04:46.347 --> 00:04:47.760
But parents tell them,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.523
"It will all be washed away by the waves."

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:51.345
In other words, it's useless.

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:52.489
There's no need.

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.355
But kids don't mind.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.526
They have fun in the moment

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.692
and they keep playing in the sand.

00:04:57.692 --> 00:04:59.958
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.554
They aren't told by their boss

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:04.479
or anyone, they just do it.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.875
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:14.237
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:20.161
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:22.916
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:27.932
or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:31.283
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.

00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:33.606
They talk about these kinds of experiences.

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.871
You must have had such a moment.

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:37.804
In that moment, art makes you happy

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.481
because it's not work.

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:42.014
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.

00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:45.115
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:46.805
It's a bit mischievous, actually.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:51.777
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.262
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?

00:05:53.262 --> 00:05:54.923
Playing doesn't tire us.

00:05:54.923 --> 00:05:56.358
We can play all night long.

00:05:56.358 --> 00:05:58.791
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.075
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:06.757
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.

00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:09.491
They don't draw to sell the work to a client

00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:12.516
or play the piano to earn money for the family.

00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:15.292
Of course, there were kids who had to.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.594
You know this gentleman, right?

00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:20.680
He had to tour around Europe to support his family --

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.570
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.533
but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:29.398
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.

00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.788
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:36.306
and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,

00:06:36.306 --> 00:06:38.075
but they aren't fun anymore.

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:41.407
You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?

00:06:41.407 --> 00:06:46.999
If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.914
you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.

00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:54.781
Besides,

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.361
if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,

00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:01.029
you'll increasingly feel pressure --

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:07.084
people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.

00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:13.271
Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.178
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:19.766
and asked me, "What are you doing?"

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.580
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.483
"Why are you using only black?"

00:07:23.483 --> 00:07:25.863
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.

00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:28.932
And I explained,

00:07:28.932 --> 00:07:32.179
"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:33.177
Then my teacher said,

00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:38.499
"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:41.234
Or so I wished.

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:44.002
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)

00:07:44.002 --> 00:07:45.606
"You'll get it!" he said.

00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:48.288
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:50.723
but I was coloring everything in black,

00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:52.407
so he dragged me out of the group.

00:07:52.407 --> 00:07:54.427
There were a lot of girls there as well,

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:55.978
so I was utterly mortified.

00:07:55.978 --> 00:08:00.430
None of my explanations or excuses were heard,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.643
and I really got it big time.

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:08.161
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.474
"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,

00:08:10.474 --> 00:08:13.849
but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:17.301
But such a teacher is seldom found.

00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:20.264
Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries --

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:22.165
I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:27.563
Look what I found. (Laughter)

00:08:27.563 --> 00:08:31.888
Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished

00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:37.281
and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.

00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:40.287
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.203
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.

00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:46.148
No crows are brought up.

00:08:46.148 --> 00:08:49.481
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.

00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:52.582
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:57.951
is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --

00:08:57.951 --> 00:08:59.430
essentially the same as I did.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.178
Of course, my work was very amateur,

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:05.467
but let's turn to more famous examples.

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:08.068
This is Picasso's.

00:09:08.068 --> 00:09:13.869
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:18.513
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".

00:09:18.513 --> 00:09:20.107
That was Duchamp.

00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:24.557
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --

00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:28.684
that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:30.072
Picasso even made the statement,

00:09:30.072 --> 00:09:34.249
"I draw not what I see but what I think."

00:09:34.249 --> 00:09:36.766
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:40.837
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.

00:09:40.837 --> 00:09:44.639
Unfortunately, the little artists within us

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:50.126
are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.

00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:51.731
They get locked in.

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:52.814
That's our tragedy.

00:09:52.814 --> 00:09:58.074
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?

00:09:58.074 --> 00:09:59.457
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.

00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:02.554
We want to express, to reveal ourselves,

00:10:02.554 --> 00:10:07.792
but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:10.759
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:13.301
"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"

00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:15.621
miming the guitar riffs.

00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:17.863
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:20.342
Some people turn into rockers like this.

00:10:20.342 --> 00:10:22.415
Or some people dance in clubs.

00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:25.817
People who would have enjoyed telling stories

00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:28.827
end up trolling on the Internet all night long.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:32.222
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:36.175
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids

00:10:36.175 --> 00:10:39.160
playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.893
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."

00:10:40.893 --> 00:10:42.528
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:46.537
but the dad alone builds castles.

00:10:46.537 --> 00:10:51.015
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:54.807
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.

00:10:54.807 --> 00:11:00.101
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?

00:11:00.101 --> 00:11:03.929
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.869
but never got to.

00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:11.998
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.

00:11:11.998 --> 00:11:15.148
So we start to envy them.

00:11:15.148 --> 00:11:19.242
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.

00:11:19.242 --> 00:11:25.095
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."

00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:27.385
We easily say these sorts of things.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:30.328
We get jealous, not because we're evil,

00:11:30.328 --> 00:11:34.865
but because we have little artists pent up inside us.

00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:38.451
That's what I think.

00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.289
What should we do then?

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:41.066
Yes, that's right.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:44.260
Right now, we need to start our own art.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.269
Right this minute, we can turn off TV,

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:47.718
log off the Internet,

00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:50.418
get up and start to do something.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.153
Where I teach students in drama school,

00:11:52.153 --> 00:11:54.887
there's a course called Dramatics.

00:11:54.887 --> 00:11:59.077
In this course, all students must put on a play.

00:11:59.077 --> 00:12:03.189
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:05.209
They can write the play, for example,

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:07.933
and the writers may work on stage art.

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:10.229
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.

00:12:10.244 --> 00:12:13.992
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,

00:12:13.992 --> 00:12:18.555
but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.

00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:22.717
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.

00:12:22.717 --> 00:12:27.613
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:30.545
I have another experience:

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:34.179
In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:40.079
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:44.656
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.

00:12:44.656 --> 00:12:48.383
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.

00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:49.997
It can be a simple theme:

00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:52.511
Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.

00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:56.424
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!

00:12:56.424 --> 00:12:59.157
I walk around and encourage them,

00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:02.901
"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.

00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:06.109
They only get to think for the first five minutes.

00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:09.331
The reason I make them write like crazy is because

00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:12.089
when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:14.536
the artistic devil creeps in.

00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:18.568
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons

00:13:18.568 --> 00:13:21.498
why you can't write:

00:13:21.498 --> 00:13:24.333
"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:25.883
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"

00:13:25.883 --> 00:13:27.460
It will say a lot of things.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.964
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.

00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:34.036
The really good writing I've seen in my class

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:36.709
was not from the assignments with a long deadline,

00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:40.193
but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did

00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:43.595
in front of me with a pencil.

00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:45.434
The students go into a kind of trance.

00:13:45.434 --> 00:13:49.896
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:52.861
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.

00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.570
So I can say this:

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.585
It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,

00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:02.835
but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.

00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:04.544
Why we cannot be something is not important.

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.694
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.

00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:11.364
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,

00:14:11.364 --> 00:14:13.698
enemies appear on the outside.

00:14:13.698 --> 00:14:16.554
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:19.655
Sometimes they look like our spouses,

00:14:19.655 --> 00:14:21.423
but they are not your parents or spouses.

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:24.317
They are devils. Devils.

00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:26.261
They came to Earth briefly transformed

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:30.207
to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.

00:14:30.207 --> 00:14:32.129
And they have a magic question.

00:14:32.129 --> 00:14:38.287
When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or

00:14:38.287 --> 00:14:42.764
"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:46.426
The magic question is, "What for?"

00:14:46.426 --> 00:14:50.138
But art is not for anything.

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:52.392
Art is the ultimate goal.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:56.532
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.

00:14:56.532 --> 00:15:02.038
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.

00:15:02.038 --> 00:15:06.363
So in response to such a pragmatic question,

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.797
we need to be bold.

00:15:08.797 --> 00:15:13.241
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"

00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:17.266
is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:22.366
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,

00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:26.147
at least one of which is an artist.

00:15:26.147 --> 00:15:29.316
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,

00:15:29.316 --> 00:15:33.473
and in front of me I saw something related to a play.

00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:34.610
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.655
He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:42.078
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"

00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:44.104
He proudly said he played King Lear.

00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:45.549
King Lear.

00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:47.175
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear.

00:15:47.175 --> 00:15:50.566
That's the world I dream of.

00:15:50.566 --> 00:15:54.501
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.

00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:57.020
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:02.596
secretly or publicly performing their own arts.

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:07.467
In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:13.223
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:16.304
and a reporter asked her a typical question:

00:16:16.304 --> 00:16:18.911
"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:21.491
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"

00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:26.486
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.677
In 1990, she was asked this question.

00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:31.361
And here's what she answered:

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:35.278
"Just do it."

00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:36.796
Wow. I was touched.

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:40.888
Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.

00:16:40.888 --> 00:16:44.119
So what should we do now?

00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:47.845
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?

00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:48.837
Just do it!

00:16:48.837 --> 00:16:50.451
Thank you.

00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:52.255
(Applause)
