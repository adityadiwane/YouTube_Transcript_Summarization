00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So, what I'm going to do is

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
just give you the latest episode of India's --

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
which is cricket.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.260
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
It's got love, joy, happiness,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
sadness, tears, laughter,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
lots of deceit, intrigue.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
when the audience interest changes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
And that's exactly what cricket has done.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
It's jumped 20 years

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
into 20-over game.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
And that's what I'm going to talk about,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
how a small change

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
leads to a very big revolution.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
But it wasn't always like that.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Cricket wasn't always this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
speed-driven generations game.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
There was a time when you played cricket,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
you played timeless test matches,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
when you played on till the game got over.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
And there was this game in March 1939

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
that started on the third of March

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and ended on the 14th of March.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And it only ended because the English cricketers

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
had to go from Durban to Cape Town,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
which is a two-hour train journey,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
to catch the ship that left on the 17th,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
So, the match was ended in between.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
Another half an hour and we would have won."

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
(Laughter)

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Another half an hour after 12 days.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
so they all sat around making friends with each other.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.260
because we had about the same pace of life.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
(Laughter)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.260
You fought by day, then it was sunset,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
so everyone went back home.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
And then you worked out your strategy,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Princes patronize the game,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
not because they love the game,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
to the British rulers.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
which was, all you needed was a plank of wood

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and a rubber ball, and any number of people

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
could play it anywhere.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Take a look:

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
You could play it in the dump

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
with some rocks over there,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
you could play it in a little alley --

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.260
(Laughter)

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
(Laughter)

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
As you can see, you can play anywhere.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
But slowly the game moved on,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
you know, finally.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and we started playing 50-over cricket.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And then an enormous accident took place.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
In Indian sport we don't make things happen,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And we won this World Cup in 1983.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and we played it virtually every day.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
But there was another big date.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
1983 was when we won the World Cup.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
1991,'92, we found a finance minister

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and a prime minister

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
willing to let the world look at India,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
rather than be this great country of intrigue

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
and mystery in this closed country.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And so we allowed multinationals into India.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
and we got all the multinationals coming in,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
with multinational budgets,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
who looked at per-capita income

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and got very excited about the possibilities in India,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
The scripted one is what you see in the movies,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.260
the real one was cricket.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
all over the world.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
And so cricket started becoming big;

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
cricket started bringing riches in.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Television started covering cricket. For a long time

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
television said, "We won't cover cricket

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
unless you pay us to cover it."

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
Then they said, "OK,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
So, it's a bit of a curve, that.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
England invented 20 overs cricket,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
Thank God for them.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.260
(Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
And then something very dramatic happened.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
We got to the final, and then this moment,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
that will remain enshrined forever,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
for everybody, take a look.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
(Crowd cheering)

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
What a match for a Twenty20 final.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
India, the world champions.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.260
(Cheering)

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
India, T20 champions.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260
got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
A massive, massive success:

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.260
India, the world TT champions.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
thought the bowler was bowling fast.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.260
(Laughter)

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
that we could be good at this game.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
And what it also did was

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260
It was at a time when investment was coming in,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
India was feeling a little more confident about itself.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.260
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
in what we can do.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And thankfully for all of us,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
the English are very good at inventing things,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
and then the gracious people that they are,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
they let the world become very good at it.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
(Laughter)

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.260
And so England invented T20 cricket,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
and allowed India to hijack it.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
we just took it straight away, as is.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
(Laughter)

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
And so, we launched our own T20 league.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
Six weeks, city versus city.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
the only two areas in which India was very proud about

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
their country, representing itself on the field.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
The other was Indian cricket.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
But the people getting into these city leagues

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
were people who were taking their cues from the West.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
America is a home of leagues. And they said,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
But was India ready for it?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
simple family game.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
All of a sudden, you had that happening.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
(Music)

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
An opening ceremony to match every other.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
than New Zealand's population twice over.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
So, it was a different India.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.260
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.260
that was very happy to be modern,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
but didn't want to say that to people.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
(Music)

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
(Laughter)

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
They were not bureaucrats who were forced

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
into sport because they didn't actually love it;

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
these were people who ran serious companies.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
And so they started promoting cricket big time,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.260
started promoting clubs big time.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
before a ball was bowled,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
But what they were very good at doing

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.260
was making it very localized.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
So, just to give you an example of how they did it --

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
not Manchester United style promotion,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
(Music)

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
(Laughter)

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.260
But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.260
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.260
your own city, and you were very proud

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260
of the system that produced those cricketers.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
they needn't go to Kalbadevi

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
they could go to Trinidad.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
where you can source from anywhere

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
as long as you get the best product at the best price.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.260
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
that you can source the best product for the best price

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
anywhere in the world.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
overnight. And when he had to go back to represent

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.260
the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.260
it's about when do you have to reach there?"

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.260
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.260
So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.260
(Laughter)

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Never would India have thought on this scale before.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
to play a game."

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
And I just thought to myself,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
But what this also did was it started

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
There is cricket and the movies.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And they came together because people in the movies

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
now started owning clubs.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.260
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And something very interesting happened.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.260
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
you got a hug from Preity Zinta.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
everyone's watching Preity Zinta.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.260
(Music)

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
but we'd never seen anything like this:

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.260
But take a look at this.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.260
(Music)

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
because they'd won in Kolkata.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
Can you imagine?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
(Applause)

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.260
(Laughter)

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
But I thought I'd take this opportunity --

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
there's a few people from Pakistan in here.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
I'm so happy that you're here

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
We can play cricket together, we can be friends.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.260
(Applause)

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
There was criticism too because they said,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
"Players are being bought and sold?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
Are they grain?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
Are they cattle?"

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Because we had this auction, you see.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
How do you fix a price for a player?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And so the auction that followed

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
literally had people saying,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260
"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
There it is.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
(Music)

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.260
Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
so 250 rupees for a test match,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.260
but if you finish in four days you only got 200.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
The best Indian players who played every test match --

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.260
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.260
Could you have imagined that day would come?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
That's not bad, is it?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
itself against the best in the world,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.260
and it became a huge brand.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
IPL became the biggest brand in India

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.260
and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.260
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.260
But we did it. You know why?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.260
Because no country works as slowly as we do

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
till three weeks before an event,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:23.260
(Applause)

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
suddenly became our biggest asset

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260
because there were more people watching --

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.260
the huge consuming class --

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
everybody came to watch the cricket.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
which is a pity, but in India every other sport

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
pushes cricket to become big,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
Now, this last minute before I go --

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
there's a couple of side effects of all this.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
For a long time, India was this country of poverty,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
dust, beggars,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
snake charmers, filth,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.260
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Cricketers all over the world said,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.260
"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
And that felt good, you know?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.260
Right so, finally,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.260
an English game that India usurped a little bit,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
If you want to take the game around the world,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
it's got to be the shortest form of the game.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.260
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.260
or you can't take it all over the world.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
So that's what T20 is doing.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.260
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
(Applause)
