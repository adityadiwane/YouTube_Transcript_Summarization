00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:18.775
This is how war starts.

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:22.041
One day you're living your ordinary life,

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.557
you're planning to go to a party,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.941
you're taking your children to school,

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.654
you're making a dentist appointment.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:33.280
The next thing, the telephones go out,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.217
the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.533
there's roadblocks.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:44.010
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.215
It stops.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:48.773
I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:51.751
a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.128
because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.

00:00:56.128 --> 00:01:00.222
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992,

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:03.370
in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.894
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:08.728
Great person.

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:12.035
And suddenly she sees a tank

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:15.241
ambling down the main road of Sarajevo

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.793
knocking everything out of its path.

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:22.824
She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:25.569
And she runs as any of us would have done

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.586
and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:32.185
in her high heels and her miniskirt.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:36.404
And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:39.100
but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.460
and people all over the place and chaos

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.087
and she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:48.422
going down the rabbit hole,

00:01:48.422 --> 00:01:51.490
down, down, down into chaos,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.891
and my life will never be the same again."

00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.678
A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people

00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:05.628
pushing with her infant son in her arms

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:08.164
to give him to a stranger on a bus,

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:11.188
which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo

00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:14.353
to take children out so they could be safe.

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:18.463
And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:21.889
crowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.942
and passing her son to someone through a window.

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:30.810
And she didn't see him for years.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.529
The siege went on for three and a half years,

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.818
and it was a siege without water,

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:42.107
without power, without electricity, without heat, without food,

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:47.462
in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.

00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:51.264
I had the honor of being one of those reporters

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.683
that lived through that siege,

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:56.721
and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.911
because it's taught me everything,

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:03.040
not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.395
I learned about compassion.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:09.206
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:13.577
I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.

00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:16.488
Most of all, I learned about love.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:21.767
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.903
I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.547
share food, raise their children,

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:30.799
drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.656
even though you yourself were endangering your life,

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.907
helping people get into taxis who were injured

00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:39.528
to try to take them to hospitals.

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:42.747
I learned so much about myself.

00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:45.772
Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:50.970
"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.506
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:57.135
so many that I lost count,

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:00.218
but there was nothing like Sarajevo.

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:04.173
Last April, I went back to a very strange --

00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:07.947
what I called a deranged high school reunion.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:12.290
What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.762
the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:19.202
and I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:20.605
and this was not a party.

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:24.593
It was a very somber gathering of the reporters

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:27.984
that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:32.453
and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.

00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:34.872
And the thing that struck me the most,

00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:36.613
that broke my heart,

00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:38.783
was walking down the main street of Sarajevo,

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:42.858
where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,

00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:49.555
and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.181
empty,

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:53.450
and every single one of them symbolized

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.167
a person who had died during the siege,

00:04:57.167 --> 00:05:01.454
just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:04.041
and it stretched from one end of the city

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.315
to a large part of it,

00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:09.818
and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs

00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:12.674
for the children.

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:15.801
I now cover Syria,

00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:18.991
and I started reporting it because I believed that

00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:21.247
it needs to be done.

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:24.252
I believe a story there has to be told.

00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:28.222
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.

00:05:28.222 --> 00:05:30.451
And when I first arrived in Damascus,

00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.853
I saw this strange moment where people

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:36.413
didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:38.348
and it was exactly the same in Bosnia

00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:41.162
and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.

00:05:41.162 --> 00:05:43.705
People don't want to believe it's coming,

00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:47.172
so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.

00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:48.842
They don't get their money out.

00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:52.737
They stay because you want to stay in your home.

00:05:52.737 --> 00:05:56.776
And then war and chaos descend.

00:05:56.776 --> 00:06:00.579
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:06.733
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:11.582
Between April and August, 1994,

00:06:11.582 --> 00:06:15.783
one million people were slaughtered.

00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:21.010
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.082
with the sheer number,

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.713
I want you just for a second to think of a million people.

00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:29.250
And to give you some example, I remember

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.331
standing and looking down a road as far as I could see,

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:40.420
at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.144
of the dead.

00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:45.479
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.448
And there were mothers holding their children

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:50.789
who had been caught in their last death throes.

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.119
So we learn a lot from war,

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.471
and I mention Rwanda

00:06:56.471 --> 00:07:00.589
because it is one place, like South Africa,

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:04.571
where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.

00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:08.039
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.491
which is fantastic,

00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:14.517
and there's also within the national constitution now,

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.690
you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.559
You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:26.105
which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:29.212
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,

00:07:29.212 --> 00:07:30.695
or I find it beautiful.

00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:35.612
There was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:38.326
and a group of women who were adopting them,

00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:42.260
and they lined up and one was just given to the next.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.426
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:48.341
you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,

00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:50.187
you might have killed my father.

00:07:50.187 --> 00:07:55.493
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,

00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:59.077
and I find this remarkable.

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.919
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war,

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.131
and why I continue to do it,

00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:05.600
this is why.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.991
When I go back to Syria, next week in fact,

00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:12.952
what I see is incredibly heroic people,

00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:15.225
some of them fighting for democracy,

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:19.242
for things we take for granted every single day.

00:08:19.242 --> 00:08:22.480
And that's pretty much why I do it.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.948
In 2004, I had a little baby boy,

00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:30.143
and I call him my miracle child,

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:33.189
because after seeing so much death

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:37.366
and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:41.225
this ray of hope was born.

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:45.422
And I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light,"

00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:50.345
because he does bring light to my life.

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:53.796
But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,

00:08:53.796 --> 00:08:58.468
my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad

00:08:58.468 --> 00:09:01.800
where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.679
and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:07.773
and I remember getting on the plane in tears,

00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:10.759
crying to be separated from my son,

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.992
and while I was there,

00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:15.727
a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine

00:09:15.727 --> 00:09:18.201
said to me, "What are you doing here?

00:09:18.201 --> 00:09:20.042
Why aren't you home with Luca?"

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:23.827
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:28.214
which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:31.454
"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:32.319
I have to report it."

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:35.883
And he said, "Go home,

00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:39.169
because if you miss his first tooth,

00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:42.167
if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:46.030
But there will always be another war."

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.371
And there, sadly, will always be wars.

00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:54.225
And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,

00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:55.991
as a reporter, as a writer,

00:09:55.991 --> 00:10:00.829
what I do can stop them. I can't.

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.376
I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.

00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:06.353
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.

00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:10.349
I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.

00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:12.632
I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:15.458
and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt

00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:18.729
to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.

00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:22.564
All I am is a witness.

00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:27.618
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.

00:10:27.618 --> 00:10:30.851
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light

00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:33.613
in the darkest corners of the world.

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:36.260
And that's what I try to do.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.296
I'm not always successful,

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:41.837
and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,

00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:44.043
because you feel like you're writing into a void,

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.372
or you feel like no one cares.

00:10:46.372 --> 00:10:48.621
Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?

00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.634
Who cares about the Congo,

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:52.908
the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,

00:10:52.908 --> 00:10:55.023
all of these strings of places that

00:10:55.023 --> 00:10:58.996
I will remember for the rest of my life?

00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:02.249
But my métier is to bear witness

00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:05.431
and that is the crux, the heart of the matter,

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.972
for us reporters who do this.

00:11:07.972 --> 00:11:11.563
And all I can really do is hope,

00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:14.171
not to policymakers or politicians,

00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:16.568
because as much as I'd like to have faith

00:11:16.568 --> 00:11:19.033
that they read my words and do something,

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:22.193
I don't delude myself.

00:11:22.193 --> 00:11:26.410
But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.963
or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,

00:11:29.963 --> 00:11:32.645
if you can remember the story of Sarajevo,

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:36.136
or the story of Rwanda,

00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:38.709
then I've done my job.

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:40.747
Thank you very much.

00:11:40.747 --> 00:11:47.977
(Applause)
