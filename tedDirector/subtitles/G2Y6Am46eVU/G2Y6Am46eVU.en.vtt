00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.330
My story actually began when I was four years old

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
and my family moved to a new neighborhood

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
And this was the 1960s

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
when actually all the streets in this neighborhood

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
were named after Confederate war generals.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
And when I was five,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
that made the rider look like an orangutan.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
That's why they were called ape hangers.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
which I'm sure my mom didn't know.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330
hidden away a few streets away.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
And I came back,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
so I decided to turn around in this big street

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
that intersected our neighborhood,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
My mangled body flew in one direction,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
my mangled bike flew in the other.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330
and one of my neighbors came running over.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
(Laughter)

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I broke my left femur that day --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
it's the largest bone in your body --

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
and spent the next two months in a body cast

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330
that went from my chin to the tip of my toe

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.330
to my right knee,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330
and a steel bar went from my right knee

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
to my left ankle.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
And for the next 38 years,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
that accident was the only medically interesting thing

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
that ever happened to me.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
In fact, I made a living by walking.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
wrote a series of books about my travels,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
including "Walking the Bible."

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
I hosted a television show by that name

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
on PBS.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
I was, for all the world, the "walking guy."

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Until, in May 2008,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
a routine visit to my doctor

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
and a routine blood test

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
that something might be wrong with my bones.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
which showed that there was some growth in my left leg.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
"The tumor in your leg

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
is not consistent with a benign tumor."

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
I stopped walking,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.330
into a much more horrifying negative.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330
I have cancer.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.330
in the same place in my body

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
as the accident 38 years earlier --

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
it seemed like too much of a coincidence.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
So that afternoon, I went back to my house,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330
came running to meet me.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.330
They'd just turned three,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
and they were into all things pink and purple.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.330
In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
although I must say, our favorite nickname

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
occurred on their birthday, April 15th.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
on April 15, 2005,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330
our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
Early filer and late filer."

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.330
(Laughter)

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.330
The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke."

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
And he was like, "You're the writer, kid."

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
Anyway -- so they had just turned three,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
laughing with all the glee in the world.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
I crumbled.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
the art projects I might not mess up,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
the boyfriends I might not scowl at,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.330
the aisles I might not walk down.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330
Would they wonder who I was, I thought.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
Would they yearn for my approval,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
my love, my voice?

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
A few days later, I woke with an idea

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
of how I might give them that voice.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.330
I would reach out to six men

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330
from all parts of my life

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
and ask them to be present

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.330
in the passages of my daughters' lives.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,"

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
I wrote these men.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330
"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330
but they may not have me.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
They may not have their dad.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
Will you help be their dad?"

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
And I said to myself

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
Now as soon as I had this idea,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
She's a very upbeat,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
naturally excited person.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
There's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
We should focus on the positive.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330
She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
She's got big hair --

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
because if I say she has big hair,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
people will think she's from Texas.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
but not to have hair from Texas.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.330
she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
there were three questions

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
on the marriage certificate license,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
the third of which was, "Are you related?"

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
(Laughter)

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330
I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
In Arkansas they don't even ask."

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
You don't need the 30-day waiting period.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330
but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
And she loved the idea,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
but she quickly started rejecting my nominees.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice."

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
So it turned out that starting a council of dads

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
was a very efficient way to find out

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
what my wife really thought of my friends.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
(Laughter)

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.330
So we decided that we needed a set of rules,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.330
and we came up with a number.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
And the first one was no family, only friends.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
We thought our family would already be there.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
Second, men only.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.330
And then third, sort of a dad for every side.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
We kind of went through my personality

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.330
and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.330
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330
And rather than send it,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
I decided to read it to them in person.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.330
Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
I sort of friend-married each of these guys.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
And I snuck out behind,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.330
And Jeff came up beside me and said,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.330
"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.330
I was like, "Cow tipping?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
So if you approach them from behind, down wind,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
you can push them over and they go thud in the mud."

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
we were tiptoeing through the dung

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.330
and approaching some poor, dozing cow.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
So a few weeks after my diagnosis,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.330
we went up to Vermont,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
"Will you help be their dad?"

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.330
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes."

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.330
I was like, "Yes?"

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
And frankly, although I keep getting asked this,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
under the circumstances.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
And that was, "What's the one piece of advice

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
you would give to my girls?"

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.330
And Jeff's advice was,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.330
"Be a traveller, not a tourist.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.330
Get off the bus. Seek out what's different.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.330
Approach the cow."

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
"So it's 10 years from now," I said,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.330
"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.330
What would you tell them?"

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
He said, "I would approach this journey

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
as a young child might approach a mud puddle.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.330
or you can jump in and thrash around

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.330
and see what it feels like, what it smells like."

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
that I first saw back in Holland --

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
even though we never did tip the cow,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.330
even though no one tips the cow,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
even though cows don't sleep standing up.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
He said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.330
covered in mud."

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.330
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
in my left femur.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
Eighty-five percent are under 21.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
Only a hundred adults a year

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
get one of these diseases.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.330
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
and there was a 15 percent survival rate.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.330
And then in the 1980's, they determined

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.330
and within weeks I had started that regimen.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
And since we are in a medical room,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
I went through four and a half months of chemo.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.330
and very high-dose Methotrexate.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.330
And then I had a 15-hour surgery

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.330
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.330
took out my left femur

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
and replaced it with titanium.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.330
And if you did see the Sanjay special,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.330
you saw these enormous screws

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.330
that they screwed into my pelvis.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
Then he took my fibula from my calf,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.330
cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
where it now lives.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.330
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
and re-vascularized it in my thigh

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
and then connected it

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
to the good parts of my knee and my hip.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
This is a surgery so rare

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
only two human beings have survived it before me.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And my reward for surviving it

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.330
was to go back for four more months of chemo.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
It was, as we said in my house,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
a lost year.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.330
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.330
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
sitting on my desk.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.330
And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.330
I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
of William Sloane Coffin --

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.330
it made me think of it.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.330
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330
that my daughters, at that time three and a half,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
were missing me and feeling my absence.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
And I hung up the phone,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.330
and I put my face in my hands,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.330
and I screamed this silent scream.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
And what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
made me think of this today.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
Because the thought that came to my mind

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
was that the feeling that I had

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
was like a primal scream.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And what was so striking --

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
is the experience.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.330
As I became less and less human --

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.330
and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.330
Of course, I had no hair and no immune system.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.330
They were actually putting blood inside my body.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
At that moment I was less and less human,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
I was also, at the same time,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
maybe the most human I've ever been.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
And what was so striking about that time

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.330
was, instead of repulsing people,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.330
I was actually proving to be a magnet for people.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.330
People were incredibly drawn.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.330
Instead, it was everybody running the other way.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.330
And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.330
And when people came to me,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.330
rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.330
I was like a living ghost --

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.330
they were incredibly moved

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
to talk about what was going on in their own lives.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.330
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.330
to enter the most vital arenas of human life,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
the most sensitive and the most frightening,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.330
the ones that we never want to go to,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.330
but when we do go there,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
we feel incredibly transformed when we do.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.330
and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.330
One day, my daughter Tybee,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.330
Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
because that's where love comes from."

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
(Laughter)

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
And one night my daughter Eden came to me.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
And as I lifted my leg out of bed,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.330
she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
it would be walking down a darkened hallway

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
with five spongy fingers

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
grasping the handle underneath my hand.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.330
I didn't need the crutch anymore,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.330
I was walking on air.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.330
And one of the profound things that happened

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
was this act of actually connecting to all these people.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.330
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.330
one word that I've only heard once actually

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.330
was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.330
the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.330
is the word "friend."

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
And yet from everything we've been talking about --

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.330
compliance, or addiction, or weight loss --

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
we now know that community is important,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
And there was something incredibly profound

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
about sitting down with my closest friends

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.330
and telling them what they meant to me.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.330
And one of the things that I learned is that over time,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
particularly men, who used to be non-communicative,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.330
are becoming more and more communicative.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.330
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
is this Council of Dads

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
that Linda said, what we were talking about,

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.330
it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
And no one captures this modern manhood to me

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
more than David Black.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
Now David is my literary agent.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.330
standing fully upright in cowboy boots.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
I can say this I guess because you've done it here --

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker."

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.330
and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.330
although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
he leaves work early to coach Little League.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.330
Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.330
I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk."

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
(Laughter)

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
But he's a literary agent,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
And this is what we wanted him to capture --

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
And he said, "A belief in themselves."

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
I was at a wall."

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
Don't see the wall.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
You may encounter one from time to time,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.330
but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
But whatever you do, don't succumb to it.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
Don't give in to the wall.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.330
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.330
and during the year and a half I was on crutches,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.330
it became a sort of symbol to me.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.330
So one day near the end of my journey,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.330
We set out on crutches.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330
I was on crutches, my wife was next to me,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.330
And because walking was one of the first things I lost,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.330
I spent most of that year

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.330
thinking about this most elemental of human acts.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.330
Walking upright, we are told,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.330
is the threshold of what made us human.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.330
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.330
the act is essentially unchanged.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.330
As my physical therapist likes to say,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.330
"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen."

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.330
You nearly fall with one leg,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.330
then you catch yourself with the other.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.330
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
as I did for a year and a half --

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
is that you walk slower.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
You hurry,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.330
you get where you're going, but you get there alone.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
You go slow, you get where you're going,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
but you get there with this community

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
you built along the way.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
At the risk of admission, I was never nicer

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
than the year I was on crutches.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.330
200 years ago,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.330
a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.330
And it was the custom of those flaneurs

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.330
to show they were men of leisure

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.330
by taking turtles for walks

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
and letting the reptile set the pace.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
And I just love this ode to slow moving.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.330
And it's become my own motto for my girls.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.330
Take a walk with a turtle.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.330
Behold the world in pause.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.330
And this idea of pausing

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.330
may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.330
There's a quote from Moses

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.330
on the side of the Liberty Bell,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.330
and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.330
that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.330
And every seven sets of seven years,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.330
the land gets an extra year of rest

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.330
during which time all families are reunited

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.330
and people surrounded with the ones they love.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.330
That 50th year is called the jubilee year,

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.330
and it's the origin of that term.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.330
And though I'm shy of 50,

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.330
it captures my own experience.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.330
My lost year was my jubilee year.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.330
By laying fallow,

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
I planted the seeds for a healthier future

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.330
and was reunited with the ones I love.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.330
Come the one year anniversary of my journey,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.330
and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.330
He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.330
which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
And I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.330
and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.330
what would you tell them?"

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.330
He said, "I would tell them what I know,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.330
and that is everybody dies,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.330
but not everybody lives.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.330
I want you to live."

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.330
I wrote a letter to my girls

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.330
that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.330
and I listed these lessons,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.330
a few of which you've heard here today:

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.330
Approach the cow, pack your flipflops,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.330
don't see the wall,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.330
live the questions,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.330
harvest miracles.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330
I realized, we may have done it for our girls,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
but it really changed us.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.330
And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.330
is that my wife and I did this

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.330
in an attempt to help our daughters,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
but it really changed us.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.330
So I stand here today

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.330
as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.330
And last week I had my 18-month scans.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.330
And as you all know,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330
anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.330
In my case it's quarterly.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.330
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.330
can never find a solution for scan-xiety.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.330
As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.330
depending on what happened here.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.330
I got good news that day,

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.330
and I stand here today cancer-free,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.330
walking without aid

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.330
and hobbling forward.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.330
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.330
but I just want to briefly mention in passing

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.330
that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.330
is, at a similar meeting,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.330
back in the spring,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.330
Anne Wojcicki heard about our story

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.330
and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.330
put the full resources of 23andMe,

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.330
and we announced an initiative in July

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.330
to get to decode the genome

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
of anybody, a living person

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.330
with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330
And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.330
we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.330
And the epidemiologists here will tell you,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.330
that's half the number of people who get the disease

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.330
in one year in the United States.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.330
So if you go to 23andMe,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.330
or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.330
And we encourage anybody to join this effort.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.330
But I'll just close what I've been talking about

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.330
by leaving you with this message:

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.330
May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.330
or to that college roommate,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.330
or to some person you may have turned away from.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.330
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.330
or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.330
that stands between you and one of your dreams.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.330
And every now and then,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
find a friend, find a turtle,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.330
and take a long, slow walk.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.330
Thank you very much.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:27.330
(Applause)
