00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:18.756
Well, I was introduced as

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:20.788
the former Governor of Michigan,

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:23.804
but actually I'm a scientist.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.796
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:30.592
but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:33.748
that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:36.590
I was experimenting with policy

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.284
about what would achieve the greatest good

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:41.393
for the greatest number.

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:45.671
But there were three problems, three enigmas

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.205
that I could not solve,

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:51.683
and I want to share with you those problems,

00:00:51.683 --> 00:00:53.689
but most importantly,

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.445
I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:59.314
The first problem

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.305
that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.624
how do you create good jobs in America

00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:06.372
in a global economy?

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:09.864
So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.

00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:14.374
I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.906
I got a call from one of my staff members, who said,

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:19.274
"Gov, we have a big problem.

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:22.894
We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:25.156
population 8,000,

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:27.951
and they are about to lose their major employer,

00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:32.770
which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.449
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:40.379
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:43.160
So it is a one-company town.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.088
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:50.976
So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.264
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:55.232
with my whole cabinet and we will just

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:58.137
make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."

00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:00.568
So I brought my whole cabinet,

00:02:00.568 --> 00:02:04.280
and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville --

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.510
the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college --

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.105
and we basically emptied our pockets

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:14.398
and put all of our chips on the table,

00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:18.526
incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:20.177
and as we made our pile of chips,

00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:25.284
we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.

00:02:25.284 --> 00:02:29.392
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:33.608
or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,

00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:36.401
we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,

00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:40.240
said they would offer unprecedented concessions,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.293
sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.171
So the management of Electrolux took our pile,

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:49.984
our list of incentives, and they went outside the room

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:52.504
for 17 minutes,

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.735
and they came back in and they said,

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:57.676
"Wow, this is the most generous

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:02.165
any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.560
But there's nothing you can do

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.849
to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.107
in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:16.112
And they did. And when they did, it was like

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.368
a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.

00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:21.683
In fact, they did implode the factory.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:25.661
That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.685
And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:32.325
the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:37.990
had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.973
It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,

00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:45.462
and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor

00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:49.359
that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.882
and I wanted to grieve with them,

00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:55.202
and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.945
It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:03.105
on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:06.842
or a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:10.069
And this guy comes up to me,

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.809
and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.427
and he had his two daughters with him,

00:04:16.427 --> 00:04:20.034
and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:23.082
He said, "I'm 48 years old,

00:04:23.082 --> 00:04:27.640
and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.296
I went from high school to factory.

00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:32.904
My father worked at this factory," he said.

00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:35.753
"My grandfather worked at this factory.

00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:40.776
All I know is how to make refrigerators."

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:42.129
And he looked at his daughters,

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.617
and he puts his hand on his chest,

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.167
and he says, "So, Gov, tell me,

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:52.495
who is ever going to hire me?

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:55.928
Who is ever going to hire me?"

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.450
And that was asked not just by that guy

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.128
but by everyone in the pavilion,

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:07.968
and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:12.280
that closed in the first decade of this century.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.174
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:17.607
in America in a global economy?

00:05:17.607 --> 00:05:19.907
Number two, very quickly:

00:05:19.907 --> 00:05:22.639
How do you solve global climate change

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.976
when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:31.904
and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?

00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:35.066
In fact, there was a poll that was done recently

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:39.343
and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings

00:05:39.343 --> 00:05:41.773
to a number of other unpleasant things,

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:45.293
and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:48.175
is worse than cockroaches,

00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:55.167
lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:59.446
But wait, the good news is it's at least better

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:04.302
than meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:08.127
We got a problem, folks.

00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:09.765
So it got me thinking, what is it?

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:13.527
What in the laboratory that I see out there,

00:06:13.527 --> 00:06:15.677
the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:18.376
What policy prescriptions have happened

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:20.168
that actually cause changes to occur

00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:23.735
and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:25.013
So if I asked you, for example,

00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:27.493
what was the Obama Administration policy

00:06:27.493 --> 00:06:30.607
that caused massive changes across the country,

00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:31.895
what would you say?

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:35.690
You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.231
As we know, only half the states have opted in.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.740
We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.091
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur

00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:48.511
was Race to the Top for education.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:51.753
Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:55.199
and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.375
Forty-eight governors competed,

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.674
convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially

00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:03.960
raise standards for high schoolers

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.271
so that they all take a college prep curriculum.

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:11.657
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.

00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:14.260
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.306
and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?

00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:20.657
Because after all, if you look at the context,

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:24.635
1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:26.577
from the private sector globally,

00:07:26.577 --> 00:07:28.949
and every dollar represents a job,

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.544
and where are those jobs going?

00:07:30.544 --> 00:07:32.968
Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.

00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:34.990
In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.698
and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,

00:07:37.698 --> 00:07:40.701
and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations

00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:43.064
and standing next to one of the Chinese officials,

00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:44.726
and we were watching, and he says,

00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:49.360
"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.928
And I said, "Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?"

00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:56.942
And this is what he did, he goes, he says,

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:59.679
"Take your time."

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.317
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.250
So what if we decided to create

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.949
a challenge to the governors of the country,

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.755
and the price to entry into this competition

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:16.403
used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:19.093
for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,

00:08:19.093 --> 00:08:21.476
which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than

00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:23.965
one tenth of one percent of federal spending.

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:25.989
It's a rounding error on the federal side.

00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:29.907
But price to entry into that competition would be,

00:08:29.907 --> 00:08:33.212
you could just, say, use the President's goal.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:36.285
He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard

00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.560
of 80 percent by 2030,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.539
in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.189
of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.890
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.881
And imagine what might happen,

00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:50.869
because every region has something to offer.

00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.851
You might take states like Iowa and Ohio --

00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:55.868
two very important political states, by the way --

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.756
those two governors, and they would say,

00:08:57.756 --> 00:09:00.471
we're going to lead the nation in producing

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:03.073
the wind turbines and the wind energy.

00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:06.244
You might say the solar states, the sun belt,

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:09.944
we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,

00:09:09.944 --> 00:09:12.114
and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:14.291
an industry cluster in California

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:16.130
to be able to produce the solar panels

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.779
so that we're not buying them from China

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:19.642
but we're buying them from the U.S."

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:23.072
In fact, every region of the country could do this.

00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:27.178
You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.

00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:31.182
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states

00:09:31.182 --> 00:09:33.357
in the West, they could do geothermal,

00:09:33.357 --> 00:09:35.669
or you could look at Texas and say,

00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:39.037
we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:43.129
In the middle eastern states which have access to forests

00:09:43.144 --> 00:09:45.468
and to agricultural waste, they might say,

00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:48.069
we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:50.585
In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:53.449
in energy efficiency solutions.

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:56.418
Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation

00:09:56.418 --> 00:09:58.237
in offshore wind.

00:09:58.237 --> 00:10:00.820
You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.714
in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.

00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:08.121
Every region has something to offer,

00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:10.443
and if you created a competition,

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:14.561
it respects the states and it respects federalism.

00:10:14.561 --> 00:10:18.115
It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,

00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:20.785
who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:23.186
you might even get them to opt in. Why?

00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:25.737
Because Republican and Democratic governors

00:10:25.737 --> 00:10:27.391
love to cut ribbons.

00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:31.705
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.

00:10:31.705 --> 00:10:34.325
And it fosters innovation at the state level

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:36.786
in these laboratories of democracy.

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:41.092
Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately

00:10:41.092 --> 00:10:43.849
might say, "Okay, great idea, but really?

00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:46.481
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?

00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:48.754
They can't agree to anything."

00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:52.049
So you could wait and go through Congress,

00:10:52.049 --> 00:10:54.625
although you should be very impatient.

00:10:54.625 --> 00:11:02.529
Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.087
Go around Congress.

00:11:04.087 --> 00:11:10.715
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?

00:11:10.715 --> 00:11:15.675
What if several of the high-net worth companies

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:20.065
and individuals who are here at TED decided

00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:23.593
that they would create, band together, just a couple of them,

00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:27.153
and create a national competition to the governors

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.409
to have a race to the top

00:11:29.409 --> 00:11:32.078
and see how the governors respond?

00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:36.966
What if it all started here at TED?

00:11:36.966 --> 00:11:39.625
What if you were here

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:44.973
when we figured out how to crack the code

00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:50.419
to create good paying jobs in America -- (Applause) --

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.140
and get national energy policy

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:00.118
and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:03.569
Because, dear TEDsters,

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:06.331
if you are impatient like I am,

00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:09.889
you know that our economic competitors,

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:13.329
our other nations, are in the game

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:15.681
and are eating us for lunch.

00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:20.227
And we can get in the game or not.

00:12:20.227 --> 00:12:24.546
We can be at the table or we can be on the table.

00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:26.967
And I don't know about you,

00:12:26.967 --> 00:12:29.674
but I prefer to dine.

00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:33.674
Thank you all so much. (Applause)
