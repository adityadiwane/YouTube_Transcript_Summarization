00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.695
Charles Van Doren, who was later
a senior editor of Britannica,

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.896
said the ideal encyclopedia
should be radical --

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.456
it should stop being safe.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.696
But if you know anything about the history
of Britannica since 1962,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.056
it was anything but radical:

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.976
still a very completely safe,
stodgy type of encyclopedia.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.176
Wikipedia, on the other hand,
begins with a very radical idea,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.216
and that's for all of us
to imagine a world

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.256
in which every single person on the planet

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.856
is given free access
to the sum of all human knowledge.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.214
And that's what we're doing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.159
So Wikipedia --

00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:59.616
you just saw the little
demonstration of it --

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.736
it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.618
It's written by thousands of volunteers

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:05.642
all over the world
in many, many languages.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.056
It's written using wiki software --

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.636
which is the type of software
he just demonstrated --

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.375
so anyone can quickly edit and save,

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.495
and it goes live
on the Internet immediately.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.256
And everything about Wikipedia is managed
by virtually an all-volunteer staff.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.696
So when Yochai is talking
about new methods of organization,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.216
he's exactly describing Wikipedia.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.669
And what I'm going to do today

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:32.093
is tell you a little bit more
about how it really works on the inside.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.096
So Wikipedia's owned
by the Wikimedia Foundation,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.336
which I founded,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.776
a nonprofit organization.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.816
And our goal, the core aim
of the Wikimedia Foundation,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.016
is to get a free encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.056
And so, if you think
about what that means,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.616
it means a lot more
than just building a cool website.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.656
We're really interested
in all the issues of the digital divide,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.256
poverty worldwide,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.656
empowering people everywhere
to have the information that they need

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.896
to make good decisions.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.496
And so we're going
to have to do a lot of work

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.216
that goes beyond just the Internet.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.536
And so that's a big part of why
we've chosen the free licensing model,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.799
because that empowers local
entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --

00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:13.735
they can take our content
and do anything they like with it --

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.441
you can copy it, redistribute it --

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:17.877
and you can do it
commercially or non-commercially.

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.401
So there's a lot of opportunities
that are going to arise around Wikipedia

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:22.620
all over the world.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.496
We're funded by donations from the public,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.976
and one of the more
interesting things about that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.816
is how little money
it actually takes to run Wikipedia.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.376
So Yochai showed you the graph
of what the cost of a printing press was.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.736
And I'm going to tell you
what the cost of Wikipedia is.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.618
But first, I'll show you how big it is.

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:45.602
So we've got over 600,000
articles in English.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.496
We've got two million total articles
across many, many different languages.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.776
The biggest languages
are German, Japanese, French --

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.496
all the Western-European
languages are quite big.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.896
But only around one-third
of all of our traffic to our web

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.556
clusters to the English Wikipedia,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.438
which is surprising to a lot of people.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:07.816
A lot of people think in a very
English-centric way on the Internet,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.736
but for us, we're truly global.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.333
We're in many, many languages.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.016
How popular we've gotten to be --
we're a top-50 website

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.231
and we're more popular
than the New York Times.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:21.495
So this is where we get
to Yochai's discussion.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.296
This shows the growth of Wikipedia --
we're the blue line there --

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.016
and this is the New York Times over there.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.616
And what's interesting about this

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.976
is the New York Times website is a huge,
enormous corporate operation

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.496
with I have no idea
how many hundreds of employees.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.536
We have exactly one employee,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.176
and that employee
is our lead software developer.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.376
And he's only been our employee
since January 2005,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.216
all the other growth before that ...

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.856
So the servers are managed
by a ragtag band of volunteers.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.856
All the editing is done by volunteers.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.416
And the way that we're organized

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.123
is not like any traditional
organization you can imagine.

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:58.862
People are always asking,
"Well, who's in charge of this?"

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:00.056
or "Who does that?"

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.376
And the answer is:
anybody who wants to pitch in.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.880
It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.776
We've got over 90 servers now
in three locations.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.056
These are managed by volunteer
system administrators who are online.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.136
I can go online
any time of the day or night

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.456
and see eight to 10 people waiting for me

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.016
to ask a question or something,
anything about the servers.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.376
You could never afford
to do this in a company.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.616
You could never afford

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.376
to have a standby crew of people
24 hours a day

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.720
and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.696
So we're doing around
1.4 billion page views monthly,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.760
so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.736
And everything is managed
by the volunteers.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.976
And the total monthly cost
for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.936
And that's essentially our main cost.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.216
We could actually do without the employee.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.656
We hired Brian because he was
working part-time for two years

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.976
and full-time at Wikipedia,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.216
so we actually hired him,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.880
so he could get a life
and go to the movies sometimes.

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:05.336
So the big question when you've got
this really chaotic organization is,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.576
why isn't it all rubbish?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.520
Why is the website as good as it is?

00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:10.376
First of all, how good is it?

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.936
Well, it's pretty good.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.176
It isn't perfect,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.216
but it's much better
than you would expect,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.923
given our completely chaotic model.

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.963
So when you saw him make
a ridiculous edit to the page about me,

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:23.736
you think, "Oh, this is obviously
just going to degenerate into rubbish."

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.491
But when we've seen quality tests --

00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.531
and there haven't been enough of these yet

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:30.136
and I'm really encouraging
people to do more,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.296
comparing Wikipedia
to traditional things --

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.096
we win hands down.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.856
So a German magazine
compared German Wikipedia,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.216
which is much, much smaller than English,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.336
to Microsoft Encarta
and to Brockhaus multimedial,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.816
and we won across the board.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.221
They hired experts to come and look
at articles and compare the quality,

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:51.565
and we were very pleased with that result.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.856
So a lot of people have heard about
the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.536
The media has covered this
somewhat extensively.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.376
It started out
with an article in Red Herring.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.216
The reporters called me up and they --

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.216
I mean, I have to say
they spelled my name right,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.176
but they really wanted to say
the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.576
it's tearing apart
the Wikipedia community.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.096
And so they quote me as saying,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.016
"They're the most contentious
in the history of Wikipedia."

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.616
What I actually said
is they're not contentious at all.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.736
So it's a slight misquote.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.536
(Laughter)

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.576
The articles were edited quite heavily.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.056
And it is true that we did
have to lock the articles

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.416
on a couple of occasions.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.816
Time magazine recently reported that

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.856
"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.736
and Wales locked the entries
on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.016
This came after I told the reporter
that we had to lock it for --

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.176
occasionally a little bit here and there.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.576
So the truth in general
is that the kinds of controversies

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.791
that you would probably think
we have within the Wikipedia community

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.536
are not really controversies at all.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.056
Articles on controversial topics
are edited a lot,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.056
but they don't cause much controversy
within the community.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.800
And the reason for this is that most
people understand the need for neutrality.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.296
The real struggle is not
between the right and the left --

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.940
that's where most people assume --

00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:18.016
but it's between
the party of the thoughtful

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.336
and the party of the jerks.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.176
And no side of the political spectrum

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.656
has a monopoly
on either of those qualities.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.256
The actual truth
about the specific Bush-Kerry incident

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.256
is that the Bush-Kerry articles

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.256
were locked less than one percent
of the time in 2004,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.336
and it wasn't because
they were contentious;

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.696
it was just because
there was routine vandalism --

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.416
which happens sometimes even on stage ...

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.576
(Laughter)

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.136
Sometimes even reporters have reported
to me that they vandalized Wikipedia

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.496
and were amazed
that it was fixed so quickly.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.296
And I said -- you know, I always say,
please don't do that.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.896
That's not a good thing.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.416
So how do we do this?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.296
How do we manage the quality control?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.520
How does it work?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.816
So there's a few elements,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.096
mostly social policies
and some elements of the software.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.856
So the biggest
and the most important thing

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.611
is our neutral point of view policy.

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.397
This is something
that I set down, from the very beginning,

00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:15.456
as a core principle of the community
that's completely not debatable.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.376
It's a social concept of cooperation,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.896
so we don't talk a lot
about truth and objectivity.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.976
The reason for this is if we say

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.576
we're only going to write
the "truth" about some topic,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.807
that doesn't do us a damn bit of good
of figuring out what to write,

00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:32.367
because I don't agree with you
about what's the truth.

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.736
But we have this
jargon term of neutrality,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.216
which has its own long history
within the community,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.656
which basically says,
any time there's a controversial issue,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.256
Wikipedia itself should not
take a stand on the issue.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.519
We should merely report on what
reputable parties have said about it.

00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:49.616
So this neutrality policy
is really important for us

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.896
because it empowers a community
that is very diverse

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.216
to come together
and actually get some work done.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.376
So we have very diverse contributors

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.616
in terms of political,
religious, cultural backgrounds.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.456
By having this firm neutrality policy,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.496
which is non-negotiable
from the beginning,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.378
we ensure that people can work together

00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:08.616
and that the entries
don't become simply a war

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.783
back and forth
between the left and the right.

00:09:10.807 --> 00:09:14.522
If you engage in that type of behavior,
you'll be asked to leave the community.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.696
So, real-time peer review.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.856
Every single change on the site
goes to the "Recent changes" page.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.376
So as soon as he made his change,
it went to the "Recent changes" page.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.376
That recent changes page
was also fed into an IRC channel,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.976
which is an Internet chat channel

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.200
that people are monitoring
with various software tools.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.376
And people can get RSS feeds --

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.496
they can get email
notifications of changes.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.176
And then users can set up
their own personal watch list.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.693
So my page is on quite a few
volunteers' watch lists,

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.413
because it is sometimes vandalized.

00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:52.416
And therefore, what happens is someone
will notice the change very quickly,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.816
and then they'll just
simply revert the change.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.756
There's a "new pages feed," for example,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.836
so you can go
to a certain page of Wikipedia

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.788
and see every new page as it's created.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.970
This is really important

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.196
because a lot of new pages
are just garbage that has to be deleted,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.456
you know, "ASDFASDF."

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.396
But also, that's some
of the most interesting and fun things,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.636
some of the new articles.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.236
People will start an article
on some interesting topic,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.076
other people will find that intriguing

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.496
and jump in and help
and make it much better.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.416
So we do have edits by anonymous users,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.296
which is one of the most controversial
and intriguing things about Wikipedia.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.936
So, Chris was able to do his change --
he didn't have to log in or anything;

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.776
he just went on the website
and made a change.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.856
But it turns out
that only about 18 percent

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.376
of all the edits to the website

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.736
are done by anonymous users.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.096
And that's a really important
thing to understand:

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.376
the vast majority of the edits
that go on on the website

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.096
are from a very close-knit community
of maybe 600 to 1,000 people

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.740
who are in constant communication.

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:49.336
And we have over 40 IRC channels,
40 mailing lists.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.936
All these people know each other.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.008
They communicate.
We have off-line meetings.

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:55.652
These are the people
who are doing the bulk of the site,

00:10:55.676 --> 00:11:00.324
and they are, in a sense,
semi-professionals at what they're doing.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.296
The standards we set for ourselves

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.376
are equal to or higher
than professional standards of quality.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.916
We don't always meet those standards,
but that's what we're striving for.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.798
And so that tight community
is who really cares for the site,

00:11:12.822 --> 00:11:15.456
and these are some
of the smartest people I've ever met.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.736
It's my job to say that,
but it's actually true.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.496
The type of people who were drawn
to writing an encyclopedia for fun

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.856
tend to be pretty smart people.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.976
The tools and the software:
there's lots of tools that allow us --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.620
allow us, meaning the community --

00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:30.696
to self-monitor
and to monitor all the work.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.216
This is an example
of a page history on "flat Earth,"

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.296
and you can see some changes
that were made.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.616
What's nice about this page
is you can immediately take a look at this

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.216
and see, "OK, I understand now."

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.016
When somebody goes and looks at --

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.183
they see that someone,
an anonymous IP number,

00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:45.696
made an edit to my page.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.776
That sounds suspicious.
Who is this person?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.016
Somebody looks at it --

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.056
they can immediately see
highlighted in red

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.976
all of the changes that took place --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.616
to see, OK, well, these words
have changed, things like this.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.260
So that's one tool that we can use

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:00.804
to very quickly monitor
the history of a page.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.816
Another thing that we do
within the community

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.216
is we leave everything very open-ended.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.616
Most of the social rules
and the methods of work

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.056
are left completely open-ended
in the software.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.096
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.216
And so there's nothing
in the software that enforces the rules.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.256
The example I've got up here
is the Votes for Deletion page.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.856
So, I mentioned earlier,
people type "ASDFASDF" --

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.096
it needs to be deleted.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.596
Cases like that,
the administrators just delete it.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.956
There's no reason
to have a big argument about it.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.315
But you can imagine there's a lot
of other areas where the question is,

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:36.579
is this notable enough
to go in an encyclopedia?

00:12:36.603 --> 00:12:40.176
Is the information verifiable?
Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.256
So we needed a social method
for figuring out the answer to this.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.138
And so the method that arose
organically within the community

00:12:46.162 --> 00:12:47.736
is the Votes For Deletion page.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.776
And in the particular
example we have here,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.296
it's a film, "Twisted Issues,"

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.776
and the first person says,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.496
"Now this is supposedly a film.
It fails the Google test miserably."

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.336
The Google test is you look in Google
and see if it's there,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.256
because if something's not even in Google,
it probably doesn't exist at all.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.856
It's not a perfect rule,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.216
but it's a nice starting point
for quick research.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.495
So somebody says, "Delete it, please.
Delete it -- it's not notable."

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:14.535
And then somebody says,
"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:17.816
'Film Threat Video Guide:
the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.745
So the next persons says, "Clean it up."

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:23.176
Somebody says, "I've found it on IMDB.
Keep, keep, keep."

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.016
And what's interesting about this
is that the software is --

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.576
these votes are just text
typed into a page.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.656
This is not really a vote
so much as it is a dialogue.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.416
Now it is true that at the end of the day,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.679
an administrator can go through here
and take a look at this and say,

00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:42.176
"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:
we'll delete it."

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.976
But in other cases,
this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.796
and we would keep it,
because if those last two keeps say,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.725
"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this
but I found it in a book,

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.947
and I found a link
to a page that describes it,

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:57.067
and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,
so please don't delete it,"

00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:58.276
then it would survive.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.896
And it also matters
who the people are who are voting.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.825
Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.

00:14:02.849 --> 00:14:05.376
Down here at the bottom,
"Keep, real movie," RickK.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.781
RickK is a very famous Wikipedian
who does an enormous amount of work

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.536
with vandalism, hoaxes
and votes for deletion.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.376
His voice carries a lot of weight
within the community

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.972
because he knows what he's doing.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.336
So how is all this governed?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.496
People really want to know
about administrators, things like that.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.376
So the Wikipedia governance model,
the governance of the community,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.816
is a very confusing,
but workable mix of consensus --

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.376
meaning we try not to vote
on the content of articles,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.296
because the majority view
is not necessarily neutral --

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.616
some amount of democracy --

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.976
all of the administrators --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.796
these are the people
who have the ability to delete pages.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.656
That doesn't mean that they have
the right to delete pages.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.516
They still have to follow all the rules --
but they're elected by the community.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.970
Sometimes people --
random trolls on the Internet --

00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:54.377
like to accuse me
of handpicking the administrators

00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:56.306
to bias the content of the encyclopedia.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.096
I always laugh at this, because I have
no idea how they're elected, actually.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.096
There's a certain amount of aristocracy.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.263
You got a hint of that
when I mentioned, like,

00:15:04.287 --> 00:15:06.439
RickK's voice would carry
a lot more weight

00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:07.759
than someone we don't know.

00:15:07.783 --> 00:15:10.496
I give this talk sometimes with Angela,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.251
who was just re-elected to the board
from the community --

00:15:13.275 --> 00:15:14.771
to the Board of the Foundation,

00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:17.936
with more than twice the votes
of the person who didn't make it.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.896
And I always embarrass her because I say,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.216
"Well, Angela, for example,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.656
could get away with doing
absolutely anything within Wikipedia,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.696
because she's so admired and so powerful."

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.536
But the irony is, of course, that Angela
can do this because she's the one person

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.536
who you know would never, ever
break any rules of Wikipedia.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.616
And I also like to say
she's the only person

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.856
who actually knows
all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.119
And then there's monarchy,

00:15:41.143 --> 00:15:43.159
and that's my role
on the community, so ...

00:15:43.183 --> 00:15:45.576
(Laughter)

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.216
I was describing this in Berlin once,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.016
and the next day
in the newspaper the headline said,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.608
"I am the Queen of England."

00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:53.783
(Laughter)

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:56.176
And that's not exactly what I said, but --

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.696
(Laughter)

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.296
the point is my role in the community --

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.016
Within the free software world,
there's been a long-standing tradition

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.256
of the "benevolent dictator" model.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.136
So if you look at most
of the major free software projects,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.936
they have one single person in charge

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.296
who everyone agrees
is the benevolent dictator.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.816
Well, I don't like the term
"benevolent dictator,"

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.816
and I don't think that it's my job
or my role in the world of ideas

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.176
to be the dictator of the future
of all human knowledge

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.416
compiled by the world.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.136
It just isn't appropriate.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.936
But there is a need still
for a certain amount of monarchy,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.536
a certain amount of --

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.336
sometimes we have to make a decision

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.599
and we don't want
to get bogged down too heavily

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:40.336
in formal decision-making processes.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.256
So as an example
of how this can be important:

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.256
we recently had a situation where
a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.136
and they said,
"Oh, well, this is horrible,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.056
this Jewish conspiracy of a website,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.239
and we're going to get certain articles
deleted that we don't like.

00:16:57.263 --> 00:17:00.263
And we see they have a voting process,
so we're going to send --

00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:03.096
we have 40,000 members
and we're going to send them over

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.898
and they're all going to vote
and get these pages deleted."

00:17:05.922 --> 00:17:08.113
Well, they managed
to get 18 people to show up.

00:17:08.137 --> 00:17:10.896
That's neo-Nazi math for you.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.376
They always think they've got
40,000 members when they've got 18.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.896
But they managed to get 18 people
to come and vote in a fairly absurd way

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.936
to delete a perfectly valid article.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.696
Of course, the vote ended up
being about 85 to 18,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.976
so there was no real danger
to our democratic processes.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.295
On the other hand, people said,
"But what are we going to do?

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:30.575
I mean, this could happen.

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.936
What if some group
gets really seriously organized

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.536
and comes in and wants to vote?"

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.335
Then I said, "Well, fuck it,
we'll just change the rules."

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:40.055
That's my job in the community:

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:43.656
to say we won't allow
our openness and freedom

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.256
to undermine the quality of the content.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.575
And so, as long as people
trust me in my role,

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:51.456
then that's a valid place for me.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.516
Of course, because of the free licensing,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.017
if I do a bad job, the volunteers
are more than happy to take and leave --

00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.521
I can't tell anyone what to do.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.696
So the final point here
is that to understand how Wikipedia works,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.911
it's important to understand
that our wiki model is the way we work,

00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:10.536
but we are not fanatical web anarchists.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.936
In fact, we're very flexible
about the social methodology,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.376
because ultimately,
the passion of the community

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.416
is for the quality of the work,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.416
not necessarily for the process
that we use to generate it.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.656
Thank you.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.936
(Applause)

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.736
Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.896
Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality
being a key to Wikipedia's success.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.256
It strikes me that much of the textbooks
that are used to educate our children

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.056
are inherently biased.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.696
Have you found Wikipedia
being used by teachers

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.176
and how do you see Wikipedia
changing education?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.416
Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers
are beginning to use Wikipedia.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.016
There's a media storyline about Wikipedia,
which I think is false.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.616
It builds on the storyline
of bloggers versus newspapers.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.776
And the storyline is,
there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.256
but academics hate it
and teachers hate it.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.856
And that turns out to not be true.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.416
The last time I got an email
from a journalist saying,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.156
"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.038
I sent it from my Harvard email address

00:19:14.062 --> 00:19:16.315
because I was recently
appointed a fellow there.

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.355
And I said, "Well,
they don't all hate it."

00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:19.456
(Laughter)

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.336
But I think there's going
to be huge impacts.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.776
And we actually have a project
that I'm personally really excited about,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.296
which is the Wikibooks project,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.416
which is an effort to create
textbooks in all the languages.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.016
And that's a much bigger project.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.656
It's going to take 20 years or so
to come to fruition.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.696
But part of that is to fulfill our mission

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.696
of giving an encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.576
We don't mean we're going
to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.396
We mean we're going to give them
a tool that they can use.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.196
And for a lot of people in the world,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.396
if I give you an encyclopedia
that's written at a university level,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.976
it doesn't do you any good
without a whole host of literacy materials

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.776
to build you up to the point
where you can actually use it.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.943
The Wikibooks project
is an effort to do that.

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:04.176
And I think that we're going to see --
it may not even come from us;

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.176
there's all kinds of innovation going on.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.360
But freely licensed textbooks
are the next big thing in education.
