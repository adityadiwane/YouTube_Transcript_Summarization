00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
So, can we dare to be optimistic?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.330
is that a billion people have been stuck living

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.330
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.330
It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.330
That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.330
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.330
that have not offered credible hope.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
That is a human tragedy.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.330
continues for another 40 years,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.330
combined with social integration globally,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.330
it will build a nightmare for our children.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.330
We need compassion to get ourselves started,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.330
and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
That's the alliance that changes the world.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.330
So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
What can we actually do?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
Well, a good guide is to think,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
"What did we do last time the rich world got serious

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
about developing another region of the world?"

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
except you have to go back quite a long time.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330
The last time the rich world got serious

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.330
about developing another region was in the late 1940s.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.330
The rich world was you, America,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.330
and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
That was post-War Europe.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
Why did America get serious?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.330
It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
It was that you knew you had to,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.330
because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.330
was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Europe had to be dragged into economic development.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.330
So, what did you do, last time you got serious?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.330
Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
But what else did you do?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.330
Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.330
After the war, you opened your markets to Europe,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
and you institutionalized that trade liberalization

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.330
through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
So, total reversal of trade policy.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Did you do anything else?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.330
After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330
for over 40 years.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.330
So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
national sovereignty.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.330
Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
After the war, you found the United Nations,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.330
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.330
you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
all systems for mutual government support.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.330
That is still the waterfront of effective policies:

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
aid, trade, security, governments.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
Of course, the details of policy are going to be different,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.330
because the challenge is different.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.330
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
Is that easier or harder?

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.330
We need to be at least as serious as we were then.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.330
Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
governments, mutual systems of support for governments --

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
and I'm going to show you one idea

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.330
in how we could do something to strengthen governance,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.330
and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.330
The opportunity we're going to look to

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.330
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.330
and that is the commodity booms.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.330
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.330
into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:21.330
but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.330
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.330
Ghana has discovered oil;

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.330
Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.330
So, a mass of new discoveries.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
Just to give you one example:

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.330
Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.330
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.330
So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.330
to the bottom billion are without precedent.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
So there's the optimism.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.330
The question is, how is it going to help their development?

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.330
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
Will it be taken?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.330
So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.330
I've looked to see what is the relationship between

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.330
higher commodity prices of exports,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.330
and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
for the last 40 years,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
and looked to see what the relationship is.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:51.330
And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.330
In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.330
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.330
but also that drives up output across the board.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.330
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.330
And how about the long run?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.330
Come back 15 years later.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.330
Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.330
but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.330
You go up in the short run, but then most societies

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.330
historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.330
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.330
it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.330
for growth of an increase in prices.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.330
So, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.330
that the critical issue is the level of governance,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.330
the initial level of economic governance,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.330
when the resource booms accrue.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.330
In fact, if you've got good enough governance,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330
there is no resource boom.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.330
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:13.330
That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.330
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
below a threshold of governance.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
They still go up in the short run.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.330
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.330
The best growth rates they've had -- ever.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And the question is whether the short run will persist.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:44.330
It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.330
So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
and below which you go down.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
Just to benchmark that threshold,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:10:00.330
it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.330
So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.330
Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
and that is the spread of democracy.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
which has transformed governance in the bottom billion.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.330
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
and unfortunately, they're adverse.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:35.330
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.330
(Laughter)

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.330
-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.330
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.330
there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:58.330
and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.330
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
that's doing the damage with democracy,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.330
whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
is very strong checks and balances.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
They haven't got them.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.330
They got instant democracy in the 1990s:

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
elections without checks and balances.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.330
How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.330
In all the societies of the bottom billion,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.330
there are intense struggles to do just that.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.330
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.330
which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.330
that need to be taken in order

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.330
to harness these resource revenues.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.330
We know these international standards work

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.330
because we've already got one.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.330
That is the very simple idea that governments should report

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
to their citizens what revenues they have.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.330
No sooner was it proposed

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:13.330
than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.330
Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
People wanted to know what their government was getting

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
in terms of revenue.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:28.330
So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.330
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.330
and putting assets on top of the ground.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.330
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.330
how they've been sold over the last 40 years?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.330
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.330
And that's great for the company,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.330
and it's quite often great for the minister --

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.330
(Laughter)

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.330
-- and it's not great for their country.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.330
There's a very simple institutional technology

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
which can transform that,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.330
and it's called verified auctions.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:20.330
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.330
is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.330
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.330
to third-generation mobile phones

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.330
by working out what those rights were worth.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.330
"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.330
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.330
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.330
think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.330
(Laughter)

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.330
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.330
the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.330
to give expertise on how to conduct auctions.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.330
There are five such decision points;

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.330
each one needs an international standard.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.330
If we could do it, we would change the world.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.330
We would be helping the reformers in these societies,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.330
who are struggling for change.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.330
That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.330
but we can help the people in these societies

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.330
who are struggling and usually failing,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:34.330
because the odds are so stacked against them.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
And yet, we've not got these rules.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.330
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.330
is zilch -- nothing.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.330
Why on Earth are they not there?

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.330
I realized that the reason they're not there

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:58.330
is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
politicians will get away with gestures.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.330
That unless we have an informed society,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:12.330
what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
things that look good, but don't work.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330
And so I realized we had to go through the business

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.330
of building an informed citizenry.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.330
That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.330
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.330
(Laughter).

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.330
However, I have to say, the process of communication

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
does not come naturally to me.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.330
This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:53.330
I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.330
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:03.330
and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.330
(Laughter)

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.330
-- but his arguments are compelling."

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.330
(Laughter)

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:20.330
(Applause)

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
If you agree with that sentiment,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:29.330
and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.330
you will realize that I need you.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.330
Please, become ambassadors.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
Thank you.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:50.330
(Applause)
