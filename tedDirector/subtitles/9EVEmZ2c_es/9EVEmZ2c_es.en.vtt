00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.604
"Even in purely non-religious terms,

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:22.659
homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.285
It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality --

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.685
a pitiable flight from life.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:33.508
As such, it deserves no compassion,

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.070
it deserves no treatment

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.837
as minority martyrdom,

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:45.515
and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:50.737
That's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:54.651
And last year, the president of the United States

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:57.234
came out in favor of gay marriage.

00:00:57.234 --> 00:01:04.683
(Applause)

00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:10.385
And my question is, how did we get from there to here?

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:15.125
How did an illness become an identity?

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.085
When I was perhaps six years old,

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:21.018
I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.425
And at the end of buying our shoes,

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:27.217
the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:32.883
My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:37.798
My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.934
But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:46.353
And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:51.143
The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay --

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:54.251
(Laughter) --

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:58.623
is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.690
(Laughter)

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.557
(Applause)

00:02:07.557 --> 00:02:10.098
When I was little, my mother used to say,

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:14.650
"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.995
And until you have children, you don't know what it's like."

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:21.189
And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.009
that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.637
And when I was an adolescent, I thought

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:30.001
that I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.378
And when she said it, it made me anxious.

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:33.904
And after I came out of the closet,

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:37.104
when she continued to say it, it made me furious.

00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:41.245
I said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.

00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:44.290
And I want you to stop saying that."

00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:52.070
About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.511
to write a piece about deaf culture.

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.348
And I was rather taken aback.

00:02:56.348 --> 00:02:58.543
I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.

00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:00.269
Those poor people, they couldn't hear.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.043
They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?

00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:05.160
And then I went out into the deaf world.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.551
I went to deaf clubs.

00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:11.471
I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.

00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:17.682
I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee

00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:21.526
where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:25.782
(Laughter)

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:29.709
And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.715
I become convinced that deafness was a culture

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:35.077
and that the people in the deaf world who said,

00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:38.444
"We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:41.021
were saying something that was viable.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.526
It wasn't my culture,

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:45.244
and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,

00:03:45.244 --> 00:03:48.075
but I appreciated that it was a culture

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:50.210
and that for the people who were members of it,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.499
it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.499
It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.913
Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:06.392
And when her daughter was born,

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:08.708
she suddenly found herself confronting questions

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:11.510
that now began to seem quite resonant to me.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.377
She was facing the question of what to do with this child.

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:18.837
Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"

00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:22.052
Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.599
get involved in the Little People of America,

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.392
become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.993
And I suddenly thought,

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:31.212
most deaf children are born to hearing parents.

00:04:31.212 --> 00:04:34.011
Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.

00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:38.177
Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.526
Most gay people are born to straight parents.

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:42.974
Those straight parents often want them to function

00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:45.244
in what they think of as the mainstream world,

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:48.848
and those gay people have to discover identity later on.

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:50.464
And here was this friend of mine

00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:53.793
looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.569
And I thought, there it is again:

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.135
A family that perceives itself to be normal

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.505
with a child who seems to be extraordinary.

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:05.017
And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.

00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:06.941
There are vertical identities,

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.923
which are passed down generationally from parent to child.

00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:15.526
Those are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:20.004
Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.

00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.277
And while some of them can be difficult,

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.471
there's no attempt to cure them.

00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:27.883
You can argue that it's harder in the United States --

00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:29.857
our current presidency notwithstanding --

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:31.690
to be a person of color.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.389
And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.277
that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians

00:05:38.277 --> 00:05:41.666
come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:45.943
There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.

00:05:45.943 --> 00:05:48.241
And I call them horizontal identities,

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:51.136
because the peer group is the horizontal experience.

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:53.704
These are identities that are alien to your parents

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.889
and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.974
And those identities, those horizontal identities,

00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:04.690
people have almost always tried to cure.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.358
And I wanted to look at what the process is

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:09.575
through which people who have those identities

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:12.303
come to a good relationship with them.

00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:16.556
And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance

00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:17.995
that needed to take place.

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:23.544
There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.

00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:25.491
And they don't always coincide.

00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.627
And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:32.691
because they feel as though their parents don't love them,

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:36.990
when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.156
Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:43.203
throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:46.469
But acceptance is something that takes time.

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.704
It always takes time.

00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:53.596
One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:56.998
When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,

00:06:56.998 --> 00:06:58.776
a very disabling condition,

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:02.182
and his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,

00:07:02.182 --> 00:07:04.157
he would have no intellectual capacity,

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.856
and he would probably not even recognize them.

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:10.277
And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital

00:07:10.277 --> 00:07:12.491
so that he could die there quietly.

00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:14.455
And his mother said she wasn't going to do it.

00:07:14.455 --> 00:07:16.222
And she took her son home.

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:19.856
And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.804
she found the best doctor in the country

00:07:21.804 --> 00:07:24.003
for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,

00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:26.169
and she got Clinton enrolled with him.

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.250
And in the course of his childhood,

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.323
he had 30 major surgical procedures.

00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.510
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.203
while he was having those procedures,

00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:37.611
as a result of which he now can walk.

00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:41.961
And while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.790
And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.537
And he ended up achieving at a level

00:07:46.537 --> 00:07:50.112
that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.

00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:53.442
He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,

00:07:53.442 --> 00:07:56.824
where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car

00:07:56.824 --> 00:07:59.608
that accommodated his unusual body.

00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:02.571
And his mother told me this story of coming home one day --

00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.336
and he went to college nearby --

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:07.423
and she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:11.846
in the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter)

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:16.456
"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:18.756
Two beers for them is four beers for him."

00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:21.369
She said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:25.557
but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."

00:08:25.557 --> 00:08:27.042
She said, "And then I thought,

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:29.142
if someone had said to me when he was born

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:34.755
that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- "

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:43.537
(Applause)

00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:45.576
And I said to her, "What do you think you did

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:50.036
that helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"

00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:54.723
And she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.

00:08:54.723 --> 00:08:57.859
Clinton just always had that light in him.

00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:04.272
And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:07.310
I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:13.004
This one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America --

00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:15.808
written by an important bioethicist.

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:19.616
He said, "There is no reason to feel guilty

00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:22.921
about putting a Down syndrome child away,

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:27.980
whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.889
or in a more responsible, lethal sense.

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:36.837
It is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.

00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.937
True guilt arises only from an offense against a person,

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:45.538
and a Down's is not a person."

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:49.479
There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:51.606
in the treatment of gay people.

00:09:51.606 --> 00:09:55.642
The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.

00:09:55.642 --> 00:10:00.338
But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,

00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:02.476
how we used to see people who were disabled,

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.389
how inhuman we held people to be.

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:07.267
And the change that's been accomplished there,

00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:09.093
which is almost equally radical,

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:11.969
is one that we pay not very much attention to.

00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:15.921
One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,

00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:19.649
were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:23.104
their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.

00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:27.190
They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.043
and so they decided they would build a little center --

00:10:31.043 --> 00:10:34.707
two classrooms that they started with a few other parents --

00:10:34.707 --> 00:10:37.170
to educate kids with D.S.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.070
And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.227
where there are now thousands upon thousands

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:47.004
of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.

00:10:47.004 --> 00:10:50.142
In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,

00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:54.315
the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:59.074
The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,

00:10:59.074 --> 00:11:05.127
those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.

00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:07.002
The Robards had a lot to do with that.

00:11:07.002 --> 00:11:08.536
And I said, "Do you regret it?

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:11.139
Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:12.988
Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"

00:11:12.988 --> 00:11:15.355
And interestingly his father said,

00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:17.942
"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,

00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:21.322
because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,

00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:24.070
and I'd like to give David an easier life.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.170
But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.601
And Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.

00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:36.542
For David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:41.978
But speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:43.988
that I could come to such a point --

00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:48.336
speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder

00:11:48.336 --> 00:11:51.370
and so much more purposeful in my whole life,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.779
that speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:02.164
We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.902
is on the up and up.

00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:05.738
And yet we also live at the moment

00:12:05.738 --> 00:12:08.629
when our ability to eliminate those conditions

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:11.237
has reached a height we never imagined before.

00:12:11.237 --> 00:12:14.381
Most deaf infants born in the United States now

00:12:14.396 --> 00:12:16.189
will receive Cochlear implants,

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:21.004
which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,

00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:26.022
and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.

00:12:26.022 --> 00:12:30.321
A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,

00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:35.374
is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.

00:12:35.374 --> 00:12:38.119
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,

00:12:38.119 --> 00:12:42.086
and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:44.004
grow to full size.

00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:46.555
Testing in humans is around the corner.

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:48.811
There are blood tests which are making progress

00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:54.306
that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:59.535
making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.870
or to terminate them.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.537
And so we have both social progress and medical progress.

00:13:05.537 --> 00:13:07.389
And I believe in both of them.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:11.444
I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,

00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:14.540
and I think the same thing about the medical progress.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.903
But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.

00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:20.974
And when I see the way they're intersecting

00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:23.188
in conditions like the three I've just described,

00:13:23.188 --> 00:13:26.838
I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera

00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:29.442
when the hero realizes he loves the heroine

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:33.889
at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:36.688
(Laughter)

00:13:36.688 --> 00:13:40.570
We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.436
And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,

00:13:43.436 --> 00:13:45.288
what do we validate in our children,

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:47.040
and what do we cure in them?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.211
Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,

00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:55.865
"When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,'

00:13:55.865 --> 00:14:00.724
what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist

00:14:00.724 --> 00:14:04.743
and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.'

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:09.535
Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.

00:14:09.535 --> 00:14:12.737
This is what we hear when you pray for a cure --

00:14:12.737 --> 00:14:14.642
that your fondest wish for us

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:17.021
is that someday we will cease to be

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:22.576
and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."

00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:25.642
It's a very extreme point of view,

00:14:25.642 --> 00:14:29.771
but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have

00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:34.336
and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:37.556
They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.

00:14:37.556 --> 00:14:41.356
One of the families I interviewed for this project

00:14:41.356 --> 00:14:46.610
was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.405
It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,

00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:52.169
and once they agreed, they were so full of their story

00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:53.868
that they couldn't stop telling it.

00:14:53.868 --> 00:14:56.485
And the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many --

00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:59.606
I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.

00:14:59.606 --> 00:15:01.869
And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:04.755
We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.

00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:07.276
And I said, "If Dylan were here now,

00:15:07.276 --> 00:15:10.121
do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"

00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:12.489
And his father said, "I sure do.

00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:16.038
I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."

00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:19.676
And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.

00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:21.855
And then she looked back up and said,

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:25.918
"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:30.342
and never knowing what was going on inside his head."

00:15:30.342 --> 00:15:33.310
When I had dinner with her a couple of years later --

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.237
one of many dinners that we had together --

00:15:35.237 --> 00:15:38.647
she said, "You know, when it first happened,

00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:42.455
I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.

00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:45.947
If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,

00:15:45.947 --> 00:15:49.589
this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.

00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:54.104
But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much

00:15:54.104 --> 00:15:57.407
that I don't want to imagine a life without them.

00:15:57.407 --> 00:16:02.336
I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.800
but the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.592
"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world

00:16:09.592 --> 00:16:12.102
if Dylan had never been born,

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:17.584
I've decided that it would not have been better for me."

00:16:17.584 --> 00:16:24.068
I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,

00:16:24.068 --> 00:16:27.101
problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,

00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:30.920
and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.121
And then I thought, all of us who have children

00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:36.813
love the children we have, with their flaws.

00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:41.069
If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling

00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:43.279
and offered to take away the children I have

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:49.873
and give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --

00:16:49.873 --> 00:16:54.978
I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.

00:16:54.978 --> 00:16:56.970
And ultimately I feel

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.548
that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno

00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:05.020
to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.088
so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences

00:17:09.088 --> 00:17:11.769
reflect on the universal experience of parenting,

00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:15.903
which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,

00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:18.092
where did you come from?

00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:20.546
(Laughter)

00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:25.521
It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --

00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:28.066
there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,

00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:30.703
there are only so many families of children who are transgender,

00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:32.897
there are only so many families of prodigies --

00:17:32.897 --> 00:17:35.181
who also face similar challenges in many ways --

00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.871
there are only so many families in each of those categories --

00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:39.303
but if you start to think

00:17:39.303 --> 00:17:42.869
that the experience of negotiating difference within your family

00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:44.899
is what people are addressing,

00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:48.636
then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.

00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:53.271
Ironically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,

00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:55.699
that unite us.

00:17:55.699 --> 00:18:01.013
I decided to have children while I was working on this project.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:04.129
And many people were astonished and said,

00:18:04.129 --> 00:18:05.977
"But how can you decide to have children

00:18:05.977 --> 00:18:10.083
in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:13.313
And I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.

00:18:13.313 --> 00:18:16.404
What I'm studying is how much love there can be,

00:18:16.404 --> 00:18:21.129
even when everything appears to be going wrong."

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:26.764
I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,

00:18:26.764 --> 00:18:30.536
a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.

00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:33.346
And when his ashes were interred, his mother said,

00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:41.380
"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.436
once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."

00:18:47.436 --> 00:18:52.072
And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child

00:18:52.072 --> 00:18:54.604
if they had the effective will to do so.

00:18:54.604 --> 00:18:59.629
So my husband is the biological father of two children

00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:02.390
with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:08.214
I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:10.112
And so she and I have a daughter,

00:19:10.112 --> 00:19:12.323
and mother and daughter live in Texas.

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:15.562
And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time

00:19:15.562 --> 00:19:17.946
of whom I am the biological father,

00:19:17.946 --> 00:19:21.866
and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,

00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:24.929
the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:33.584
(Applause)

00:19:33.584 --> 00:19:39.048
So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.

00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:42.404
And there are people who think that the existence of my family

00:19:42.404 --> 00:19:47.069
somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.

00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:50.697
And there are people who think that families like mine

00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:52.381
shouldn't be allowed to exist.

00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:58.036
And I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.

00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:01.562
And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity

00:20:01.562 --> 00:20:03.813
to ensure that the planet can go on,

00:20:03.813 --> 00:20:08.014
so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family

00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:12.695
in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.

00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:15.065
The day after our son was born,

00:20:15.065 --> 00:20:19.637
the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.

00:20:19.637 --> 00:20:22.770
He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.679
She said that might mean that he had brain damage.

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:29.040
In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.903
which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.

00:20:32.903 --> 00:20:37.686
And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.

00:20:37.686 --> 00:20:39.316
And as she told me all of these things,

00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:43.311
I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.

00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:45.654
And I thought, here I had been working for years

00:20:45.654 --> 00:20:48.203
on a book about how much meaning people had found

00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:51.736
in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:55.636
and I didn't want to join their number.

00:20:55.636 --> 00:20:58.331
Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.

00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:00.581
And like all parents since the dawn of time,

00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.927
I wanted to protect my child from illness.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:07.138
And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.

00:21:07.138 --> 00:21:09.698
And yet, I knew from the work I had done

00:21:09.698 --> 00:21:13.805
that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:16.878
that those would ultimately be his identity,

00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:21.112
and if they were his identity they would become my identity,

00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:25.269
that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:28.300
We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.298
we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.

00:21:32.298 --> 00:21:33.492
We felt helpless.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.970
And at the end of five hours,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.194
they said that his brain was completely clear

00:21:37.194 --> 00:21:40.204
and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.

00:21:40.204 --> 00:21:43.136
And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:47.471
she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.

00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:51.036
(Laughter)

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:58.869
But I thought how my mother was right.

00:21:58.869 --> 00:22:02.364
I thought, the love you have for your children

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:05.694
is unlike any other feeling in the world,

00:22:05.694 --> 00:22:11.858
and until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.

00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:14.179
I think children had ensnared me

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:17.705
the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.

00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:19.637
But I'm not sure I would have noticed that

00:22:19.637 --> 00:22:25.162
if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.

00:22:25.162 --> 00:22:28.394
I'd encountered so much strange love,

00:22:28.394 --> 00:22:32.179
and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:38.906
And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.

00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:42.712
During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned

00:22:42.712 --> 00:22:46.204
the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,

00:22:46.204 --> 00:22:49.736
and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.

00:22:49.736 --> 00:22:54.037
And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,

00:22:54.037 --> 00:22:58.987
enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children

00:22:58.987 --> 00:23:01.936
and trying to breed identity out of misery,

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:06.572
I realized that day that my research had built me a plank

00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:09.986
and that I was ready to join them on their ship.

00:23:09.986 --> 00:23:11.803
Thank you.

00:23:11.803 --> 00:23:17.454
