00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
So I thought, "I will talk about death."

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Seemed to be the passion today.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Actually, it's not about death.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
That's what I want to talk about.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.160
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
that appeared soon after he died, saying,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.160
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
his journey through cancer.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
through letters and a notebook.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
and gentle suggestions for improvement,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.160
quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Handwriting is a disappearing art.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm all for email and thinking while typing,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
but why give up old habits for new?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.160
There are times when I want to trade all those years

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160
that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and trade all those years for one hug.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
But too late.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.160
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
and I feel connected to him.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
So maybe we all need to leave our children

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
with a value legacy, and not a financial one.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
A value for things with a personal touch --

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160
an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.160
where our children may go to penmanship classes.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.160
So what do I plan to leave for my son?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
in the audience know I hound you for them --

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
and CDs too, Tracy.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.160
I plan to publish my own notebook.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I have no idea how I'm going to do it,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160
but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
into a book, and leave that published book for my son.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160
at my father's cremation.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160
because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
I took it out for the first time to come here.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
boundless energy confined in the bottle,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
forcing me to deal with reality,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
forcing me to deal with being grown up.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.160
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.160
on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
just as you taught me.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.160
holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
to live again and to love again."

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Thank you.
