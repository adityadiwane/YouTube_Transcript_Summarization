00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:17.911
I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.112
I understand we have over 80 countries here,

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:23.326
so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak

00:00:23.326 --> 00:00:24.705
to all of these countries.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.690
In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.811
the parent-teacher conference.

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:30.925
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:33.325
Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:36.143
where your parents come to school and your teacher

00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:38.641
talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:41.982
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:44.838
where my father, who never takes off from work,

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:48.768
he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person,

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:51.928
going to school to see his son, how he's doing,

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:54.435
and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know,

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:56.710
John is good at math and art."

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.772
And he kind of nodded, you know?

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:01.142
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:04.937
tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:08.228
(Laughter)

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:10.659
And that always stuck with me all my life.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.516
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:16.922
Why? It became a question my entire life, and

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:19.839
that's all right, because being good at math meant

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:23.371
he bought me a computer, and some of you remember

00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.220
this computer, this was my first computer.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.073
Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause)

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:32.327
As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter)

00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:34.588
You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.

00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:36.145
It would say you're wrong most of the time.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:37.979
That was the computer we knew.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.620
That computer is a computer that I learned about

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.197
going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.443
I learned about the computer at all levels,

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:52.123
and after, I went to art school to get away from computers,

00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:54.361
and I began to think about the computer as more of

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.542
a spiritual space of thinking.

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:59.396
And I was influenced by performance art --

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:03.631
so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.669
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.348
I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc.,

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:14.135
and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.100
It's a room broken in two halves.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.200
I've turned the computer on,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.753
and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:24.599
built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.908
And the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter)

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.425
She finds the first sector on the disk, and

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:36.756
takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.312
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer

00:02:40.312 --> 00:02:43.756
to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc.,

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:48.537
and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter)

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.014
And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:53.013
where it's XY. (Laughter)

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:54.722
It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:57.918
a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow

00:02:57.918 --> 00:03:02.041
this computer was compared to how fast a computer is,

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:06.678
it made me wonder about computers and technology in general.

00:03:06.678 --> 00:03:08.803
And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.

00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:12.495
The first three things are about how I've been curious

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:16.029
about technology, design and art, and how they intersect,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.986
how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on

00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:21.247
since four years ago I became the President

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:24.820
of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.537
And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:32.172
these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.

00:03:32.172 --> 00:03:34.807
So starting from technology,

00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:37.142
technology is a wonderful thing.

00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:40.666
When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:43.136
It could show text and

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:46.734
after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.216
Remember when images were first possible with a computer,

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.612
those gorgeous, full-color images?

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:54.830
And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.182
It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.

00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:01.119
And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.262
Remember that excitement?

00:04:03.262 --> 00:04:06.959
And then the browser appeared. The browser was great,

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.816
but the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.073
Text first, then images, we waited,

00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:14.869
CD-quality sound over the Net,

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:19.513
then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.

00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:22.383
And then the mobile phone occurred,

00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:27.918
text, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone,

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:32.042
iPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.069
You see this little pattern here?

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.402
We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.008
of possibility from computing is something I've been

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:42.825
questioning for the last 10 or so years,

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:47.039
and have looked to design, as we understand most things,

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.927
and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:55.683
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.

00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:58.181
Designers talk about the relationship between form

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.522
and content, content and form. Now what does that mean?

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:04.089
Well, content is the word up there: fear.

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:09.160
It's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.817
Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful,

00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:16.518
and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica,

00:05:16.518 --> 00:05:20.456
it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right? (Laughter)

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:23.054
You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big,

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:25.596
and like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:27.511
So you can see how you change the scale, you change

00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:31.819
the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.886
You change the typeface to, like, this typeface,

00:05:33.886 --> 00:05:36.669
and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.593
like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:42.484
Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:46.353
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter)

00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:48.773
Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)

00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:51.786
It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:54.238
It just changes the same content.

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:56.492
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart,

00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:58.680
they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.679
and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.864
You feel for them.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.998
Or you change the typeface to something like this.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:09.530
It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.816
I can never get in there. (Laughter)

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:17.102
It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.

00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:20.151
If you just change one letter in that content,

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:24.131
you get a much better word, much better content: free.

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:28.499
"Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way.

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.094
Free bold feels like Mandela free.

00:06:31.094 --> 00:06:33.775
It's like, yes, I can be free.

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:37.047
Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.

00:06:37.047 --> 00:06:39.777
It feels great. Or even free spread out,

00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:43.349
it's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.556
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.907
and I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter)

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.269
So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:54.702
It's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost,

00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:58.988
like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.

00:06:58.988 --> 00:07:01.275
Design does that.

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:04.423
And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect,

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:05.892
and I'm going to show you some old work I never really

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:09.180
show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.806
So -- yeah.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.997
So I made a lot of work in the '90s.

00:07:14.997 --> 00:07:18.293
This was a square that responds to sound.

00:07:18.293 --> 00:07:21.719
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:27.435
But I thought it'd be neat for the square

00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:32.491
to respond to me, and my kids were small then,

00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:35.067
and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah,"

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:37.993
you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that.

00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:40.378
We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.

00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:43.550
And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.093
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:50.312
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:53.496
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:56.465
interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because

00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:59.177
my students at MIT got so much better than myself,

00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:00.987
so I had to hang up my mouse.

00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:04.555
But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,

00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:07.782
monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.

00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.448
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."

00:08:09.448 --> 00:08:12.934
It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:17.019
that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:19.540
It has 10 variations. (Typing noise)

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.669
(Typing noise)

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:25.042
There's a shift.

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:29.307
Ten variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.

00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:32.911
(Typing noises)

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:39.896
This is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises)

00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:42.807
This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a --

00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:44.621
Let's see, this is —

00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:46.737
I love the French film "The Red Balloon."

00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:48.995
Great movie, right? I love that movie. So,

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.603
this is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)

00:08:52.603 --> 00:08:56.733
It's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)

00:08:56.733 --> 00:09:00.900
I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.851
It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.212
type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.282
(Laughter)

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.830
If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.187
"Hit G, and it's going to be all right.

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.698
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:16.698 --> 00:09:19.345
Thank you.

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:22.677
So that was 20 years ago, and

00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:27.319
I was always on the periphery of art.

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.669
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:33.328
and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.

00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:36.132
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.

00:09:36.132 --> 00:09:40.520
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.596
It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say,

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:45.560
like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great. (Laughter)

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.192
Art does that, because art is about asking questions,

00:09:48.192 --> 00:09:50.904
questions that may not be answerable.

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:52.832
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called

00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:56.502
the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples

00:09:56.502 --> 00:10:00.083
of animal, bone, mineral, plants.

00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:02.793
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,

00:10:02.793 --> 00:10:05.967
they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.

00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:08.508
And why do we have this facility?

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:11.951
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,

00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:14.831
the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.

00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:17.543
At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.

00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:19.208
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:23.336
digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:26.278
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:29.943
used to be done. There's something very different about it,

00:10:29.943 --> 00:10:32.269
something we should figure out what is good about

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:35.346
how we did it, even in this new era.

00:10:35.346 --> 00:10:38.237
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:41.775
Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo,

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:43.877
but when he was based in London, he had a game

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:47.168
with his wife. He would go to antique shops,

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.315
and the game was as such:

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.996
When we look at an antique we want,

00:10:51.996 --> 00:10:54.843
we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique,

00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:56.473
and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.

00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:58.714
So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup,

00:10:58.714 --> 00:11:00.043
and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."

00:11:00.043 --> 00:11:04.147
And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old." (Laughter)

00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:07.871
"Tell us more."
"Oh, it's really old." (Laughter)

00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:10.417
And he saw, over and over, the antique's value

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:13.080
was all about it being old.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.589
And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said,

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:18.233
you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:22.935
People say, "Wow, your art, what is it?"
It's new media.

00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:25.973
And he realized, it isn't about old or new.

00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:27.487
It's about something in between.

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:32.948
It isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good.

00:11:32.948 --> 00:11:38.382
A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.

00:11:38.382 --> 00:11:40.366
You see it in all interesting art today, in all

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.385
interesting businesses today. How we combine

00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:46.674
those two together to make good is very interesting.

00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:49.445
So art makes questions, and

00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:54.268
leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.

00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:56.270
We aren't functioning so easily anymore.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.398
We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.

00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:02.804
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time

00:12:02.804 --> 00:12:04.980
traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument,

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.142
and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass,"

00:12:08.142 --> 00:12:09.785
and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English,

00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:12.522
and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.

00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:15.396
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people,

00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:18.569
and it was the best sign ever to say no.

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:21.293
It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."

00:12:21.293 --> 00:12:26.892
My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:29.165
And also "no love." (Laughter)

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.718
So that is authoritarianism.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.883
And what is that, structurally?

00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:37.633
It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run

00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:40.658
many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:44.176
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.

00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:47.396
It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.

00:12:47.396 --> 00:12:50.796
And so today, leaders are faced

00:12:50.796 --> 00:12:52.710
with how to lead differently, I believe.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.940
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.180
on creative leadership. What can we learn

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.605
from artists and designers for how to lead?

00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:03.610
Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.683
Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.

00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:10.861
A traditional leader is always wanting to be right,

00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:15.322
whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:17.820
And this frame is important today, in this complex,

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.590
ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.300
And I had a show in London recently where my friends

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.177
invited me to come to London for four days

00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:30.639
to sit in a sandbox, and I said great.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:33.987
And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight,

00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:37.148
six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London,

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:39.335
and that was really bad.

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:42.967
But I would listen to people, hear their issues,

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.861
draw in the sand, try to figure things out,

00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:47.404
and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.

00:13:47.404 --> 00:13:50.112
You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.

00:13:50.112 --> 00:13:52.018
And it felt kind of like being president, actually.

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:55.015
I was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"

00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:56.923
And by the end of the experience,

00:13:56.923 --> 00:13:59.762
I realized why I was doing this.

00:13:59.762 --> 00:14:03.891
It's because leaders, what we do is we connect

00:14:03.891 --> 00:14:08.048
improbable connections and hope something will happen,

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:09.803
and in that room I found so many connections

00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:14.123
between people across all of London, and so leadership,

00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:16.760
connecting people, is the great question today.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.017
Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:21.412
it's a wonderful design challenge.

00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:25.137
And one thing I've been doing is doing some research

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:28.785
on systems that can combine technology and leadership

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:29.779
with an art and design perspective.

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:34.052
Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:36.494
So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch

00:14:36.494 --> 00:14:39.052
I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?

00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:43.311
This is called Powershop, and the way it works is

00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:46.338
imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever

00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:48.620
at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.839
There may be different subdivisions in the organization,

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:53.524
and you might want to look into different areas. For instance,

00:14:53.524 --> 00:14:57.026
green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:59.276
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:02.280
make things happen? So for instance, you might open up

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.430
a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there,

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.141
and know that you know someone in Eco, over here,

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.122
and

00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:13.130
these people here are in Eco, the people you might

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.198
engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:20.283
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find

00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:23.742
connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D,

00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:26.942
and here you see one person who crosses the two areas

00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:30.499
of interest, and it's a person important to engage.

00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:34.535
So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:37.134
on how you're interacting with them.

00:15:37.134 --> 00:15:38.713
How many coffees do you have?

00:15:38.713 --> 00:15:42.107
How often are you calling them, emailing them?

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.897
What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?

00:15:44.897 --> 00:15:47.259
Leaders might be able to use these systems to

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:50.241
better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.668
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:56.193
the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep

00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:59.422
text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?

00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:02.875
So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:05.733
They're targeted social media systems around leaders.

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:09.042
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin

00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:14.349
to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.774
because art and design lets you think like this,

00:16:17.774 --> 00:16:19.549
find different systems like this,

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:21.422
and I've just begun thinking like this,

00:16:21.422 --> 00:16:23.355
so I'm glad to share that with you.

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:26.537
So in closing, I want to thank all of you

00:16:26.537 --> 00:16:30.619
for your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause)

00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:35.303
(Applause)
