00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
So for the past year and a half,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
my team at Push Pop Press

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
have been working on creating

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
the first feature-length interactive book.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
It's called "Our Choice"

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
and the author is Al Gore.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
and it explores all the solutions

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
that will solve the climate crisis.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
The book starts like this. This is the cover.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
As the globe spins,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
we can see our location,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and we can open the book

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
and swipe through the chapters

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
to browse the book.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
And if we wanted to zoom into a page,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
we can just open it up.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260
And anything you see in the book,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
you can pick up with two fingers

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
and lift off the page

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and open up.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
And if you want to go back

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
and read the book again,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
among the majority

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
who look at windmills and feel

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
And throughout the book,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
there's over an hour of documentary footage

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
and interactive animations.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
So you can open this one.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
MM: It starts playing immediately.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and the movie keeps playing.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
and the video keeps playing.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
But one of the coolest things in this book

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
are the interactive infographics.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
This one shows the wind potential

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
all around the United States.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
But instead of just showing us the information,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
we can take our finger and explore,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and see, state by state,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
exactly how much wind potential there is.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
We can do the same for geothermal energy

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
and solar power.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
This is one of my favorites.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
So this shows ...

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260
(Laughter)

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
(Applause)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
When the wind is blowing,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
any excess energy coming from the windmill

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
is diverted into the battery.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
And as the wind starts dying down,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
the lights never go out.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
It also runs on the iPhone.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
And it works the exact same way.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
You can pinch into any page.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
Open it up.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Al Gore's "Our Choice."

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
Thank you.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.260
(Applause)

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Do you want to be a publisher,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
a technology licenser?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
What is the business here?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
Is this something that other people can do?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and we're on the West coast, building the software --

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
takes our tool

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
and, every day, drags in images and text.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.)

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
All right. Mike, thanks so much.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.)

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
(Applause)
