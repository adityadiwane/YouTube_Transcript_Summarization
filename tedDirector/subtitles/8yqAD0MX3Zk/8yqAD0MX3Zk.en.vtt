00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:22.758
Hi. My name is Marwa,
and I'm an architect.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:24.993
I was born and raised in Homs,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:27.735
a city in the central
western part of Syria,

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.088
and I've always lived here.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.477
After six years of war,

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.429
Homs is now a half-destroyed city.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.128
My family and I were lucky;
our place is still standing.

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:40.335
Although for two years,
we were like prisoners at home.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.048
Outside there were demonstrations
and battles and bombings and snipers.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.132
My husband and I used to run
an architecture studio

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:50.798
in the old town main square.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.092
It's gone, as is most
of the old town itself.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:56.566
Half of the city's other neighborhoods

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.747
are now rubble.

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.646
Since the ceasefire in late 2015,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.585
large parts of Homs
have been more or less quiet.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.302
The economy is completely broken,
and people are still fighting.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:09.803
The merchants who had stalls
in the old city market

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:12.272
now trade out of sheds on the streets.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:14.792
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:19.362
sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house,
workshops, among many more.

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:22.375
I have started teaching part-time,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.913
and with my husband,
who juggles several jobs,

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:26.573
we've opened a small bookshop.

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:29.763
Other people do all sorts
of jobs to get by.

00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:34.057
When I look at my destroyed city,
of course, I ask myself:

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.008
What has led to this senseless war?

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:39.009
Syria was largely a place of tolerance,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.073
historically accustomed to variety,

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:44.378
accommodating a wide range
of beliefs, origins, customs,

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:45.585
goods, food.

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:47.480
How did my country --

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:50.202
a country with communities
living harmoniously together

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.717
and comfortable in discussing
their differences --

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:56.826
how did it degenerate into civil war,
violence, displacement

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.755
and unprecedented sectarian hatred?

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.047
There were many reasons
that had led to the war --

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.156
social, political and economic.

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:07.307
They all have played their role.

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:11.203
But I believe there is one key reason
that has been overlooked

00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:13.137
and which is important to analyze,

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.487
because from it will largely depend

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:18.438
whether we can make sure
that this doesn't happen again.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.364
And that reason is architecture.

00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.399
Architecture in my country
has played an important role

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:28.443
in creating, directing and amplifying
conflict between warring factions,

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.343
and this is probably true
for other countries as well.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.282
There is a sure correspondence
between the architecture of a place

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:38.243
and the character of the community
that has settled there.

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.426
Architecture plays a key role
in whether a community crumbles

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.689
or comes together.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.565
Syrian society has long lived
the coexistence

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.945
of different traditions and backgrounds.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.699
Syrians have experienced
the prosperity of open trade

00:02:51.723 --> 00:02:53.475
and sustainable communities.

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.570
They have enjoyed the true meaning
of belonging to a place,

00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:59.297
and that was reflected
in their built environment,

00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.789
in the mosques and churches
built back-to-back,

00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:04.060
in the interwoven souks and public venues,

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:08.297
and the proportions and sizes based
on principles of humanity and harmony.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:12.360
This architecture of mixity
can still be read in the remains.

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:16.122
The old Islamic city in Syria
was built over a multilayered past,

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:18.578
integrating with it
and embracing its spirit.

00:03:18.602 --> 00:03:20.229
So did its communities.

00:03:20.253 --> 00:03:22.181
People lived and worked with each other

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.411
in a place that gave them
a sense of belonging

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.440
and made them feel at home.

00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:28.764
They shared a remarkably
unified existence.

00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:31.213
But over the last century,

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:35.738
gradually this delicate balance
of these places has been interfered with;

00:03:35.762 --> 00:03:38.442
first, by the urban planners
of the colonial period,

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:40.680
when the French went
enthusiastically about,

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:43.962
transforming what they saw
as the un-modern Syrian cities.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.963
They blew up city streets
and relocated monuments.

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:50.231
They called them improvements,

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:53.631
and they were the beginning
of a long, slow unraveling.

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:56.545
The traditional urbanism
and architecture of our cities

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.735
assured identity and belonging
not by separation,

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.513
but by intertwining.

00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:05.274
But over time, the ancient became
worthless, and the new, coveted.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.633
The harmony of the built environment
and social environment

00:04:08.657 --> 00:04:11.320
got trampled over
by elements of modernity --

00:04:11.344 --> 00:04:13.526
brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.249
neglect, aesthetic devastation,

00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:21.414
divisive urbanism that zoned
communities by class, creed or affluence.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.328
And the same was happening
to the community.

00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:26.947
As the shape of the built
environment changed,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.279
so the lifestyles and sense
of belonging of the communities

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.014
also started changing.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:34.655
From a register
of togetherness, of belonging,

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.250
architecture became
a way of differentiation,

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:39.671
and communities started drifting apart

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:42.666
from the very fabric
that used to unite them,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.417
and from the soul of the place that used
to represent their common existence.

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:49.830
While many reasons had led
to the Syrian war,

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:51.973
we shouldn't underestimate
the way in which,

00:04:51.997 --> 00:04:55.846
by contributing to the loss 
of identity and self-respect,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.247
urban zoning and misguided,
inhumane architecture

00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:01.980
have nurtured sectarian
divisions and hatred.

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:05.805
Over time, the united city
has morphed into a city center

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:08.346
with ghettos along its circumference.

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:12.847
And in turn, the coherent communities
became distinct social groups,

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.147
alienated from each other
and alienated from the place.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.491
From my point of view,

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.632
losing the sense of belonging to a place

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:22.828
and a sense of sharing it
with someone else

00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:25.172
has made it a lot easier to destroy.

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:28.880
The clear example can be seen
in the informal housing system,

00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:33.400
which used to host, before the war,
over 40 percent of the population.

00:05:33.424 --> 00:05:37.234
Yes, prior to the war,
almost half of the Syrian population

00:05:37.258 --> 00:05:38.693
lived in slums,

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:41.819
peripheral areas
without proper infrastructure,

00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:44.716
made of endless rows of bare block boxes

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.168
containing people,

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.327
people who mostly belonged
to the same group,

00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:52.541
whether based on religion,
class, origin or all of the above.

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:58.406
This ghettoized urbanism
proved to be a tangible precursor of war.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.784
Conflict is much easier
between pre-categorized areas --

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:03.101
where the "others" live.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.283
The ties that used
to bind the city together --

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:08.967
whether they were social,
through coherent building,

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.124
or economic, through trade in the souk,

00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:14.034
or religious, through
the coexistent presence --

00:06:14.058 --> 00:06:17.770
were all lost in the misguided
and visionless modernization

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.158
of the built environment.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.047
Allow me an aside.

00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:25.650
When I read about heterogeneous urbanism
in other parts of the world,

00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:28.146
involving ethnic neighborhoods
in British cities

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.279
or around Paris or Brussels,

00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:33.897
I recognize the beginning
of the kind of instability

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.851
we have witnessed
so disastrously here in Syria.

00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:40.233
We have severely destroyed cities,

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:43.438
such as Homs, Aleppo,
Daraa and many others,

00:06:43.462 --> 00:06:47.321
and almost half of the population
of the country is now displaced.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:49.493
Hopefully, the war will end,

00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:53.011
and the question that,
as an architect, I have to ask, is:

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:54.793
How do we rebuild?

00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:57.953
What are the principles
that we should adopt

00:06:57.977 --> 00:07:00.735
in order to avoid repeating
the same mistakes?

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.638
From my point of view, the main focus
should be on creating places

00:07:04.662 --> 00:07:06.830
that make their people feel they belong.

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.349
Architecture and planning
need to recapture

00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:12.277
some of the traditional values
that did just that,

00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:15.532
creating the conditions
for coexistence and peace,

00:07:15.556 --> 00:07:18.824
values of beauty
that don't exhibit ostentation,

00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:21.213
but rather, approachability and ease,

00:07:21.237 --> 00:07:24.744
moral values that promote
generosity and acceptance,

00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:28.745
architecture that is for everyone
to enjoy, not just for the elite,

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:32.421
just as used to be in the shadowed alleys
of the old Islamic city,

00:07:32.445 --> 00:07:35.278
mixed designs that encourage
a sense of community.

00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:39.565
There is a neighborhood here in Homs
that's called Baba Amr

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:41.252
that has been fully destroyed.

00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:44.240
Almost two years ago,
I introduced this design

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.261
into a UN-Habitat competition
for rebuilding it.

00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:51.623
The idea was to create an urban fabric
inspired by a tree,

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:54.568
capable of growing
and spreading organically,

00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:57.814
echoing the traditional bridge
hanging over the old alleys,

00:07:57.838 --> 00:08:01.590
and incorporating apartments,
private courtyards, shops,

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.987
workshops, places for parking
and playing and leisure,

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:06.594
trees and shaded areas.

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:09.611
It's far from perfect, obviously.

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:12.906
I drew it during the few hours
of electricity we get.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.528
And there are many possible ways
to express belonging and community

00:08:16.552 --> 00:08:17.703
through architecture.

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:20.771
But compare it with the freestanding,
disconnected blocks

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:24.750
proposed by the official project
for rebuilding Baba Amr.

00:08:24.774 --> 00:08:28.382
Architecture is not the axis
around which all human life rotates,

00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:32.778
but it has the power to suggest
and even direct human activity.

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:37.383
In that sense, settlement,
identity and social integration

00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:41.328
are all the producer and product
of effective urbanism.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.946
The coherent urbanism
of the old Islamic city

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.866
and of many old European
towns, for instance,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.623
promote integration,

00:08:49.647 --> 00:08:52.884
while rows of soulless housing
or tower blocks,

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.673
even when they are luxurious,

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:57.362
tend to promote isolation and "otherness."

00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.208
Even simple things

00:08:59.232 --> 00:09:03.088
like shaded places or fruit plants
or drinking water inside the city

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:06.287
can make a difference
in how people feel towards the place,

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:09.500
and whether they consider it
a generous place that gives,

00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:12.696
a place that's worth keeping,
contributing to,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.077
or whether they see it
as an alienating place,

00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:16.576
full of seeds of anger.

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:21.307
In order for a place to give,
its architecture should be giving, too.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.104
Our built environment matters.

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:28.112
The fabric of our cities is reflected
in the fabric of our souls.

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:31.753
And whether in the shape
of informal concrete slums

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:33.403
or broken social housing

00:09:33.427 --> 00:09:35.186
or trampled old towns

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.956
or forests of skyscrapers,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.083
the contemporary urban archetypes

00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:41.815
that have emerged
all across the Middle East

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:46.138
have been one cause of the alienation
and fragmentation of our communities.

00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:48.464
We can learn from this.

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:51.341
We can learn how to rebuild
in another way,

00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:54.682
how to create an architecture
that doesn't contribute only

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:57.663
to the practical and economic
aspects of people's lives,

00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:01.606
but also to their social, spiritual
and psychological needs.

00:10:02.043 --> 00:10:05.948
Those needs were totally overlooked
in the Syrian cities before the war.

00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:09.318
We need to create again
cities that are shared

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.373
by the communities that inhabit them.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.666
If we do so, people will not feel the need

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.539
to seek identities opposed
to the other identities all around,

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:21.658
because they will all feel at home.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.634
Thank you for listening.
