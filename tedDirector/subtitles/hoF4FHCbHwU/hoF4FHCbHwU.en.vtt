00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
In Africa we say,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
"God gave the white man a watch

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and gave the black man time."

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
(Laughter)

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I think, how is it possible

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
for a man with so much time

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
to tell his story in 18 minutes?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Most African stories these days,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
they talk about famine,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
HIV and AIDS,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
poverty or war.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
But my story that I would like to share with you today

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
is the one about success.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
It is about a country

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in the southwest of Africa

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
called Namibia.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Namibia has got 2.1 million people,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but it is only twice the size of California.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
I come from a region

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
in the remote northwest part of the country.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
It's called Kunene region.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And in the center of Kunene region

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
This is where I'm coming from.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Most people that are following the story

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
of Angelina Jolie

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
and Brad Pitt

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
will know where Namibia is.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
They love Namibia

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
for its beautiful dunes,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
that are even taller

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
than the Empire State Building.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Wind and time have twisted our landscape

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
into very strange shapes,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
and these shapes are speckled with wildlife

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
that has become so adapted

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to this harsh and strange land.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I'm a Himba.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
I'm a Himba and Namibian.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
A Himba is one of the 29

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260
ethnic groups in Namibia.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
We live a very traditional lifestyle.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
I grew up herding,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
looking after our livestock --

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
goats, sheep and cattle.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And one day,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
my father actually took me into the bush.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
He said, "John,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I want you to become a good herder.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and you see a cheetah

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
eating our goat --

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
cheetah is very nervous --

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
just walk up to it.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
(Laughter)

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
"And he will let go of the goat

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and run off."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
But then he said,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
"Boy, if you run into a lion,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
don't move.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
Don't move. Stand your ground.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Puff up and just look it in the eye

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
and it may not want to fight you."

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.260
(Laughter)

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
But then, he said,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
"If you see a leopard,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
boy, you better run like hell."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
(Laughter)

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
In this way --

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
(Laughter)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
In this way, I actually started to learn about nature.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
In addition to being an ordinary Namibian

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
and in addition to being a Himba

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
I'm also a trained conservationist.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
And it is very important if you are in the field

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
to know what to confront

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
and what to run from.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
I was born in 1971.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
We lived under apartheid regime.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
The whites could farm, graze

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and hunt as they wished,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
but we black, we were not regarded as responsible

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
to use wildlife.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
Whenever we tried to hunt,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
we were called poachers.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
Between 1966 and 1990,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
the U.S. and Soviet interests

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
fought for control over my country.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And you know, during war time,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.260
there are militaries, armies, that are moving around.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
and tusks.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
They could sell these things for anything between

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260
$5,000 a kilo.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
During the same year

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.260
almost every Himba had a rifle.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Because it was wartime,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
the British .303 rifle

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
was just all over the whole country.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
Then in the same time, around 1980,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
we had a very big drought.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260
It killed almost everything that was left.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Our livestock was

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
almost at the brink of extinction,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
protected as well.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
We were hungry.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
I remember a night

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
when a hungry leopard

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
went into the house

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
of one of our neighbors

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
and took a sleeping child out of the bed.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.260
It's a very sad story.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
But even today,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
that memory is still in people's minds.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
They can pinpoint the exact location

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
where this all happened.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
And then, in the same year,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
we almost lost everything.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
And the year I went to school,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.260
called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.260
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
They were trusted by the local communities

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
wildlife disappearing,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
poaching was skyrocketing,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and the situation seemed very hopeless.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Death and despair surrounded Joshua

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
and our entire communities.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.260
But then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.260
What if we pay people that you trust

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
to look after wildlife?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
that know the bush very well

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
and that know wildlife very well?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.260
The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
"Eh? The poachers?"

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
"Yes. Our poachers."

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
And that was my father.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.260
My father has been a poacher for quite a long time.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
Instead of shooting poachers dead

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
like they were doing elsewhere in Africa,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.260
IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
to manage their peoples

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and their rights to own and manage wildlife.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.260
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
wildlife numbers started coming back,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
was embraced by our new government.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation:

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
The very first one is

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.260
honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Here is our tradition:

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
speak through the headman

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
and advise us where to get water,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
where to get grazings,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.260
and where to go and hunt.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
on the environment.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
And here are the new ideas.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
Transporting rhinos using helicopters

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
I think is much easier

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And these things we were taught by outsiders.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
We learned these things from outsiders.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.260
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.260
we needed to learn more things like GPS

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
just to see whether --

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.260
And we then wanted to see whether we can match our

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.260
ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
And through this,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
we actually started realizing our dreams,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
and we maintained honoring our traditions

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
but we were still open to new ideas.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.260
The second element is that we wanted to have a life,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.260
a better life where we can benefit through many things.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Most poachers, like my father,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
were people from our own community.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
They were not people from outside.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
These were our own people.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
And sometimes, once they were caught,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.260
they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
and they were made part of the bigger dreams.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.260
The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father --

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
(Laughter)

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And when this thing started going on,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
we started becoming one community,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
renewing our connection to nature.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
The last element that actually helped develop these things

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
was the partnerships.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
The other partners that we have got

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
is business communities.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.260
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
and they have also helped make wildlife

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.260
a very valuable land use like any other land uses

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
such as agriculture.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And most of my conservation colleagues today

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
that you find in Namibia

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
have been trained through the initiative,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.260
through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
in the most up-to-date conservation practices.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
They have also given funding for two decades

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
to this whole program.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
we've been able to scale up the very small programs

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
to national programs today.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
Namibia ... or Sesfontein

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
was no more an isolated village somewhere,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.260
hidden away in Namibia.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260
With these assets we are now part of the global village.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Thirty years have passed

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.260
since my father's first job as a community game guard.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.260
It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
as I and my children see it today.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
When I finished school in 1995,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.260
there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.260
But today, there are more than 130 lions.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:28.260
(Applause)

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
So please, if you go to Namibia,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
make sure that you stay in the tents.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
Don't walk out at night!

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.260
(Laughter)

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.260
The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260
But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino --

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.260
This is outside the protected area.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
(Applause)

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.260
The leopard -- they are now in big numbers

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.260
but they are now far away from our village,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
because the natural plain has multiplied,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
like zebras, springboks and everything.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
They stay very much far away

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
because this other thing has multiplied

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.260
from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.260
What started as very small,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
community rangers getting community involved,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260
has now grown into something that we call conservancies.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Conservancies are legally instituted institutions

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
by the government,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Today, we have got 60 conservancies

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.260
that manage and protect over 13 million hectares

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.260
of land in Namibia.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.260
We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
Nowhere else in the world

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.260
has community-adopted conservation at this scale.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.260
(Applause)

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.260
In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.260
This is our new economy --

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
And we are able to use this money for many things:

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
Very importantly, we put it in education.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.260
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And this is the good news from Africa

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
that we have to shout from the rooftops.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:45.260
(Applause)

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.260
And now, what the world really needs

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:56.260
is for you to help me and our partners

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.260
take some of what we have learned in Namibia

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.260
to other places with similar problems:

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
places like Mongolia,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.260
or even in your own backyards,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
the Northern Great Plains,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
where buffalo and other animals have suffered

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
and many communities are in decline.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
I like that one:

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.260
Namibia serving as a model to Africa,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.260
and Africa serving as a model to the United States.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:41.260
(Applause)

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
We were successful in Namibia

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
because we dreamed of a future

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.260
that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.260
We knew conservation would fail

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:02.260
if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.260
So, come and talk to me about Namibia,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and better yet, come to Namibia

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
and see for yourself how we have done it.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
And please, do visit our website

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
in Africa and across the world.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:39.260
(Applause)
