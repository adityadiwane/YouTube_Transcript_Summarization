00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
First of all, I'm a geek.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
I'm an organic food-eating,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And I really want to build green,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
but I'm very suspicious

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
of all of these well-meaning articles,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
people long on moral authority

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
and short on data,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
telling me how to do these kinds of things.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
And so I have to figure this out for myself.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
For example: Is this evil?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
from happy self-actualized local cows

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
on my counter top,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
This is the amount of energy that goes into

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
any paper towel or embodied water,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
and every time I use a paper towel,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
I am using this much

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
virtual energy and water.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Wipe it up, throw it away.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
that I can use a thousand times,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
until I wash that yogurty towel.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
This is now operating energy.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I've now put energy and water

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
back into that towel ...

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and then it looks a little bit better.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
But what about a recycled paper towel

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
that comes in those little half sheets?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
Well, now a paper towel looks better.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
in the position of hot even when you turn it on,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
and then you start to use more energy.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Or worse, you let it run until it's warm

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
to rinse out your towel.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
And now all bets are off.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
(Laughter)

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
So what this says is that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
sometimes the things that you least expect --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
the position in which you put the handle --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
have a bigger effect than any of those other things

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
that you were trying to optimize.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
Now imagine someone as twisted as me

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
trying to build a house.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
(Laughter)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
And there's a thousand and one articles out there

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
And they are just as suspect

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.260
in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
and missing the elephant in the living room.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
Now, the average house

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
has about 300 megawatt hours

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
of embodied energy in it;

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
this is the energy it takes to make it --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
millions and millions of paper towels.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
We wanted to know how much better we could do.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
And so, like many people,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
we start with a house on a lot,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
and what we're doing on the bottom.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
So first, we demolish it.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
you take it all apart, you use the bits --

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
you can get some of that energy back.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
We then dug a big hole

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
to put in a rainwater catchment tank

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
to take our yard water independent.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
And then we poured a big foundation

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
for passive solar.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Now, you can reduce the embodied energy

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
by about 25 percent

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
by using high fly ash concrete.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
We then put in framing.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
And so this is framing -- lumber,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
composite materials --

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.260
and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
but it can be a sustainable resource

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
if you use FSC-certified lumber.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
We then go on to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
the first thing that was very surprising.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
If we put aluminum windows in this house,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.260
we would double the energy use right there.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Now, PVC is a little bit better,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
but still not as good as the wood that we chose.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
We then put in plumbing,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
electrical and HVAC,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
and insulate.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
but it is pretty high embodied energy,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
is a much lower energy alternative to that.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
We also used straw bale

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
infill for our library,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
which has zero embodied energy.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
When it comes time to sheetrock,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
And then you get to the finishes,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
the subject of all of those "go green" articles,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.260
and on the scale of a house

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
they almost make no difference at all.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And yet, all the press is focused on that.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Except for flooring.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
If you put carpeting in your house,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
unless you use concrete or wood

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
for a much lower embodied energy.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
and we've built a house for less than half

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
But before we pat ourselves

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
too much on the back,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
we have poured 151 megawatt hours

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
of energy into constructing this house

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
when there was a house there before.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
And so the question is:

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
How could we make that back?

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
we make it back in about six years.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
to be more energy-efficient,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
and in that case,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
it would take me more about 20 years to break even.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
it would have taken us

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
over 50 years to break even

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
compared to the upgraded house.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
So what does this mean?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.260
On the scale of my portion of the house,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260
this is equivalent to about

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
as much as I drive in a year,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
it's about five times as much

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
as if I went entirely vegetarian.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
But my elephant in the living room flies.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.260
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
But all the calculations

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
for embodied energy are on the blog.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
to be the biggest changes that are.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Thank you. (Applause)
