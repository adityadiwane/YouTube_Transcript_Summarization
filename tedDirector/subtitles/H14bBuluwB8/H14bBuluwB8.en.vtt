00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.930
When I was 27 years old,

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:18.277
I left a very demanding job
in management consulting

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:22.058
for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching.

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:25.778
I went to teach seventh graders math

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.702
in the New York City public schools.

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:31.083
And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests.

00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:33.083
I gave out homework assignments.

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.829
When the work came back,
I calculated grades.

00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:41.310
What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:44.470
between my best and my worst students.

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:49.784
Some of my strongest performers
did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:53.583
Some of my smartest kids
weren't doing so well.

00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:55.694
And that got me thinking.

00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:59.392
The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math,

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:04.318
sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,
the area of a parallelogram.

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.344
But these concepts are not impossible,

00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:11.478
and I was firmly convinced
that every one of my students

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:14.082
could learn the material

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.169
if they worked hard and long enough.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.304
After several more years of teaching,

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:23.062
I came to the conclusion
that what we need in education

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:26.546
is a much better understanding
of students and learning

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.887
from a motivational perspective,

00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:31.117
from a psychological perspective.

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:37.308
In education, the one thing
we know how to measure best is IQ.

00:01:38.172 --> 00:01:42.024
But what if doing
well in school and in life

00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:44.142
depends on much more

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.546
than your ability to learn
quickly and easily?

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:50.297
So I left the classroom,

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.312
and I went to graduate school
to become a psychologist.

00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:56.027
I started studying kids and adults

00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:58.884
in all kinds of super
challenging settings,

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:01.336
and in every study my question was,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.606
who is successful here and why?

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:07.977
My research team and I went
to West Point Military Academy.

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:10.136
We tried to predict which cadets

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.668
would stay in military training
and which would drop out.

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:16.645
We went to the National Spelling Bee

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:21.208
and tried to predict which children
would advance farthest in competition.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:25.923
We studied rookie teachers
working in really tough neighborhoods,

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:29.364
asking which teachers are still
going to be here in teaching

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:31.382
by the end of the school year,

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:34.417
and of those, who will be
the most effective

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.125
at improving learning
outcomes for their students?

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:39.822
We partnered with private
companies, asking,

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:42.541
which of these salespeople
is going to keep their jobs?

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:44.431
And who's going to earn the most money?

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.455
In all those very different contexts,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.980
one characteristic emerged
as a significant predictor of success.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.242
And it wasn't social intelligence.

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:57.647
It wasn't good looks, physical health,

00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:58.989
and it wasn't IQ.

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:00.874
It was grit.

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:06.529
Grit is passion and perseverance
for very long-term goals.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.660
Grit is having stamina.

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:13.438
Grit is sticking with your future,
day in, day out,

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:16.827
not just for the week,
not just for the month,

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:18.383
but for years,

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:22.128
and working really hard
to make that future a reality.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.238
Grit is living life
like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:29.587
A few years ago,

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:32.625
I started studying grit
in the Chicago public schools.

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.429
I asked thousands of high school juniors

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:37.281
to take grit questionnaires,

00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:39.257
and then waited around more than a year

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.637
to see who would graduate.

00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:43.740
Turns out that grittier kids

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:46.944
were significantly more
likely to graduate,

00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:50.730
even when I matched them
on every characteristic I could measure,

00:03:50.754 --> 00:03:53.004
things like family income,

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:55.750
standardized achievement test scores,

00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.798
even how safe kids felt
when they were at school.

00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:02.314
So it's not just at West Point
or the National Spelling Bee

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:03.452
that grit matters.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.417
It's also in school,

00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.822
especially for kids
at risk for dropping out.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:12.074
To me, the most shocking thing about grit

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:14.057
is how little we know,

00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.583
how little science knows,
about building it.

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.254
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:21.478
"How do I build grit in kids?

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:24.419
What do I do to teach kids
a solid work ethic?

00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:27.241
How do I keep them motivated
for the long run?"

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.835
The honest answer is,

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:30.936
I don't know.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.435
(Laughter)

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.498
What I do know is that talent
doesn't make you gritty.

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:37.853
Our data show very clearly

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:40.290
that there are many talented individuals

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:43.433
who simply do not follow through
on their commitments.

00:04:43.814 --> 00:04:48.028
In fact, in our data,
grit is usually unrelated

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:51.173
or even inversely related
to measures of talent.

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:56.560
So far, the best idea I've heard
about building grit in kids

00:04:56.584 --> 00:04:58.806
is something called "growth mindset."

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.119
This is an idea developed
at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,

00:05:03.143 --> 00:05:08.241
and it is the belief that the ability
to learn is not fixed,

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:10.732
that it can change with your effort.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.759
Dr. Dweck has shown

00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:15.918
that when kids read
and learn about the brain

00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:19.416
and how it changes and grows
in response to challenge,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.437
they're much more likely
to persevere when they fail,

00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:28.070
because they don't believe that failure
is a permanent condition.

00:05:29.052 --> 00:05:32.182
So growth mindset
is a great idea for building grit.

00:05:32.724 --> 00:05:34.261
But we need more.

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:36.921
And that's where I'm going
to end my remarks,

00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:38.291
because that's where we are.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:40.480
That's the work that stands before us.

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:44.384
We need to take our best ideas,
our strongest intuitions,

00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:46.043
and we need to test them.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.223
We need to measure
whether we've been successful,

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:52.953
and we have to be willing
to fail, to be wrong,

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.615
to start over again with lessons learned.

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:59.280
In other words, we need to be gritty

00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.773
about getting our kids grittier.

00:06:02.177 --> 00:06:03.209
Thank you.

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:06.068
(Applause)
