00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:15.319
So I was trained to become a gymnast

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.975
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.520
When I was in the first grade, the government

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.127
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:26.175
all expenses paid.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.823
But my tiger mother said, "No."

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:30.959
My parents wanted me to become

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.063
an engineer like them.

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:35.150
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.959
they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.892
a safe and well-paid job.

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:44.687
It is not important if I like the job or not.

00:00:44.687 --> 00:00:49.967
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:53.615
That is me playing my imaginary piano.

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.799
An opera singer must start training young

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.383
to learn acrobatics,

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:00.327
so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.594
I even wrote to the school principal

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.355
and the host of a radio show.

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:09.161
But no adults liked the idea.

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:11.884
No adults believed I was serious.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.128
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,

00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:17.884
just as powerless as I was.

00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:23.649
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.616
My dream would never come true.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:29.924
I was afraid that for the rest of my life

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.961
some second-class happiness

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.498
would be the best I could hope for.

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:36.926
But that's so unfair.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:40.728
So I was determined to find another calling.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:43.465
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:45.697
I turned to books.

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:49.339
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:54.216
from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:57.289
I found my role model of an independent woman

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.133
when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.830
And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.795
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.866
["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:14.057
I came to the U.S. in 1995,

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:16.938
so which books did I read here first?

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:20.463
Books banned in China, of course.

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:24.133
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:28.235
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:31.960
The Bible is interesting, but strange.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.445
(Laughter)

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.916
That's a topic for a different day.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:41.211
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.190
"You shall honor your father and mother."

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.140
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.879
and better, than obey."

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.383
So it becomes my tool to climb out

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:53.499
of this Confucian guilt trap

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.771
and to restart my relationship with my parents.

00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.793
Encountering a new culture also started my habit

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:02.565
of comparative reading.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.420
It offers many insights.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.200
For example, I found this map out of place at first

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.085
because this is what Chinese students grew up with.

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.586
It had never occurred to me,

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:18.721
China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:22.974
A map actually carries somebody's view.

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:25.382
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:28.686
It's a standard practice in the academic world.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:30.154
There are even research fields

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:34.099
such as comparative religion and comparative literature.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.334
Compare and contrast gives scholars

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:39.340
a more complete understanding of a topic.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.093
So I thought, well, if comparative reading

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:44.929
works for research, why not do it in daily life too?

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.304
So I started reading books in pairs.

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:49.518
So they can be about people --

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:50.401
["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.909
who are involved in the same event,

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.588
or friends with shared experiences.

00:03:55.588 --> 00:03:56.988
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]

00:03:56.988 --> 00:04:01.386
I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.498
[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:06.635
or similar stories from different cultures,

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.516
as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.909
For example, both the Christ and the Buddha

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.342
went through three temptations.

00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:17.144
For the Christ, the temptations

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:21.119
are economic, political and spiritual.

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.445
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:32.763
lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.

00:04:32.763 --> 00:04:35.802
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun

00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:37.699
to read your favorite books in two languages.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:38.951
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]

00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:42.511
Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:46.735
For example, it's through translation that I realized

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:52.708
"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:57.997
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.258
(Laughter)

00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:06.645
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.290
of the past and the present.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.525
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:16.202
Having a dream shattered really is nothing

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:19.138
compared to what many others have suffered.

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.866
I have come to believe that coming true

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:25.146
is not the only purpose of a dream.

00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:29.047
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:31.162
with where dreams come from,

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:34.066
where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:38.288
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.

00:05:38.288 --> 00:05:40.542
So because of books, I'm here today,

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:44.202
happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,

00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:45.952
most of the time.

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:49.513
So may books be always with you.

00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:50.991
Thank you.

00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:52.839
(Applause)

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.484
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:56.484 --> 00:06:01.577
Thank you. (Applause)
