00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:18.257
(Aquatic noises)

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:22.714
So this video was taken

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:25.146
at Aquarius undersea laboratory

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:26.999
four miles off the coast of Key Largo,

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.577
about 60 feet below the surface.

00:00:29.577 --> 00:00:31.301
NASA uses this extreme environment

00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:33.725
to train astronauts and aquanauts,

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:37.087
and last year, they invited us along for the ride.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:39.971
All the footage was taken from our open ROV,

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:44.458
which is a robot that we built in our garage.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:48.026
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:49.553
which in our case means our little robot

00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:51.817
sends live video

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.735
across that ultra-thin tether

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.163
back to the computer topside.

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.141
It's open source, meaning we publish

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.186
and share all of our design files

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.694
and all of our code online,

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.728
allowing anyone to modify

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:06.077
or improve or change the design.

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:08.380
It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.215
and costs about 1,000 times cheaper

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:12.094
than the ROVs James Cameron used

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:15.699
to explore the Titanic.

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:17.909
So ROVs aren't new.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.617
They've been around for decades.

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.653
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.

00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:25.472
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:27.019
and construction.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.781
What we've built isn't unique.

00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:32.655
It's how we've built it that's really unique.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.636
So I want to give you a quick story
of how it got started.

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.907
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:40.107
decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.965
in the foothills of the Sierras.

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:43.868
We had heard this story about lost gold

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:46.386
from a Gold Rush-era robbery,
and we wanted to go up there.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.044
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money

00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:49.867
and we didn't have any tools to do it.

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.067
So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:55.840
but we didn't have all the parts figured out,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.052
so we did what anybody would do in our situation:

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:00.090
we asked the Internet for help.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.622
More specifically, we created this website,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.517
openROV.com, and shared 
our intentions and our plans

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:07.907
For the first few months, it was just Eric and I

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:10.437
talking back to each other on the forums,

00:02:10.437 --> 00:02:12.525
but pretty soon, we started to get feedback

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:14.368
from makers and hobbyists,

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.362
and then actually professional ocean engineers

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:19.894
who had some suggestions for what we should do.

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:21.658
We kept working on it. We learned a lot.

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:23.683
We kept prototyping, and eventually,

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:26.402
we decided we wanted to go 
to the cave. We were ready.

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:29.842
So about that time, our little expedition
became quite a story,

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:31.863
and it got picked up in The New York Times.

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.675
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:35.458
with interest from people who wanted a kit

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.979
that they could build this open ROV themselves.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.268
So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:42.500
and when we did,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.575
we raised our funding goal in about two hours,

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:47.780
and all of a sudden, 
had this money to make these kits.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.975
But then we had to learn how to make them.

00:02:49.975 --> 00:02:52.140
I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.400
So we quickly learned that our garage

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.079
was not big enough to hold our growing operation.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.235
But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:02.942
thanks a lot to TechShop,
which was a big help to us,

00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:05.927
and we shipped these kits all over the world

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:07.756
just before Christmas of last year,

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:09.538
so it was just a few months ago.

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:11.446
But we're already starting to get video

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:13.044
and photos back from all over the world,

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:16.074
including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:19.474
We've also learned the penguins love robots.

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:21.487
(Laughter)

00:03:21.487 --> 00:03:24.655
So we're still publishing all the designs online,

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:26.773
encouraging anyone to build these themselves.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.176
That's the only way that we could have done this.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.835
By being open source, we've created

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.099
this distributed R&amp;D network,

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.895
and we're moving faster than
any venture-backed counterpart.

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:40.100
But the actual robot is really only half the story.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.596
The real potential, the long term potential,

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.273
is with this community of DIY ocean explorers

00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:47.669
that are forming all over the globe.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.203
What can we discover

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:51.107
when there's thousands of these devices

00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:53.153
roaming the seas?

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:55.429
So you're probably all wondering: the cave.

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:57.255
Did you find the gold?

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:58.807
Well, we didn't find any gold,

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:02.036
but we decided that what we found
was much more valuable.

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:04.508
It was the glimpse into a potential future

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:06.183
for ocean exploration.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:09.093
It's something that's not limited to
the James Camerons of the world,

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:11.688
but something that we're all participating in.

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.021
It's an underwater world

00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:15.532
we're all exploring together.

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:17.707
Thank you.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:21.707
(Applause)
