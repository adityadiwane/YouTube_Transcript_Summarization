00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.209
I'd like to talk today

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.136
about a powerful and fundamental aspect

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:20.734
of who we are: our voice.

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.480
Each one of us has a unique voiceprint

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.769
that reflects our age, our size,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.006
even our lifestyle and personality.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:31.148
In the words of the poet Longfellow,

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:35.018
"the human voice is the organ of the soul."

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.765
As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:39.594
by how the voice is produced,

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:43.252
and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:45.462
That's what I'd like to share with you.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.276
I'm going to start by playing you a sample

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.147
of a voice that you may recognize.

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.451
(Recording) Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.200
it was fairly obvious what I meant."

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.480
Rupal Patel: That was the voice

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.566
of Professor Stephen Hawking.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.415
What you may not know is that same voice

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:02.893
may also be used by this little girl

00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:04.590
who is unable to speak

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.187
because of a neurological condition.

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:09.255
In fact, all of these individuals

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:11.267
may be using the same voice,

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.824
and that's because there's
only a few options available.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:19.141
In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.751
who are unable to speak,

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.373
and many of whom use computerized devices

00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:24.895
to communicate.

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:28.374
Now that's millions of people worldwide

00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:30.026
who are using generic voices,

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:31.472
including Professor Hawking,

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:36.305
who uses an American-accented voice.

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.633
This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.049
really hit home

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.521
when I was at an assistive technology conference

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.371
a few years ago,

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.975
and I recall walking into an exhibit hall

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.019
and seeing a little girl and a grown man

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.935
having a conversation using their devices,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:59.219
different devices, but the same voice.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.128
And I looked around and I saw this happening

00:02:01.128 --> 00:02:05.318
all around me, literally hundreds of individuals

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:08.056
using a handful of voices,

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:11.147
voices that didn't fit their bodies

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.229
or their personalities.

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.956
We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:19.352
with the prosthetic limb of a grown man.

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:22.656
So why then the same prosthetic voice?

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:23.947
It really struck me,

00:02:23.947 --> 00:02:27.098
and I wanted to do something about this.

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.051
I'm going to play you now a sample

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:32.339
of someone who has, two people actually,

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.107
who have severe speech disorders.

00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:37.337
I want you to take a listen to how they sound.

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:39.694
They're saying the same utterance.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:42.126
(First voice)

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:45.743
(Second voice)

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:48.155
You probably didn't understand what they said,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.009
but I hope that you heard

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.292
their unique vocal identities.

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:57.105
So what I wanted to do next is,

00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:59.489
I wanted to find out how we could harness

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.310
these residual vocal abilities

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.326
and build a technology

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.469
that could be customized for them,

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.898
voices that could be customized for them.

00:03:07.898 --> 00:03:10.583
So I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:13.646
Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.679
and what he'd been doing is building

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.560
personalized voices for people

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.657
by putting together

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.807
pre-recorded samples of their voice

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:24.686
and reconstructing a voice for them.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.398
These are people who had lost their voice

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:28.309
later in life.

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.703
We didn't have the luxury

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:31.477
of pre-recorded samples of speech

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.769
for those born with speech disorder.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.306
But I thought, there had to be a way

00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:38.250
to reverse engineer a voice

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.541
from whatever little is left over.

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.255
So we decided to do exactly that.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:46.658
We set out with a little bit of funding
from the National Science Foundation,

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:50.223
to create custom-crafted voices that captured

00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:51.759
their unique vocal identities.

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.962
We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:56.995
for vocal identity.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.669
Now before I get into the details of how

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.717
the voice is made and let you listen to it,

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:05.067
I need to give you a real quick
speech science lesson. Okay?

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.226
So first, we know that the voice is changing

00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:11.080
dramatically over the course of development.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.170
Children sound different from teens

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.633
who sound different from adults.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:17.275
We've all experienced this.

00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:20.638
Fact number two is that speech

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:23.191
is a combination of the source,

00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:26.670
which is the vibrations generated by your voice box,

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.609
which are then pushed through

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:31.046
the rest of the vocal tract.

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:33.530
These are the chambers of your head and neck

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.769
that vibrate,

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:36.879
and they actually filter that source sound

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.416
to produce consonants and vowels.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.276
So the combination of source and filter

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.906
is how we produce speech.

00:04:45.906 --> 00:04:48.932
And that happens in one individual.

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:51.558
Now I told you earlier that I'd spent

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.583
a good part of my career

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.036
understanding and studying

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.994
the source characteristics of people

00:04:57.994 --> 00:05:00.295
with severe speech disorder,

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:01.760
and what I've found

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.126
is that even though their filters were impaired,

00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:08.087
they were able to modulate their source:

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:11.349
the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.717
These are called prosody, and
I've been documenting for years

00:05:14.717 --> 00:05:16.994
that the prosodic abilities of these individuals

00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:18.569
are preserved.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.656
So when I realized that those same cues

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:25.425
are also important for speaker identity,

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.440
I had this idea.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.956
Why don't we take the source

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:32.169
from the person we want the voice to sound like,

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.632
because it's preserved,

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.767
and borrow the filter

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:38.996
from someone about the same age and size,

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.418
because they can articulate speech,

00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:43.209
and then mix them?

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.996
Because when we mix them,

00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:46.694
we can get a voice that's as clear

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.448
as our surrogate talker --

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.043
that's the person we borrowed the filter fromâ€”

00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:55.692
and is similar in identity to our target talker.

00:05:55.692 --> 00:05:57.119
It's that simple.

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.053
That's the science behind what we're doing.

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:03.586
So once you have that in mind,

00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:05.844
how do you go about building this voice?

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:07.324
Well, you have to find someone

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:09.724
who is willing to be a surrogate.

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:11.988
It's not such an ominous thing.

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:13.511
Being a surrogate donor

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:16.299
only requires you to say a few hundred

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:18.541
to a few thousand utterances.

00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:20.544
The process goes something like this.

00:06:20.544 --> 00:06:22.734
(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:24.659
I love to sleep.

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.541
The sky is blue without clouds.

00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:30.543
RP: Now she's going to go on like this

00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:32.462
for about three to four hours,

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:35.467
and the idea is not for her to say everything

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:37.512
that the target is going to want to say,

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:40.907
but the idea is to cover all the different combinations

00:06:40.907 --> 00:06:44.178
of the sounds that occur in the language.

00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:45.816
The more speech you have,

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:48.121
the better sounding voice you're going to have.

00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:49.794
Once you have those recordings,

00:06:49.794 --> 00:06:51.207
what we need to do

00:06:51.207 --> 00:06:53.925
is we have to parse these recordings

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:56.374
into little snippets of speech,

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.711
one- or two-sound combinations,

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:00.594
sometimes even whole words

00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:05.110
that start populating a dataset or a database.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.827
We're going to call this database a voice bank.

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:10.923
Now the power of the voice bank

00:07:10.923 --> 00:07:12.937
is that from this voice bank,

00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:14.948
we can now say any new utterance,

00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:16.372
like, "I love chocolate" --

00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:18.111
everyone needs to be able to say thatâ€”

00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:19.942
fish through that database

00:07:19.942 --> 00:07:21.882
and find all the segments necessary

00:07:21.882 --> 00:07:23.811
to say that utterance.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.600
(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.991
RP: So that's speech synthesis.

00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:29.564
It's called concatenative synthesis,
and that's what we're using.

00:07:29.564 --> 00:07:31.097
That's not the novel part.

00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:33.318
What's novel is how we make it sound

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:34.775
like this young woman.

00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:36.299
This is Samantha.

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:38.645
I met her when she was nine,

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:40.542
and since then, my team and I

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:43.256
have been trying to build her a personalized voice.

00:07:43.256 --> 00:07:46.355
We first had to find a surrogate donor,

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:48.173
and then we had to have Samantha

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:50.102
produce some utterances.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.481
What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.960
but that's enough for us to extract

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.245
her source characteristics.

00:07:57.245 --> 00:08:00.516
What happens next is best described

00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:03.283
by my daughter's analogy. She's six.

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:08.705
She calls it mixing colors to paint voices.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.260
It's beautiful. It's exactly that.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.120
Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.729
of red food dye which we can infuse

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:19.269
into the recordings of her surrogate

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:23.656
to get a pink voice just like this.

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:28.147
(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.

00:08:28.147 --> 00:08:30.955
RP: So now, Samantha can say this.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:34.024
(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:40.329
I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:46.746
RP: Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:49.079
I'll never forget the gentle smile

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:50.981
that spread across her face

00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:54.630
when she heard that voice for the first time.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.512
Now there's millions of people

00:08:56.512 --> 00:08:59.345
around the world like Samantha, millions,

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:02.785
and we've only begun to scratch the surface.

00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:04.427
What we've done so far is we have

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:08.286
a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.

00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:09.793
who have donated their voices,

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.721
and we have been using those

00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:16.193
to build our first few personalized voices.

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:17.949
But there's so much more work to be done.

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:20.137
For Samantha, her surrogate

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:23.183
came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger

00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:27.024
who gave her the gift of voice.

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.177
And as a scientist, I'm so excited

00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:31.112
to take this work out of the laboratory

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.912
and finally into the real world

00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:36.077
so it can have real-world impact.

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:37.659
What I want to share with you next

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.834
is how I envision taking this work

00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:42.545
to that next level.

00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:46.432
I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors

00:09:46.432 --> 00:09:49.692
from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,

00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:52.750
coming together in this voice drive

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.020
to give people voices

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.819
that are as colorful as their personalities.

00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:01.119
To do that as a first step,

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:04.394
we've put together this website, VocaliD.org,

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:06.018
as a way to bring together those

00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:08.693
who want to join us as voice donors,

00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:10.465
as expertise donors,

00:10:10.465 --> 00:10:15.804
in whatever way to make this vision a reality.

00:10:15.804 --> 00:10:19.957
They say that giving blood can save lives.

00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:24.939
Well, giving your voice can change lives.

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:27.989
All we need is a few hours of speech

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:29.480
from our surrogate talker,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.213
and as little as a vowel from our target talker,

00:10:34.213 --> 00:10:37.924
to create a unique vocal identity.

00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:40.550
So that's the science behind what we're doing.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.005
I want to end by circling back to the human side

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:49.107
that is really the inspiration for this work.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:52.806
About five years ago, we built our very first voice

00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:55.307
for a little boy named William.

00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:57.664
When his mom first heard this voice,

00:10:57.664 --> 00:11:00.009
she said, "This is what William

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:01.555
would have sounded like

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:04.004
had he been able to speak."

00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:06.422
And then I saw William typing a message

00:11:06.422 --> 00:11:07.784
on his device.

00:11:07.784 --> 00:11:11.077
I wondered, what was he thinking?

00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:14.667
Imagine carrying around someone else's voice

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.860
for nine years

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.704
and finally finding your own voice.

00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:23.081
Imagine that.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.878
This is what William said:

00:11:25.878 --> 00:11:30.341
"Never heard me before."

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:34.036
Thank you.

00:11:34.036 --> 00:11:38.760
(Applause)
