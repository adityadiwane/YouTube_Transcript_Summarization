00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
The world is changing

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
with really remarkable speed.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
If you look at the chart at the top here,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
you'll see that in 2025,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
these Goldman Sachs projections

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
suggest that the Chinese economy

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
will be almost the same size as the American economy.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
And if you look at the chart

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
for 2050,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
it's projected that the Chinese economy

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
will be twice the size of the American economy,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
and the Indian economy will be almost the same size

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
as the American economy.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
And we should bear in mind here

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
that these projections were drawn up

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
before the Western financial crisis.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
A couple of weeks ago,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I was looking at the latest projection

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
by BNP Paribas

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
for when China

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
will have a larger economy

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
than the United States.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Goldman Sachs projected 2027.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The post-crisis projection

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
is 2020.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.260
That's just a decade away.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260
China is going to change the world

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
in two fundamental respects.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
First of all,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
it's a huge developing country

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.260
with a population of 1.3 billion people,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
which has been growing for over 30 years

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
at around 10 percent a year.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And within a decade,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
it will have the largest economy in the world.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Never before in the modern era

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
has the largest economy in the world

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
been that of a developing country,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
rather than a developed country.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Secondly,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
for the first time in the modern era,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
the dominant country in the world --

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
which I think is what China will become --

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
will be not from the West

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and from very, very different civilizational roots.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
that as countries modernize,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
they also westernize.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
This is an illusion.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
It's an assumption that modernity

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.260
is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
It is not. It is also shaped equally

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
by history and culture.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
China is not like the West,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and it will not become like the West.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
It will remain in very fundamental respects

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
very different.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
Now the big question here is obviously,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
how do we make sense of China?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
How do we try to understand what China is?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
is that the conventional approach

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
is that we understand it really in Western terms,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
using Western ideas.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
We can't.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Now I want to offer you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
three building blocks

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
for trying to understand what China is like,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
just as a beginning.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
The first is this:

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260
that China is not really a nation-state.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
for the last hundred years,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
but everyone who knows anything about China

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
knows it's a lot older than this.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
the birth of modern China.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
still 2,000 years ago.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And you can see already it occupies

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
most of what we now know as Eastern China,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and live now.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
Now what is extraordinary about this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
is, what gives China its sense of being China,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
what gives the Chinese

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
the sense of what it is to be Chinese,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
comes not from the last hundred years,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260
not from the nation-state period,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.260
which is what happened in the West,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
but from the period, if you like,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
of the civilization-state.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
I'm thinking here, for example,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
of customs like ancestral worship,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
of a very distinctive notion of the state,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
social relationships like guanxi,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
Confucian values and so on.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
These are all things that come

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
from the period of the civilization-state.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.260
In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
is shaped by its sense of civilization,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
its existence as a civilization-state,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
rather than as a nation-state.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Of course we know China's big, huge,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
demographically and geographically,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
with a population of 1.3 billion people.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
What we often aren't really aware of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
is the fact

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that China is extremely diverse

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
and very pluralistic,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
and in many ways very decentralized.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
even though we think this to be the case.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
It's never been the case.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
So this is China, a civilization-state,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
rather than a nation-state.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
And what does it mean?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
I'll give you two quick ones.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
The first is that

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the most important political value for the Chinese

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
is unity,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
is the maintenance

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
of Chinese civilization.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
China, over the same time period,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
went in exactly the opposite direction,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
very painfully holding this huge civilization,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
civilization-state, together.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
The second

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
is maybe more prosaic,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
which is Hong Kong.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.260
by Britain to China in 1997?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
You may remember

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
One country, two systems.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
And I'll lay a wager

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
that barely anyone in the West believed them.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
"Window dressing.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
that won't be the case."

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
Thirteen years on,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
the political and legal system in Hong Kong

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
is as different now as it was in 1997.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
in nation-state ways.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Think of German unification, 1990.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
What happened?

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
One nation, one system.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
That is the nation-state mentality.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
But you can't run a country like China,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
a civilization-state,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
on the basis of one civilization, one system.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
It doesn't work.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
So actually the response of China

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
to the question of Hong Kong --

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
as it will be to the question of Taiwan --

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.260
was a natural response:

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
one civilization, many systems.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Let me offer you another building block

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
to try and understand China --

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
maybe not sort of a comfortable one.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
The Chinese have a very, very different

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
conception of race

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
to most other countries.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.260
Do you know,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
of the 1.3 billion Chinese,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
over 90 percent of them

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.260
think they belong to the same race,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
the Han?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
Now, this is completely different

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.260
from the world's [other] most populous countries.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
India, the United States,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
Indonesia, Brazil --

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
all of them are multiracial.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.260
The Chinese don't feel like that.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
China is only multiracial

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
really at the margins.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So the question is, why?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Well the reason, I think, essentially

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
is, again, back to the civilization-state.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
A history of at least 2,000 years,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
a history of conquest, occupation,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
absorption, assimilation and so on,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
led to the process by which,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.260
over time, this notion of the Han emerged --

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
of course, nurtured

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
by a growing and very powerful sense

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.260
of cultural identity.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Now the great advantage of this historical experience

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.260
has been that, without the Han,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
China could never have held together.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
The Han identity has been the cement

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
which has held this country together.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
The great disadvantage of it

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
is that the Han have a very weak conception

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
of cultural difference.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.260
They really believe

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.260
in their own superiority,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.260
and they are disrespectful

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.260
of those who are not.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
Hence their attitude, for example,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.260
Or let me give you my third building block,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
the Chinese state.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Now the relationship

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.260
between the state and society in China

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.260
is very different from that in the West.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
Now we in the West

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.260
that the authority and legitimacy of the state

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
is a function of democracy.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
The problem with this proposition

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.260
is that the Chinese state

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
enjoys more legitimacy

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.260
and more authority

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
amongst the Chinese

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
than is true

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
with any Western state.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
And the reason for this

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
is because --

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
well, there are two reasons, I think.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And the reason for this is,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.260
firstly, because the state in China

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
is given a very special --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
it enjoys a very special significance

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
as the representative,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260
the embodiment and the guardian

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.260
of Chinese civilization,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.260
of the civilization-state.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
This is as close as China gets

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
to a kind of spiritual role.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And the second reason is because,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
whereas in Europe

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and North America,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
the state's power is continuously challenged --

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
I mean in the European tradition,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
historically against the church,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
against other sectors of the aristocracy,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
against merchants and so on --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
for 1,000 years,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
the power of the Chinese state

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
has not been challenged.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
It's had no serious rivals.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
So you can see

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that the way in which power has been constructed in China

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
is very different from our experience

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260
in Western history.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
The result, by the way,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.260
is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
a stranger,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
certainly an organ

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.260
whose powers need to be limited

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
or defined and constrained,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
The Chinese view the state

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.260
as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.260
as a member of the family --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.260
not just in fact as a member of the family,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
but as the head of the family,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
the patriarch of the family.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.260
This is the Chinese view of the state --

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.260
very, very different to ours.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.260
It's embedded in society in a different kind of way

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
to what is the case

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
in the West.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
in the Chinese context,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
is a new kind of paradigm,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
which is different from anything

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
we've had to think about in the past.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Know that China believes in the market and the state.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
I mean, Adam Smith,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
already writing in the late 18th century, said,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
"The Chinese market is larger and more developed

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.260
and more sophisticated

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
than anything in Europe."

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And, apart from the Mao period,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
that has remained more or less the case ever since.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
But this is combined

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.260
with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.260
The state is everywhere in China.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260
I mean, it's leading firms --

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
many of them are still publicly owned.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
depend in many ways on state patronage.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Targets for the economy and so on

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
are set by the state.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
as we are familiar with --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
with something like the one-child policy.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.260
a very old tradition of statecraft.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.260
I mean, if you want an illustration of this,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
the Great Wall is one.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
But this is another, this is the Grand Canal,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
which was constructed in the first instance

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.260
in the fifth century B.C.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.260
and was finally completed

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
in the seventh century A.D.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.260
It went for 1,114 miles,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
linking Beijing

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.260
with Hangzhou and Shanghai.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
So there's a long history

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.260
of extraordinary state infrastructural projects

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
in China,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
which is something like the Three Gorges Dam

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
and many other expressions

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
of state competence

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
within China.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
So there we have three building blocks

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
for trying to understand the difference that is China --

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
the civilization-state,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
the notion of race

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
and the nature of the state

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
and its relationship to society.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
And yet we still insist, by and large,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.260
in thinking that we can understand China

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
by simply drawing on Western experience,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
looking at it through Western eyes,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
using Western concepts.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
If you want to know why

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
we unerringly seem to get China wrong --

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.260
our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.260
this is the reason.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
Unfortunately, I think,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
I have to say that I think

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
attitude towards China

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
It's kind of arrogant.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
It's arrogant in the sense

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
that we think that we are best,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and therefore we have the universal measure.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
And secondly, it's ignorant.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
We refuse to really address

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
the issue of difference.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
You know, there's a very interesting passage

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And Paul Cohen argues

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.260
that the West thinks of itself

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
as probably the most cosmopolitan

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
of all cultures.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
But it's not.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
In many ways,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.260
it's the most parochial,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
because for 200 years,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
the West has been so dominant in the world

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.260
that it's not really needed

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
to understand other cultures,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
other civilizations.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
Because, at the end of the day,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.260
it could, if necessary by force,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
get its own way.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
Whereas those cultures --

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
virtually the rest of the world, in fact,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.260
have been thereby forced to understand the West,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
because of the West's presence in those societies.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.260
And therefore, they are, as a result,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.260
more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
I mean, take the question of East Asia.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.260
a third of the world's population lives there.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Now the largest economic region in the world.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
And I'll tell you now,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
that East Asianers, people from East Asia,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
are far more knowledgeable

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
about the West

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.260
than the West is about East Asia.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
to the present.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260
the Goldman Sachs chart.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
What is happening

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
is that, very rapidly in historical terms,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.260
the world is being driven

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and shaped,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
not by the old developed countries,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
but by the developing world.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
We've seen this

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
in terms of the G20

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
usurping very rapidly the position of the G7,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260
or the G8.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260
And there are two consequences of this.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.260
First, the West

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.260
is rapidly losing

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
its influence in the world.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.260
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.260
Copenhagen, climate change conference.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.260
Europe was not at the final negotiating table.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260
When did that last happen?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.260
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
And that is what is going to happen in the future.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
And the second implication

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.260
become increasingly unfamiliar to us,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.260
because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260
that we are not really familiar with,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
or conversant with.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
America is slightly different --

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260
but Europeans by and large, I have to say,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.260
are ignorant,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
are unaware

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.260
about the way the world is changing.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.260
Some people -- I've got an English friend in China,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260
and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260
Well, maybe that's true,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.260
maybe that's an exaggeration.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.260
But there's another problem which goes along with this --

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260
that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.260
and that is a sort of

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.260
loss of a sense of the future.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.260
in its confidence.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.260
Take the 19th century, for example.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260
But this, alas, is no longer true.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260
If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
try China -- there's old Confucius.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260
This is a railway station

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.260
the likes of which you've never seen before.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
It doesn't even look like a railway station.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.260
This is the new [Wuhan] railway station

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
for the high-speed trains.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
China already has a bigger network

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.260
than any other country in the world

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.260
and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.260
Or take this: now this is an idea,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260
but it's an idea to be tried out shortly

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.260
in a suburb of Beijing.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.260
Here you have a megabus,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.260
on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260
It travels on rails

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
down a suburban road,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.260
and the cars travel underneath it.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.260
Now this is the way things are going to move,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.260
because China has a very specific problem,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
which is different from Europe

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260
and different from the United States:

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.260
China has huge numbers of people and no space.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260
So this is a solution to a situation

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260
where China's going to have

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.260
many, many, many cities

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.260
over 20 million people.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260
Okay, so how would I like to finish?

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.260
Well, what should our attitude be

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260
towards this world

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.260
that we see

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.260
very rapidly developing

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260
before us?

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.260
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.260
But I want to argue, above all,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.260
a big-picture positive for this world.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.260
For 200 years,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.260
the world was essentially governed

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.260
by a fragment of the human population.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.260
That's what Europe and North America represented.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.260
The arrival of countries

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.260
like China and India --

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.260
between them 38 percent of the world's population --

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.260
and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260
represent the most important single act

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.260
of democratization

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
in the last 200 years.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.260
Civilizations and cultures,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.260
which had been ignored, which had no voice,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.260
which were not listened to, which were not known about,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.260
will have a different sort

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.260
of representation in this world.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.260
As humanists, we must welcome, surely,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.260
this transformation,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.260
and we will have to learn

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.260
about these civilizations.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.260
This big ship here

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.260
was the one sailed in by Zheng He

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.260
in the early 15th century

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
on his great voyages

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.260
around the South China Sea, the East China Sea

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.260
and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.260
The little boat in front of it

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.260
was the one in which, 80 years later,

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.260
Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
(Laughter)

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
Or, look carefully

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.260
at this silk scroll

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.260
made by ZhuZhou

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.260
in 1368.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.260
I think they're playing golf.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.260
Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.260
Welcome to the future. Thank you.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.260
(Applause)
