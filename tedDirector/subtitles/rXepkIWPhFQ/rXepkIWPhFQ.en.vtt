00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Good morning everybody.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330
The first thing is water.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
that's been provided for you here at the conference,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
over the past couple of days.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.330
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
But what if it wasn't?

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
What if it was from a source like this?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.330
Then statistics would actually say

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
that half of you would now be suffering

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.330
with diarrhea.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.330
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
But they just don't seem to get through.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
And I think I've worked out why.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
It's because, using current thinking,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
the scale of the problem

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330
just seems too huge to contemplate solving.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330
So we just switch off:

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
us, governments and aid agencies.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
Well, today, I'd like to show you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
that through thinking differently,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
the problem has been solved.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
By the way, since I've been speaking,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
another 13,000 people around the world

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
are suffering now with diarrhea.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
And four children have just died.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
I invented Lifesaver bottle

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.330
because I got angry.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.330
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
when I was watching the devastating news

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
playing out on TV.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
The days and weeks that followed,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
people fleeing to the hills,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
being forced to drink contaminated water

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
or face death.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
That really stuck with me.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
Then, a few months later,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Day one: nothing.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
Day two: nothing.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.330
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
People were shooting each other on the streets

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
for TV sets and water.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.330
That's when I decided I had to do something.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.330
However, after a few failed prototypes,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.330
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Okay, now for the science bit.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.330
of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.330
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330
So a 200-nanometer bacteria

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.330
is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330
The smallest virus, on the other hand,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
is about 25 nanometers.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.330
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.330
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
So nothing is getting through.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Would you like to see that?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
We're in the fine city of Oxford.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
So -- someone's done that up.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
and got some water from the River Cherwell,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
and the River Thames,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330
that flow through here. And this is the water.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330
But I got to thinking, you know,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
if we were in the middle of a flood zone

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.330
And this is from my pond.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.330
(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
Okay. (Laughs) Right.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
We're just going to pour that in there.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
Audience: Ugh!

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.330
from a sewage plant farm.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
So I'm just going to put that in there.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.330
(Laughter)

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Put that in there. There we go.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.330
(Laughter)

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.330
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.330
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.330
So we're just going to put that in there as well.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.330
(Laughter)

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.330
Okay. (Laughter) Now.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.330
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
You just scoop the water up.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Today I'm going to use a jug

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.330
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.330
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.330
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.330
(Laughter)

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Okay. There we go.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.330
Replace the top.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.330
Give it a few pumps. Okay?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
That's all that's necessary.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.330
Now as soon as I pop the teat,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
sterile drinking water is going to come out.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.330
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
There we go. Mind the electrics.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
That is safe, sterile drinking water.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.330
(Applause)

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330
Cheers.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
(Applause)

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
There you go Chris.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.330
(Applause)

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330
What's it taste of?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
Chris Anderson: Delicious.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
Michael Pritchard: Okay.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
(Laughter)

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.330
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
It'll last for 6,000 liters.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
the system will shut off, protecting the user.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.330
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.330
It's good for another 6,000 liters.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330
So let's look at the applications.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.330
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.330
We ship water.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.330
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.330
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.330
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
Diseases spread. More resources are required.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.330
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.330
But by thinking differently,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.330
and shipping these,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.330
people can stay put.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
They can make their own sterile drinking water,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.330
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
for this to work.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
and pipe work, is too expensive.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
When you run the numbers on a calculator,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
you run out of noughts.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
So here is the "thinking different" bit.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Instead of shipping water,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.330
and using man-made processes to do it,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.330
She picks the water up from there,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.330
desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.330
And where do people live? Near water.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.330
All we've go to do

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.330
is make it sterile. How do we do that?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
Or we could use one of these.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.330
The same technology, in a jerry can.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330
This will process 25,000 liters of water;

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
that's good enough for a family of four,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.330
for three years.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
And how much does it cost?

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.330
About half a cent a day to run.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.330
Thank you.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
(Applause)

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
So, by thinking differently, and processing water

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
at the point of use,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
to collect their water.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.330
They can get it from a source nearby.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.330
So with just eight billion dollars,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
we can hit the millennium goal's target

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.330
of halving the number of people

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.330
without access to safe drinking water.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
To put that into context,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.330
a year on foreign aid.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.330
But why stop there?

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.330
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
So the three-and-a-half billion people

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.330
that suffer every year as a result,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.330
and the two million kids that die every year,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.330
will live.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
Thank you.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.330
(Applause)
