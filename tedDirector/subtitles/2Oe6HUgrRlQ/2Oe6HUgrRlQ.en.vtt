00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
One of the most common ways of dividing the world

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
is into those who believe

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
and those who don't --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
into the religious and the atheists.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And for the last decade or so,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
it's been quite clear

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
what being an atheist means.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
There have been some very vocal atheists

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
who've pointed out,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
not just that religion is wrong,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
but that it's ridiculous.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
have argued --

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
they've argued that believing in God

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
is akin to believing in fairies

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and essentially that the whole thing

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
is a childish game.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Now I think it's too easy.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
I think it's too easy

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And what I'd like to inaugurate today

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
is a new way of being an atheist --

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
if you like, a new version of atheism

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
we could call Atheism 2.0.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Well it starts from a very basic premise:

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
of course, there's no God.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
or angels, etc.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
that's the very, very beginning.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I'm interested in the kind of constituency

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
that thinks something along these lines:

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
I can't believe in the doctrines.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I don't think these doctrines are right.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I really like the art of Mantegna.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
I really like looking at old churches.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Whatever it may be,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
the moralistic, communal side of religion,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
but can't bear the doctrine.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and then you can have all the nice stuff,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
or you reject the doctrine and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
So that's a sort of tough choice.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
I don't think we have to make that choice.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I think there is an alternative.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
I think there are ways --

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
of stealing from religions.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
If you don't believe in a religion,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
with taking out the best sides of religion.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
And for me, atheism 2.0

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
is about both, as I say,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
a respectful and an impious way

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The secular world is full of holes.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
We have secularized badly, I would argue.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
And a thorough study of religion

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
could give us all sorts of insights

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
into areas of life that are not going too well.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Now education is a field

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
the secular world really believes in.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
it's also going to make us better people.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
those lyrical claims

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
will make us into nobler and better human beings.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
That's a lovely idea.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Interesting where it came from.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
In the early 19th century,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
church attendance in Western Europe

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
They asked themselves the following question.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.260
They said, where are people going to find the morality,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
where are they going to find guidance,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
And influential voices came up with one answer.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
They said culture.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
It's to culture that we should look

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And that's a very plausible idea.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
If you went to a top university --

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and you said, "I've come here

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
I want to know how to live,"

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
are in the business of.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Why? They don't think we need it.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260
They see us as adults, rational adults.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
What we need is information.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
We need data, we don't need help.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
All religions, all major religions,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
at various points call us children.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And like children,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
We're only just holding it together.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.260
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
advising people how they could live.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and children to their parents,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
He was trying to tell people how they should live

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
through the medium of sermons,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the classic medium of delivery of religions.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.260
"Hey, how about a sermon?"

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I'm an independent, individual person."

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
What's the difference between a sermon

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.260
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
Well a sermon wants to change your life

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.260
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
because we are in need of guidance,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
morality and consolation --

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
and religions know that.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Another point about education:

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
we tend to believe in the modern secular world

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.260
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
and that lesson will stick with them.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
Religions go, "Nonsense.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.260
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.260
So get on your knees and repeat it."

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.260
That's what all religions tell us:

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.260
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So religions are cultures of repetition.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
They circle the great truths again and again and again.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
We associate repetition with boredom.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
"Give us the new," we're always saying.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
"The new is better than the old."

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.260
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
We're just going to run through all the old ones

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
and watch them five times because they're so true.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.260
because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
The other things that religions do

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
is to arrange time.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
All the major religions give us calendars.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
What is a calendar?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
you will bump into certain very important ideas.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.260
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
and his qualities of humility and goodness

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and his generosity to the poor.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
Now we don't think that way.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
I'll just come across it."

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.260
Nonsense, says the religious world view.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.260
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
we need to synchronize encounters.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
This comes across also

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260
in the way in which religions set up rituals

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
around important feelings.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.260
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
You know, when you look at the Moon,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.260
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.260
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
where you will be given poems to read

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
You'll be handed rice cakes.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
will have a secure place in your heart.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
That's very good.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
The other thing that religions are really aware of

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260
is: speak well --

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
and still have a great career.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
But the religious world doesn't think that way.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
What you're saying needs to be backed up

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
by a really convincing way of saying it.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
in the American South

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
and you listen to how they talk,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
my goodness, they talk well.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.260
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.260
If we were doing it like they do it --

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.260
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.260
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
(Applause)

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.260
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.260
we are also bodies.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
And when they teach us a lesson,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.260
they do it via the body.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.260
So for example,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
Jews are very interested in forgiveness

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
and how we should start anew and start afresh.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
They don't just give us books or words about this.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
They tell us to have a bath.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.260
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
You immerse yourself in the water,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.260
We don't tend to do that.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.260
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
Let's look at art now.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.260
Now art is something that in the secular world,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.260
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
We sometimes hear it said

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
You've heard that saying.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
Now I think that the potential is there,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
but we've completely let ourselves down.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
And the reason we've let ourselves down

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
is that we're not properly studying

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.260
how religions handle art.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.260
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
a ridiculous idea --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
I couldn't disagree more.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.260
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.260
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.260
and we might find it too easy.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
let's admit it --

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
is, "I don't know what this is about."

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.260
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.260
to contemporary art.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
Firstly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260
of what there is to love.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.260
And secondly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
of what there is to fear and to hate.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.260
And that's what art is.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.260
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.260
So as you walk around a church,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.260
or a mosque or a cathedral,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
through your eyes, through your senses,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
Essentially it's propaganda.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.260
Rembrandt is a propagandist

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
in the Christian view.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.260
And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
if I was a museum curator,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.260
I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
All works of art are talking to us about things.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
And if we were able to arrange spaces

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
where we could come across works

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260
where we would be told, use these works of art

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.260
to cement these ideas in your mind,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
we would get a lot more out of art.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
Art should be one of the tools

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
by which we improve our society.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.260
Art should be didactic.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Let's think of something else.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
who are interested in matters of the spirit,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
in matters of the mind,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.260
in higher soul-like concerns,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
tend to be isolated individuals.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
And they tend to be on their own.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
And they don't really change much.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
Now think about religions, think about organized religions.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.260
What do organized religions do?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
They group together, they form institutions.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
And that has all sorts of advantages.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
First of all, scale, might.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
according to the Wall Street Journal.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
These are massive machines.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.260
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and they're highly disciplined.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
These are all very good qualities.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.260
We recognize them in relation to corporations.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
And corporations are very like religions in many ways,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
They're selling us shoes and cars.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.260
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260
the therapists, the poets --

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
are on their own and they have no power,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.260
they have no might.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
So religions are the foremost example

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.260
of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.260
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
but we can admire the institutional way

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
in which they're doing it.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260
are not going to change anything.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.260
We need to group together.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And that's what religions do.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
They are multinational, as I say,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.260
they are branded, they have a clear identity,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
so they don't get lost in a busy world.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
That's something we can learn from.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
I want to conclude.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.260
Really what I want to say

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.260
is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260
there is something to learn from the example of religion --

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.260
even if you don't believe any of it.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
If you're involved in anything that's communal,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
that involves lots of people getting together,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
there are things for you in religion.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
look at pilgrimage.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
Look very closely at pilgrimage.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
We haven't begun to scratch the surface

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
of what travel could be

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
If you're in the art world,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
look at the example of what religions are doing with art.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.260
And if you're an educator in any way,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
You may not agree with the ideas,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
So really my concluding point

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260
is you may not agree with religion,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.260
but at the end of the day,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
religions are so subtle, so complicated,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
so intelligent in many ways

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.260
they're for all of us.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Thank you very much.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:33.260
(Applause)

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
to be ridiculed in some quarters.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
AB: You can get shot by both sides.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.260
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
and you can get shot by those who fully believe.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.260
CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.260
AB: Indeed.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.260
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.260
that a lot of people might say

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
your agenda could borrow from,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
which is this sense --

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260
that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.260
of spiritual experience,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
of some kind of connection

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.260
with something that's bigger than you are.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260
something else?"

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.260
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.260
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.260
Science and just observation

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.260
gives us that feeling without it,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.260
so I don't feel the need.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260
The universe is large and we are tiny,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.260
without the need for further religious superstructure.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.260
So one can have so-called spiritual moments

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.260
without belief in the spirit.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.260
How many people here would say

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260
that religion is important to them?

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Is there an equivalent process

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260
by which there's a sort of bridge

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260
between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260
AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
and these can be plugged.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260
It's not as though, as I try to suggest,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260
it's not as though either you have religion

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.260
and then you have to accept all sorts of things,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.260
or you don't have religion

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.260
and then you're cut off from all these very good things.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.260
It's so sad that we constantly say,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260
"I don't believe so I can't have community,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260
so I'm cut off from morality,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260
so I can't go on a pilgrimage."

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.260
And that's really the spirit of my talk.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.260
There's so much we can absorb.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260
who are atheists.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
But probably most people in the community

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.260
certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.260
and want to find the language

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260
to have a constructive dialogue

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260
and to feel like we can actually talk to each other

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and at least share some things in common.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.260
Are we foolish to be optimistic

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260
about the possibility of a world

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.260
where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.260
of divide and war,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
that there could be bridging?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.260
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.260
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.260
It's seen as hypocrisy.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.260
But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260
and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.260
you politely ignore it.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260
You move on.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.260
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.260
because you have a shared view on so many things,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.260
and you politely differ.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.260
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260
They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.260
CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260
that's not a religion but something else,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.260
does it need a leader,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.260
and are you volunteering to be the pope?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
(Laughter)

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.260
AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.260
is individual leaders.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
It doesn't need it.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260
What I've tried to lay out is a framework

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.260
and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.260
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.260
If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.260
So it's a wiki project.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.260
(Laughter)

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.260
CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.260
(Applause)
