00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
I believe that there are new, hidden tensions

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
that are actually happening between people and institutions --

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
institutions that are the institutions that people

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
inhabit in their daily life:

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
schools, hospitals, workplaces,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
factories, offices, etc.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
And something that I see happening

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
is something that I would like to call

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
a sort of "democratization of intimacy."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
And what do I mean by that?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
I mean that what people are doing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.260
they are breaking an imposed isolation

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.260
that these institutions are imposing on them.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
How are they doing this? They're doing it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
by IMing from their office to their friends,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
by texting under the desk.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
The pictures that you're seeing behind me

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
are people that I visited in the last few months.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
One young woman brought her grandfather.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
people are communicating on a regular basis

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.260
with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
Now, lets take some data. Facebook.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Recently some sociologists from Facebook --

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Facebook is the channel that you would expect

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
is the most enlargening of all channels.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And an average user,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
said Cameron Marlow,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
from Facebook, has about 120 friends.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
But he actually talks to,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
on a regular base, depending on his gender.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Academic research on instant messaging

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
also shows 100 people on buddy lists,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
anyway, less than five.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260
My own research on cellphones and voice calls

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
shows that 80 percent of the calls

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
are actually made to four people. 80 percent.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.260
when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
And some sociologists actually feel that

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260
it's a closure, it's a cocooning,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
that we're disengaging from the public.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And I would actually, I would like to show you that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
if we actually look at who is doing it,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
and from where they're doing it,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
actually there is an incredible social transformation.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
The first gentleman, he's a baker.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
cleans his hands from the flour

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
and calls his wife.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
And I've heard this story a number of times.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
A young factory worker who works night shifts,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
who manages to sneak away from the factory floor,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
where there is CCTV by the way,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Or a mother who, at four o'clock,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.260
to check that her children are safely home.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
They Skype with their families a few times a week.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.260
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
pull out the webcam and actually have dinner

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
from a very modest family

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
They had set up a big screen in their living room,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.260
and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
who is working on Filipina migrant women

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.260
who leave their children back in the Philippines,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
was telling me about how much parenting is going on

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
through Skype,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.260
and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.260
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And finally, finally, they've managed to put

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
instant messaging on their computers at work.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
And now, obviously, they have it open.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
And this is exactly what we've been seeing

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
and texting under the table to their friends.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
So, none of these cases are unique.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
But what is really exceptional is the setting.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
factory, migration, office.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
it could be a hospital.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.260
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
if you just think back 15 years,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
when you clocked in,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
when you clocked in to an office,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
when you clocked in to a factory,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
there was no contact for the whole duration of the time,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
there was no contact with your private sphere.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.260
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Maybe you had a direct line.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
But basically, when you walked into those buildings,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
the private sphere was left behind you.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.260
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
such a norm and such an expectation.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
And it had nothing to do with technical capability.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
your commitment was fully to the task at hand,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.260
fully to the people around you.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.260
That was where the focus had to be.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.260
And this has become such a cultural norm

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.260
that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.260
are just dedicated to take away the children,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.260
to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And then the school enacts perfectly well.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
rituals of entry, rituals of exit,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.260
the schedules, the uniforms in this country,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
things that identify you, team-building activities,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.260
team building that will allow you to basically

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
that you will have to be with for a number of time.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.260
And of course, the major thing:

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
learn to pay attention,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
to concentrate and focus your attention.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
This only started about 150 years ago.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.260
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
and of industrial revolution.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
and carry out the work.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
and the public sphere.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.260
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260
They were living on top of the land they were laboring.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
even our cities.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
that are well distinct from production areas

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and commercial areas.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
And actually, over these 150 years,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.260
there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.260
So the lower the status of the job

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
and of the person carrying out, the more removed

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
he would be from his personal sphere.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
People have taken this amazing possibility

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
of actually being in contact all through the day

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
or in all types of situations.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
And they are doing it massively.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
The Pew Institute, which produces good data

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.260
on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
says that -- and I think that this number is conservative --

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.260
50 percent of anybody with email access at work

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
is actually doing private email from his office.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.260
I really think that the number is conservative.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.260
is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
75 percent of people admit doing private

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
conversations from work on their mobile phones.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
100 percent are using text.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.260
The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
is not terribly successful with all institutions.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
I'm always surprised the U.S. Army

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
sociologists are discussing of the impact

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
for instance, of soldiers in Iraq

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.260
having daily contact with their families.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.260
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
And every day, every single day,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
I read news that makes me cringe,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
like a $15 fine

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
to kids in Texas,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.260
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.260
Behind issues of security and safety,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.260
which have always been the arguments for social control,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
in fact what is going on is that

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.260
these institutions are trying to decide

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.260
to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
