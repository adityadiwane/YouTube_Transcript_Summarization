00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:15.259
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation
was on Facebook,

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.233
and it was three days long.

00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:18.681
(Laughter)

00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:21.837
We shared over 3,000 messages between us,

00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:25.516
and it was during those 72 hours
that I knew she was going to be my wife.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.234
We didn't wait any prerequisite
amount of time for our courtship;

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.613
we told each other
the vulnerable truths up front:

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:33.881
I am a transgender man,

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.315
which means the F on my birth
certificate should have stood for "False,"

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.519
instead of "Female."

00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:39.878
(Laughter)

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:41.786
Walking around as a woman in the world

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.132
felt like walking with
pebbles in my shoes.

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.247
It took the rhythm out of my swagger,

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:47.531
it threw me off balance,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.664
it pained me with every step
I took forward.

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:52.292
But today I'm a man of my own intention;

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:53.838
a man of my own design.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.006
Kim Katrin Milan: I am
a cisgender queer woman.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.798
Cisgender means the gender
I was assigned at birth

00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:02.094
is still and has always been female.

00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:05.055
This doesn't make me natural or normal,

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.015
this is just one way of describing
the many different ways

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.710
that we exist in this world.

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.984
And queer is a cultural term,

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:13.205
but in this case,

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.852
it refers to the way that I'm not
restricted by gender

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.581
when it comes to choosing partners.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.636
I've identified in a few different ways --

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.270
as a bisexual, as a lesbian --

00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:22.371
but for me,

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:27.244
queerness encompasses all of the layers
of who I am and how I've loved.

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:29.534
I'm layers, and not fractions.

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:31.349
And for me,

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:32.706
the fact that he was queer

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.112
meant that I could trust his courtship
from the very beginning.

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.774
As queer and trans people,

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:41.745
we're so often excluded
from institutions and traditions.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.743
We create spaces outside of convention,

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:46.879
including the conventions of time.

00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:49.956
And in those 3,000 messages between us,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.218
we collapsed time;

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:52.401
we queered it;

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.187
we laid it all on the table.

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:55.247
(Laughter)

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.033
With no pretense at all.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:00.312
And this meant that we were able
to commit to each other

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:01.933
in a profoundly different way.

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:06.564
So often what we're told is this idea
of the "Golden Rule,"

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:10.029
that we should treat other people
the way we want to be treated.

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:11.409
But the problem with that

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.664
is that it assumes that we are
the standard for other people,

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:15.908
and we're not.

00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:19.422
We need to treat other people
the way they want to be treated,

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:21.215
which means we had to ask.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.902
I couldn't assume that the kind
of love that Tiq needed

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.888
was the same kind of love that I needed.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:30.080
So I asked him everything --
about his fears, his insecurities --

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:31.500
and we started from there.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.172
TM: I didn't know what
kind of love I needed.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:36.396
I had just come out of a year-long fog

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.542
of being rejected and utterly depleted.

00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:40.811
I had someone look me in my eyes

00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:44.274
and tell me that I was unworthy
of their love because I was trans.

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.596
And there's a culture of lovelessness

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.752
that we've created around
transgender people.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.728
It's reasoned, justified
and often signed into law.

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:54.767
And I was a heartbeat away
from internalizing that message,

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.333
that I wasn't worthy.

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.125
But Kim said that I was her ideal --

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.754
the heartbroken mess that I was.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:00.928
(Laughter)

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.006
KKM: He totally was my ideal.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.142
(Laughter)

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.490
In more ways than one.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.246
Both poets, writers, creatives

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.751
with a long history
of community work behind us,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.573
and big, huge dreams
of a family in front of us,

00:03:13.982 --> 00:03:15.714
we shared a lot of things in common,

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:17.582
but we were also incredibly different.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:20.178
I've been a lifelong traveler
and a bit of an orphan,

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:22.344
whereas he comes from a huge family,

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.205
and definitely stays grounded.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:27.284
I often kind of sum up
the differences in our strengths

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:28.866
by saying, "Keep me safe,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.330
and I'll keep you wild."

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:31.795
(Laughter)

00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:38.652
TM: We have marginalized identities
but we don't live marginalized lives.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.504
Being queer and trans is about creating
new ways of existing.

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:44.697
It's about loving people as they are,

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:46.573
not as they're supposed to be.

00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:48.574
Kim is unapologetically feminine

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:51.416
in a world that is often cruel and violent

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.723
to women who are
too proud and too freeing.

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:55.368
And I didn't enter into this union

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:58.897
under the auspices that she
was going to be my helper or my rib,

00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:00.663
but a fully complex --

00:04:00.687 --> 00:04:01.702
(Laughter)

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:04.020
KKM: Right? That's not right.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.740
TM: But a fully complex human being

00:04:05.764 --> 00:04:09.373
whose femininity wasn't for me
to rein in, control or critique.

00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:10.919
It's her brilliance,

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:12.587
the way she leads with compassion,

00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:14.756
and how she never loses
sight of her empathy.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.849
She has been my hero since day one.

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:20.488
(Applause)

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:25.303
KKM: Our relationship has always been
about setting each other free.

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:27.160
One of the first questions I asked him

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:29.355
was what dreams he had left to accomplish,

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.439
and how would I help him get there.

00:04:31.463 --> 00:04:33.407
His dreams to live as a poet,

00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:35.621
to adopt and raise a family together,

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:37.361
to live a life that he was proud of,

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.668
and one that would live up to
his mother's incredible legacy.

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:44.597
And I really appreciated that we
were able to start from that place,

00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.527
and not from a place
that was around figuring out

00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:49.696
how to make each other work together.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.293
And I think this really allowed us
to grow into the people that we were

00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:55.248
in a way that was incredibly different.

00:04:55.573 --> 00:04:57.358
I love him whole;

00:04:57.382 --> 00:04:59.805
pre-transition, now and in the future.

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:02.621
And it's this love that had us
committed to each other

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:05.353
before we'd even seen each other's faces.

00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:09.236
TM: My mother's biggest
concern when I transitioned

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.269
was who was going to love me as I am.

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:17.731
Had being transgender somehow
precluded me from love and monogamy

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:20.680
because I was supposedly
born in the wrong body?

00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:23.879
But it's this type of structuring
that has to be reframed

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.555
in order to let love in.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.472
My body never betrayed me,

00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:29.184
and my body was never wrong.

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:32.506
It's this restrictive,
binary thinking on gender

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.344
that said that I didn't exist.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.669
But when we met,

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:38.146
she loved me for exactly how I showed up.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.121
She would trace her fingers
along the numb keloid scars

00:05:41.145 --> 00:05:42.881
left by my top surgery.

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:46.921
Scars that run from the middle of my chest
all the way out to my outer torso.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:49.695
She said that these were
reminders of my strength

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.400
and everything that I went through

00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:53.202
and nothing for me to be ashamed of.

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.234
So sprinting towards her hand in marriage

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.184
was the queerest thing that I could do.

00:05:57.208 --> 00:05:58.634
(Laughter)

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.767
It flew in the face of more
conventional trajectories

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:04.623
of love and relationships,

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:07.793
because God was never supposed
to bless a union for folks like us,

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.099
and the law was never
supposed to recognize it.

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:14.048
KKM: So on May 5, 2014,

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:17.153
just about three months
after meeting online,

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:21.757
we were married on the steps
of City Hall in Manhattan,

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:25.438
and it was beautiful
in every conceivable way.

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:29.104
It's safe to say that we
reimagined some traditions,

00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:31.942
but we also kept some old ones
that we worked in,

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:34.077
and we created something
that worked for us.

00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:39.401
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled
with wildflowers from Brooklyn --

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:43.534
also added in a little bit of lavender
and sage to keep us grounded

00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:45.265
because we were so nervous.

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.819
And it was put together by a sweet
sister healer friend of ours.

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.482
I never wanted a diamond ring,

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:52.974
because conflict and convention
are not my thing,

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:54.803
so my ring is the deepest purple,

00:06:54.827 --> 00:06:56.471
like the color of my crown chakra,

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:58.635
and set in place with my birthstones.

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.101
The gift of queerness is options.

00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:03.261
I never had to choose his last name,

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:04.907
it was never an exception,

00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:08.260
but I did because I am
my father's bastard child,

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:12.286
someone who has always been
an apology, a secret, an imposition.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.363
And it was incredibly freeing

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.176
to choose the name of a man
who chose me first.

00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:20.149
(Applause)

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:27.975
TM: So we told some family
and some close friends,

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:31.197
many of whom were still in disbelief
as we took our vows.

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:35.115
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding
photos on Facebook,

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:36.340
where we met --

00:07:36.364 --> 00:07:38.089
and Instagram, of course.

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:40.174
And we quickly realized

00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:43.396
that our coming together was more
than just a union of two people,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.402
but was a model of possibility
for the millions of LGBTQ folks

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:48.755
who have been sold this lie

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.708
that family and matrimony
is antithetical to who they are --

00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.462
for those of us
who rarely get to see ourselves

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.087
reflected in love and happiness.

00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:57.589
KKM: And the thing is,

00:07:57.613 --> 00:08:00.335
absolutely we are marginalized
because of our identities,

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:03.694
but it also emboldens us
to be the people that we are.

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.949
Queerness is our major key;

00:08:05.973 --> 00:08:07.875
blackness is our magic.

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:09.495
It's because of these things

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:14.276
that we are able to be hopeful, open,
receptive and shape-shifting.

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:16.499
These are the things that give us,

00:08:16.523 --> 00:08:19.135
and are such an incredible
source of, our strength.

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:21.427
Our queerness is a source
of that strength.

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:24.561
I think of the words of Ottawa-based
poet Brandon Wint:

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:29.166
"Not queer like gay;
queer like escaping definition.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.332
Queer like some sort of fluidity
and limitlessness all at once.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.698
Queer like a freedom
too strange to be conquered.

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:39.989
Queer like the fearlessness
to imagine what love can look like,

00:08:40.013 --> 00:08:41.291
and to pursue it."

00:08:42.114 --> 00:08:44.393
TM: We are part of a community of folks --

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:45.589
Yeah, that's good right?

00:08:45.613 --> 00:08:47.191
(Laughter)

00:08:48.843 --> 00:08:52.633
We are part of a community of folks
who are living their authentic selves

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.672
all along the gender spectrum,

00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:57.200
despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,

00:08:57.224 --> 00:09:00.257
despite the undercurrent of anxiety
that always is present

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:02.549
for people who live on their own terms.

00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:06.548
Globally, a transgender person
is murdered every 21 hours.

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:13.752
And the United States has had more
trans murders on record this year

00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:15.193
than any year to date.

00:09:15.217 --> 00:09:19.282
However, our stories are much more
than this rigid dichotomy

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:20.758
of strength and resilience.

00:09:20.782 --> 00:09:24.899
We are expanding the human
complexity on these margins,

00:09:24.923 --> 00:09:27.673
and we are creating freedom
on these margins.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:30.484
KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.

00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:34.362
We're creating a world
that we have literally never seen before;

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:38.007
organizing families based
on love and not by blood,

00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:41.983
guiding by a compassion that so few of us
have been shown ourselves.

00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:46.507
So many of us have not received
love from our families --

00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:49.350
have been betrayed by the people
that we trust most.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.021
So what we do here is we create
entirely new languages of love.

00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:58.874
Ones that are about creating the space
for us to be our authentic selves

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.944
and not imposing this standard

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.869
of what masculinity or femininity
is supposed to be.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:07.015
TM: We are interested
in love and inclusion

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.687
as a tool of revolutionary change, right?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.754
And the idea is simply,

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.904
if we drop all our preconceived notions

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:15.988
about how somebody is supposed to be --

00:10:16.012 --> 00:10:19.187
in their body, in their
gender, in their skin --

00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:22.967
if we take the intentional steps
to unlearn these deep-seated biases

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:25.583
and create space for people
to be self-determined,

00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:26.935
and embrace who they are,

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.730
then we will definitely create a better
world than the one we were born into.

00:10:30.754 --> 00:10:32.372
(Applause)

00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.956
KKM: We want to mark this time in history

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.748
by leaving evidence of the fact
that we were here.

00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:46.132
We open up little windows
into our relationship

00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:47.829
for our community to bear witness,

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:50.880
and we do this because we want
to make maps to the future

00:10:50.904 --> 00:10:52.886
and not monuments to ourselves.

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:57.253
Our experience does not invalidate
other peoples' experience,

00:10:57.277 --> 00:11:00.857
but it should and necessarily does
complicate this idea

00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:03.561
of what love and marriage
are supposed to be.

00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:06.667
TM: OK, now for all the talking,

00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:08.131
and inspiring,

00:11:08.155 --> 00:11:09.887
and possibility-modeling we've done,

00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:11.636
we've been nowhere near perfect.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.937
And we've had to hold
a mirror up to ourselves.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.135
And I saw that I wasn't
always the best listener,

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.444
and that my ego got in the way
of our progress as a couple.

00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:23.836
And I've had to really assess
these deep-seated, sexist ideas

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.161
that I've had about the value
of a woman's experience in the world.

00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:30.619
I've had to reevaluate what it means
to be in allyship with my wife.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.795
KKM: And I had to remind myself
of a lot of things, too.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.803
What it means to be hard on the issues,

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:38.579
but soft on the person.

00:11:38.603 --> 00:11:42.035
While we were writing this,
we got into a massive fight.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.236
(Laughter)

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:47.724
For so many different reasons,

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:52.079
but based on the content about our values
and our lived experiences --

00:11:52.103 --> 00:11:53.851
and we were really hurt, you know?

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:58.925
Because what we do and how we love
puts ourselves entirely on the line.

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:02.928
But even though the fight lasted
over the course of two days --

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:04.241
(Laughter)

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.084
We were able to come back
together to each other,

00:12:07.108 --> 00:12:11.261
and recommit to ourselves,
to each other and to our marriage.

00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:14.006
And that really yielded
some of the most passionate parts

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.944
of what we share with you here today.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.676
TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.480
which I think doesn't happen enough.

00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:22.713
I've had to interrogate masculinity;

00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:26.630
the toxic privileges that come
with being a man don't define me,

00:12:26.654 --> 00:12:29.970
but I have to be accountable
for how it shows up in my life every day.

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:33.851
I have allowed my wife
to do all of the emotional labor

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:38.113
of prying open the lines of communication
when I'd rather clam up and run away.

00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:39.264
(Laughter)

00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:43.537
I've stripped away emotional support
instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,

00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:46.976
particularly around the heartbreaking
miscarriage we suffered last year,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.363
and I'm sorry for that.

00:12:48.888 --> 00:12:51.370
Sometimes as men,
we get to take the easy way out.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.197
And so my journey as a trans person
is about reimagining masculinity.

00:12:56.838 --> 00:12:59.353
About creating a manhood
that isn't measured

00:12:59.377 --> 00:13:02.921
by the power it wields,
by the entitlements afforded to it,

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:05.450
or any simulacrum of control
that it can muster,

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.292
but works in tandem with femininity,

00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:08.986
and is guided by my spirit.

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:12.075
KKM: Y'all ...

00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:14.284
(Applause)

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:19.911
And this has created the space
for my femininity to flourish

00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:23.140
in a way I had never experienced before.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:27.692
He never is threatened by my sexuality,

00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:30.879
he never polices what I wear or how I act.

00:13:31.696 --> 00:13:34.890
I cook but he does way more
of the cleaning than I do.

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:37.106
And when we're rushing
to get out of the house

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.632
and we have so much to handle,

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:40.249
he handles everything,

00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:42.460
so I have time to do my hair and makeup.

00:13:42.484 --> 00:13:43.634
(Laughter)

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:46.730
He understands that this is my armor,

00:13:46.754 --> 00:13:51.263
and he never treats femininity
as though it is frivolous or superficial,

00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:53.103
and this, and him --

00:13:53.127 --> 00:13:56.447
he grows my experience
of gender every single day.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.323
TM: I love to watch her
get dressed in the morning.

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:01.237
Watching her in the closet,

00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:04.146
looking for something comfortable
and colorful, and tight,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.602
and safe --

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:06.776
(Laughter)

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:09.887
But it's challenging to watch her
negotiate her decisions

00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:13.399
looking for something that's going
to get the least amount of attention,

00:14:13.423 --> 00:14:17.044
but at the same time be an expression
of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.

00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:19.806
And all I want to do is celebrate
her for her beauty,

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.727
and the things that make her
beautiful and special and free,

00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:24.202
from her long acrylic nails,

00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:26.246
to her uncompromising black feminism.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.936
(Applause)

00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:32.966
KKM: I love you. TM: I love you.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.140
(Laughter)

00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:37.032
KKM: There are so many queer
and trans people

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:38.449
who have come before us,

00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:41.168
whose stories we will never get to hear.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.823
We constantly experience
this retelling of history

00:14:44.847 --> 00:14:46.983
where we are conspicuously left out.

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:50.372
And it's really hard
to not see ourselves there.

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:54.370
And so living out loud for us
is about that representation.

00:14:54.798 --> 00:14:57.117
It's about having possibility models,

00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:01.002
and having hope that love is part
of our inheritance in this world, too.

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:03.798
TM: The possibility that we are practicing

00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:06.669
is about reinventing time,
love and institutions.

00:15:07.093 --> 00:15:09.332
We are creating a future of multiplicity.

00:15:09.724 --> 00:15:12.799
We are expanding the spectrum
of gender and sexuality,

00:15:12.823 --> 00:15:14.712
imagining ourselves into existence,

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:18.771
imagining a world where gender
is self-determined and not imposed,

00:15:18.795 --> 00:15:21.712
and where who we are
is a kaleidoscope of possibility

00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:26.115
without the narrow-minded limitations
masquerading as science or justice.

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:28.915
(Applause)

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.185
KKM: And I can't lie:

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:35.265
it is really, really hard.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.336
It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.725
with an open heart and a smile on my face.

00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:43.980
It is really hard to face the injustice
that exists in the world,

00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:48.034
while still believing in the ability
of people to really change.

00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.659
That takes an enormous amount
of faith and dedication.

00:15:52.058 --> 00:15:53.344
And beyond that,

00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:55.477
marriage is hard work.

00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:56.652
(Laughter)

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:59.244
Piles of dirty socks on the floor,

00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:03.029
more boring sports shows
than I ever thought possible --

00:16:03.053 --> 00:16:04.308
(Laughter)

00:16:04.743 --> 00:16:06.487
And fights that bring me to tears

00:16:06.511 --> 00:16:09.376
when it feels like we're not
speaking the same language.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.519
But there is not a day that goes by

00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:14.776
where I am not so grateful
to be married to this man;

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.626
where I'm not so grateful for
the possibility of changing minds,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.192
and rewarding conversations,

00:16:20.216 --> 00:16:23.196
and creating a world
where love belongs to us all.

00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:25.115
I think about our acronym:

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:29.110
LGBTQ2SIA.

00:16:31.145 --> 00:16:34.798
A seemingly endless evolution
of self and a community,

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:38.857
but also this really deep desire
not to leave anyone behind.

00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:41.387
We've learned how to love each other,

00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:45.250
and we've committed to loving each other
throughout changes to gender

00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:46.842
and changes in spirit.

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:49.942
And we learned this love
in our chat rooms,

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:53.646
in our clubs, in our bars
and in our community centers.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.404
We've learned how to love
each other for the long haul.

00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:58.104
TM &amp; KKM: Thank you.

00:16:58.128 --> 00:17:01.228
(Applause)
