00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
One of my favorite parts

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
of my job at the Gates Foundation

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
is that I get to travel to the developing world,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
and I do that quite regularly.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
And when I meet the mothers

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
in so many of these remote places,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
I'm really struck by the things

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
that we have in common.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
They want what we want for our children

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
and that is for their children to grow up successful,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
But I also see lots of poverty,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
and it's quite jarring,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
both in the scale and the scope of it.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
where they had dirt floors, no running water,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
no electricity,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
and that's really what I see all over the world.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
So in short, I'm startled by all the things

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
that they don't have.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Coca-Cola.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Coke is everywhere.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
In fact, when I travel to the developing world,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Coke feels ubiquitous.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
And so when I come back from these trips,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and I'm thinking about development,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
how is it that they can get Coke

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
to these far-flung places?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
If they can do that,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
But I think, as a community,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
we still have a lot to learn.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
They sell 1.5 billion servings

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
every single day.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
having a serving of Coke every week.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
So why does this matter?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
and go even faster

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
we need to learn from the innovators,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
and those innovators

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
come from every single sector.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I feel that, if we can understand

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260
we can apply those lessons then for the public good.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Coke's success is relevant,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
because if we can analyze it, learn from it,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
then we can save lives.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
And I think there are really three things

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
we can take away from Coca-Cola.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
They take real-time data

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
and immediately feed it back into the product.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
and they do incredible marketing.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
So let's start with the data.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So they take the data,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
and they use it to measure progress.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
They have this very continuous feedback loop.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
They learn something, they put it back into the product,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
they put it back into the market.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
It's a lot like other consumer companies.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
and you have a 107 constituencies,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
you know where every can versus bottle

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
whether it was a corner store,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
a supermarket or a pushcart.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
So if sales start to drop,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
then the person can identify the problem

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
and address the issue.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.260
In development, the evaluation comes

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
at the very end of the project.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
I've sat in a lot of those meetings,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
and by then,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
it is way too late to use the data.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
I had somebody from an NGO

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and then you an see your impact."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Real-time data

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.260
turns on the lights.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
They're good at tapping into

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
that local entrepreneurial talent.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Coke's been in Africa since 1928,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
which was a large truck rolling down the street.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And in Africa, the remote places,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
it's hard to find a good road.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
But Coke noticed something --

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
And they decided in 1990

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
giving them small loans.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.260
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.260
who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
to sell the product.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.260
There are now some 3,000 of these centers

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.260
employing about 15,000 people in Africa.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
In Tanzania and Uganda,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
they represent 90 percent

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
of Coke's sales.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
Let's look at the development side.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
What is it that governments and NGOs

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260
can learn from Coke?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Governments and NGOs

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
because the locals know how to reach

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260
the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.260
and they know what motivates them to make change.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
I think a great example of this

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
is Ethiopia's new health extension program.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
The government noticed in Ethiopia

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
forget it, to get to the health care center.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
They decided that wasn't good enough,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
that also had a system like this,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
and they adapted it for Ethiopia.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.260
started this new system in their own country.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.260
They trained 35,000 health extension workers

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
to deliver care directly to the people.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
In just five years,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.260
their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.260
to one worker for every 2,500 people.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
Now, think about

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
how this can change people's lives.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.260
Health extension workers can help with so many things,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
whether it's family planning, prenatal care,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
immunizations for the children,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
or advising the woman to get to the facility on time

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
for an on-time delivery.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
That is having real impact

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
in a country like Ethiopia,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
and it's why you see their child mortality numbers

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
coming down 25 percent

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
from 2000 to 2008.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.260
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260
because of this health extension worker program.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
Well, they're already starting talk about this.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
generate their own ideas?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.260
out in those remote villages?"

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.260
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.260
and you unlock people's potential.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
The third component of Coke's success

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
is marketing.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Ultimately, Coke's success

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
depends on one crucial fact

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
and that is that people want

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
a Coca-Cola.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
can sell or make a profit

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.260
So, they rely on Coca-Cola

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.260
in terms of its marketing,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
and what's the secret to their marketing?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Well, it's aspirational.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
It is associated that product

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
with a kind of life that people want to live.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
So even though it's a global company,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.260
they take a very local approach.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
Coke's global campaign slogan

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
is "Open Happiness."

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
But they localize it.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
And they don't just guess what makes people happy;

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
they go to places like Latin America

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.260
and they realize that happiness there

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
is associated with family life.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
And in South Africa,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
they associate happiness

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.260
with seriti or community respect.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.260
(Video) K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.260
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.260
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.260
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.260
♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.260

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.260

♫ Every nation, all around us ♫

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Well, they didn't stop there --

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
they localized it into 18 different languages.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
And it went number one on the pop chart

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
in 17 countries.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
that also went number one on the pop charts.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Both songs have something in common:

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.260
that same appeal

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.260
of celebration and unity.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.260
So how does health and development market?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
Well, it's based on avoidance,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
not aspirations.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.260
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.260
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And I think we make a fundamental mistake --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
we make an assumption,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
that we think that, if people need something,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.260
we don't have to make them want that.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
And I think that's a mistake.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.260
One example is sanitation.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
We know that a million and a half children

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
die a year from diarrhea

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260
and a lot of it is because of open defecation.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.260
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
it doesn't get used.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
People reuse it for a slab for their home.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
They sometimes store grain in it.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
(Laughter)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260
But what does marketing really entail

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.260
that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260
Well, you work with the community.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.260
You start to talk to them about why open defecation

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
is something that shouldn't be done in the village,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
and they agree to that.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.260
But then you take the toilet and you position it

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.260
as a modern, trendy convenience.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
One state in Northern India has gone so far

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
as to link toilets to courtship.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And it works -- look at these headlines.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.260
(Laughter)

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
I'm not kidding.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
No loo, no "I do."

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.260
(Laughter)

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260
Now, it's not just a funny headline --

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.260
it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
But more importantly,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
it saves lives.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Take a look at this --

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
this is a room full of young men

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
and my husband, Bill.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
They're waiting to be circumcised.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Can you you believe that?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
by 60 percent in men.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.260
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.260
I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
But it turns out the men do,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
because they're hearing from their girlfriends

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
that they prefer it,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and the men also believe it improves their sex life.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
So if we can start to understand

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
what people really want

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
in health and development,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
we can change communities

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.260
and we can change whole nations.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
Well, why is all of this so important?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.260
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
when you tie the three things together.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.260
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.260
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
So if you look back to 1988,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
there are about 350,000 cases of polio

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
on the planet that year.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
Well how did that happen?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
Let's look at a country like India.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
They have over a billion people in this country,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.260
but they have 35,000 local doctors

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.260
who report paralysis,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.260
and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
They have two and a half million vaccinators.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
Let me tell you the story of Shriram,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
an 18 month boy in Bihar,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
a northern state in India.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.260
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.260
and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
and by the 25th of August,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.260
it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260
By August 30th, a genetic test was done,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.260
and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Now it could have come from one of two places.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.260
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
Luckily, the genetic testing proved

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
that, in fact, this strand came north,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
because, had it come from the south,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
So many more people would have been affected.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
So what's the endgame?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
which is what you do in polio.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
They went out and where Shriram lives,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
they vaccinated two million people.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
So in less than a month,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
we went from one case of paralysis

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
to a targeted vaccination program.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.260
That's how you keep

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260
a huge outbreak from spreading,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
and it shows what can happen

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.260
when local people have the data in their hands;

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.260
they can save lives.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.260
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
but it might not be what you think.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
It's not the marketing on the ground.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260
It's not telling the parents,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.260
"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
or get your child vaccinated."

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.260
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
over the last 20 years,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and that is that the donor nations

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
aren't willing to fund polio any longer.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
So we are 99 percent

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
of the way there on this goal

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260
and we're about to run short of money.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260
if we could focus as a community

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
on how far we've come

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.260
and how amazing it would be

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260
to eradicate this disease,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260
we could put polio fatigue

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and polio behind us.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
And if we could do that,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
in all of our countries for polio.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
And it would only be the second disease ever

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
wiped off the face of the planet.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
And we are so close.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.260
And this victory is so possible.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.260
So if Coke's marketers came to me

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260
and asked me to define happiness,

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.260
I'd say my vision of happiness

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.260
is a mother holding healthy baby

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.260
in her arms.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.260
To me, that is deep happiness.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
then in the future we make together,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
that happiness

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
can be just as ubiquitous

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260
as Coca-Cola.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
Thank you.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:22.260
(Applause)
