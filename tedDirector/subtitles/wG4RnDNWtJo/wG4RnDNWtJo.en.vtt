00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.975
Over a million people are killed
each year in disasters.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:23.233
Two and a half million people
will be permanently disabled or displaced,

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:27.181
and the communities will take
20 to 30 years to recover

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:29.606
and billions of economic losses.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:35.425
If you can reduce
the initial response by one day,

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.976
you can reduce the overall recovery

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.808
by a thousand days, or three years.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:43.585
See how that works?

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.459
If the initial responders
can get in, save lives,

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.999
mitigate whatever flooding
danger there is,

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:51.307
that means the other groups can get in

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.316
to restore the water,
the roads, the electricity,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.456
which means then the construction people,
the insurance agents,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.094
all of them can get in
to rebuild the houses,

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:03.106
which then means
you can restore the economy,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.003
and maybe even make it better
and more resilient to the next disaster.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.695
A major insurance company told me

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.831
that if they can get a homeowner's claim
processed one day earlier,

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:18.975
it'll make a difference of six months

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.239
in that person getting
their home repaired.

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:24.447
And that's why I do disaster robotics --

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.970
because robots can
make a disaster go away faster.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.322
Now, you've already seen
a couple of these.

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.066
These are the UAVs.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.951
These are two types of UAVs:

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:37.840
a rotorcraft, or hummingbird;

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.934
a fixed-wing, a hawk.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.348
And they're used extensively since 2005 --

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:44.547
Hurricane Katrina.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.895
Let me show you how this hummingbird,
this rotorcraft, works.

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.975
Fantastic for structural engineers.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.419
Being able to see damage from angles you
can't get from binoculars on the ground

00:01:55.443 --> 00:01:56.753
or from a satellite image,

00:01:56.777 --> 00:01:59.969
or anything flying at a higher angle.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.902
But it's not just structural engineers
and insurance people who need this.

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:07.393
You've got things
like this fixed-wing, this hawk.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:10.688
Now, this hawk can be used
for geospatial surveys.

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:13.561
That's where you're
pulling imagery together

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:15.410
and getting 3D reconstruction.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:19.508
We used both of these at the Oso mudslides
up in Washington State,

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:21.731
because the big problem

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.913
was geospatial and hydrological
understanding of the disaster --

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.183
not the search and rescue.

00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:28.526
The search and rescue teams
had it under control

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.028
and knew what they were doing.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:33.922
The bigger problem was that river
and mudslide might wipe them out

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.440
and flood the responders.

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:39.206
And not only was it challenging
to the responders and property damage,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.509
it's also putting at risk
the future of salmon fishing

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.249
along that part of Washington State.

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:46.749
So they needed to understand
what was going on.

00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:49.382
In seven hours, going from Arlington,

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:54.220
driving from the Incident Command Post
to the site, flying the UAVs,

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:57.975
processing the data, driving back
to Arlington command post --

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.405
seven hours.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.963
We gave them in seven hours
data that they could take

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:06.737
only two to three days
to get any other way --

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.598
and at higher resolution.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.437
It's a game changer.

00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:13.842
And don't just think about the UAVs.

00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:16.494
I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,

00:03:16.518 --> 00:03:19.854
80 percent of the world's
population lives by water,

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:22.742
and that means our critical
infrastructure is underwater --

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:26.052
the parts that we can't get to,
like the bridges and things like that.

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.668
And that's why we have
unmanned marine vehicles,

00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:33.144
one type of which you've already met,
which is SARbot, a square dolphin.

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.864
It goes underwater and uses sonar.

00:03:35.888 --> 00:03:38.221
Well, why are marine vehicles so important

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:41.369
and why are they very, very important?

00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:42.909
They get overlooked.

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:45.335
Think about the Japanese tsunami --

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.325
400 miles of coastland totally devastated,

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.045
twice the amount of coastland devastated
by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.925
You're talking about your bridges,
your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.561
And if you don't have a port,

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.831
you don't have a way
to get in enough relief supplies

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:04.076
to support a population.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.672
That was a huge problem
at the Haiti earthquake.

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:09.687
So we need marine vehicles.

00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:12.142
Now, let's look at a viewpoint
from the SARbot

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:13.637
of what they were seeing.

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.907
We were working on a fishing port.

00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:21.647
We were able to reopen that fishing port,
using her sonar, in four hours.

00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.324
That fishing port was told
it was going to be six months

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.054
before they could get
a manual team of divers in,

00:04:27.078 --> 00:04:29.765
and it was going to take
the divers two weeks.

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.083
They were going to miss
the fall fishing season,

00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:36.333
which was the major economy for that part,
which is kind of like their Cape Cod.

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.625
UMVs, very important.

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:41.897
But you know, all the robots
I've shown you have been small,

00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:45.698
and that's because robots
don't do things that people do.

00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:47.975
They go places people can't go.

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.975
And a great example of that is Bujold.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.975
Unmanned ground vehicles
are particularly small,

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.317
so Bujold --

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:56.849
(Laughter)

00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:58.056
Say hello to Bujold.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.764
(Laughter)

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:04.975
Bujold was used extensively
at the World Trade Center

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.379
to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.048
You're climbing into the rubble,
rappelling down, going deep in spaces.

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:16.631
And just to see the World Trade Center
from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:21.724
You're talking about a disaster
where you can't fit a person or a dog --

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:23.890
and it's on fire.

00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:27.648
The only hope of getting
to a survivor way in the basement,

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:29.867
you have to go through things
that are on fire.

00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:34.395
It was so hot, on one of the robots,
the tracks began to melt and come off.

00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:37.949
Robots don't replace people or dogs,

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:40.494
or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.

00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:42.554
They do things new.

00:05:42.578 --> 00:05:48.267
They assist the responders,
the experts, in new and innovative ways.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:52.720
The biggest problem is not
making the robots smaller, though.

00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:54.975
It's not making them more heat-resistant.

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.756
It's not making more sensors.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.390
The biggest problem is the data,
the informatics,

00:06:00.414 --> 00:06:04.450
because these people need to get
the right data at the right time.

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:09.975
So wouldn't it be great if we could have
experts immediately access the robots

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.975
without having to waste any time
of driving to the site,

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.932
so whoever's there,
use their robots over the Internet.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:17.338
Well, let's think about that.

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:20.734
Let's think about a chemical
train derailment in a rural county.

00:06:20.758 --> 00:06:24.600
What are the odds that the experts,
your chemical engineer,

00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:26.486
your railroad transportation engineers,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.371
have been trained on whatever UAV
that particular county happens to have?

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:32.928
Probably, like, none.

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:35.342
So we're using these kinds of interfaces

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:39.706
to allow people to use the robots
without knowing what robot they're using,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.516
or even if they're using a robot or not.

00:06:44.252 --> 00:06:50.286
What the robots give you,
what they give the experts, is data.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.890
The problem becomes:
who gets what data when?

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.807
One thing to do is to ship
all the information to everybody

00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:59.343
and let them sort it out.

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:03.223
Well, the problem with that
is it overwhelms the networks,

00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:06.933
and worse yet, it overwhelms
the cognitive abilities

00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:11.466
of each of the people trying to get
that one nugget of information

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.295
they need to make the decision
that's going to make the difference.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.093
So we need to think
about those kinds of challenges.

00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:20.382
So it's the data.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.642
Going back to the World Trade Center,

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:26.975
we tried to solve that problem
by just recording the data from Bujold

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.975
only when she was deep in the rubble,

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:31.563
because that's what the USAR team
said they wanted.

00:07:32.523 --> 00:07:35.111
What we didn't know at the time

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:37.733
was that the civil engineers
would have loved,

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:41.975
needed the data as we recorded
the box beams, the serial numbers,

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:44.618
the locations, as we went into the rubble.

00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:46.810
We lost valuable data.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.213
So the challenge is getting all the data

00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:51.417
and getting it to the right people.

00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:53.518
Now, here's another reason.

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.853
We've learned that some buildings --

00:07:55.877 --> 00:07:59.149
things like schools,
hospitals, city halls --

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:03.192
get inspected four times
by different agencies

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.466
throughout the response phases.

00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:09.425
Now, we're looking, if we can get
the data from the robots to share,

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:14.299
not only can we do things like
compress that sequence of phases

00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:15.976
to shorten the response time,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.358
but now we can begin
to do the response in parallel.

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:21.761
Everybody can see the data.

00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:23.247
We can shorten it that way.

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:27.405
So really, "disaster robotics"
is a misnomer.

00:08:28.227 --> 00:08:30.122
It's not about the robots.

00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:32.028
It's about the data.

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:35.763
(Applause)

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:37.744
So my challenge to you:

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:40.068
the next time you hear about a disaster,

00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:41.417
look for the robots.

00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:44.566
They may be underground,
they may be underwater,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.284
they may be in the sky,

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:48.273
but they should be there.

00:08:48.297 --> 00:08:49.464
Look for the robots,

00:08:49.488 --> 00:08:52.235
because robots are coming to the rescue.

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:57.920
(Applause)
