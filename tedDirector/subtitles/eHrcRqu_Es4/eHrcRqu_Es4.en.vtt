00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:18.944
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:22.654
about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.

00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:25.373
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:28.885
of what a 404 page actually is.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.991
The 404 page is that.

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.331
It's that broken experience on the Web.

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.642
It's effectively the default page

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:40.218
when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:42.518
And it serves you the 404 page.

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:47.343
It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:49.968
And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself,

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:53.010
it's annoying when you hit this thing.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.268
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:58.010
And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.885
where does 404 come from?

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:01.929
It's from a family of errors actually --

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.039
a whole set of relationship errors,

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.343
which, when I started digging into them,

00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:11.177
it looks almost like a checklist
for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:14.302
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:17.191
(Laughter)

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.218
Yes.

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.462
But these things are everywhere.

00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:24.158
They're on sites big, they're on sites small.

00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:26.843
This is a global experience.

00:01:26.843 --> 00:01:29.720
What a 404 page tells you

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.877
is that you fell through the cracks.

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:35.635
And that's not a good experience

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.079
when you're used to experiences like this.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.352
You can get on your Kinect

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:41.510
and you can have unicorns dancing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.147
and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.237
A 404 page is not what you're looking for.

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:49.689
You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.922
Trying to think about how a 404 felt,

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:53.802
and it would be like if you went to Starbucks

00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:55.552
and there's the guy behind the counter

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.364
and you're over there and there's no skim milk.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.343
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:01.508
And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.

00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:04.450
And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.539
That's the 404 feeling.

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:08.212
(Laughter)

00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:10.468
I mean, I've heard about that.

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:14.606
So where this comes into play and why this is important

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:15.937
is I head up a technology incubator,

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:17.937
and we had eight startups sitting around there.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.973
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not,

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:22.769
until one day Athletepath,

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.447
which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes,

00:02:26.447 --> 00:02:27.885
found this video.

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:31.450
(Video) Guy: Joey!

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.254
Crowd: Whoa!

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:39.635
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.678
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:46.510
and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.218
Because finally there was a page

00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:52.419
that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.945
(Laughter)

00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:55.726
(Applause)

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:58.093
So this turned into a contest.

00:02:58.093 --> 00:03:00.343
Dailypath that offers inspiration

00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:02.839
put inspiration on their 404 page.

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:06.755
Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network,

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:08.575
commiserated with your pet.

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:09.968
Each one of them found this.

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.218
It turned into a 24-hour contest.

00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:14.343
At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.

00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:15.760
And what they learned

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.144
was that those little things, done right, actually matter,

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:20.790
and that well-designed moments can build brands.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.718
So you take a look out in the real world,

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.160
and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.091
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.089
This is one that commiserates with you.

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.839
This is one that blames you.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.677
This is one that I loved.

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:36.010
This is an error page,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.056
but what if this error page was also an opportunity?

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:42.222
So it was a moment in time

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.493
where all of these startups had to sit and think

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:46.815
and got really excited about what they could be.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:49.412
Because back to the whole relationship issue,

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:51.669
what they figured out through this exercise

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.506
was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not,

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:57.825
or it can remind me of why I should love you.

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.583
Thank you.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.173
(Applause)
