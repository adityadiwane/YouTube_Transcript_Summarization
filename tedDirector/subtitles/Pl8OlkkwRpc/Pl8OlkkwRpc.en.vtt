00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:16.277
The technology likely to have
the greatest impact

00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:18.047
on the next few decades

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:19.323
has arrived.

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.241
And it's not social media.

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:23.662
It's not big data.

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.193
It's not robotics.

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.700
It's not even AI.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.399
You'll be surprised to learn

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:34.135
that it's the underlying technology
of digital currencies like Bitcoin.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.560
It's called the blockchain. Blockchain.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:41.173
Now, it's not the most sonorous
word in the world,

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:44.710
but I believe that this is now

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.275
the next generation of the internet,

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.874
and that it holds vast promise
for every business, every society

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:53.565
and for all of you, individually.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:59.042
You know, for the past few decades,
we've had the internet of information.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.287
And when I send you an email
or a PowerPoint file or something,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.385
I'm actually not sending you the original,

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:06.772
I'm sending you a copy.

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:08.739
And that's great.

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:11.219
This is democratized information.

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.199
But when it comes to assets --

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:17.568
things like money,

00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:20.047
financial assets like stocks and bonds,

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.506
loyalty points, intellectual property,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.059
music, art, a vote,

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.587
carbon credit and other assets --

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.223
sending you a copy is a really bad idea.

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:34.042
If I send you 100 dollars,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.103
it's really important
that I don't still have the money --

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:38.134
(Laughter)

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.516
and that I can't send it to you.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.877
This has been called
the "double-spend" problem

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:44.995
by cryptographers for a long time.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.738
So today, we rely entirely
on big intermediaries --

00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:53.015
middlemen like banks, government,

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.603
big social media companies,
credit card companies and so on --

00:01:56.627 --> 00:01:59.269
to establish trust in our economy.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:04.873
And these intermediaries perform
all the business and transaction logic

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:06.293
of every kind of commerce,

00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:08.978
from authentication,
identification of people,

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:13.067
through to clearing, settling
and record keeping.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.504
And overall, they do a pretty good job.

00:02:15.528 --> 00:02:17.225
But there are growing problems.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.474
To begin, they're centralized.

00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:22.466
That means they can be hacked,
and increasingly are --

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.049
JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,

00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:26.864
LinkedIn, Home Depot and others

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:28.303
found that out the hard way.

00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:32.388
They exclude billions of people
from the global economy,

00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:34.665
for example, people
who don't have enough money

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.949
to have a bank account.

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.912
They slow things down.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:42.506
It can take a second for an email
to go around the world,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.954
but it can take days or weeks

00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:48.110
for money to move through
the banking system across a city.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.333
And they take a big piece of the action --

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:53.387
10 to 20 percent just to send money
to another country.

00:02:54.022 --> 00:02:55.663
They capture our data,

00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:57.639
and that means we can't monetize it

00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:00.417
or use it to better manage our lives.

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:03.178
Our privacy is being undermined.

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:05.426
And the biggest problem is that overall,

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:11.886
they've appropriated the largesse
of the digital age asymmetrically:

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.144
we have wealth creation,
but we have growing social inequality.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:21.447
So what if there were not only
an internet of information,

00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.938
what if there were an internet of value --

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:28.645
some kind of vast, global,
distributed ledger

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.807
running on millions of computers

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.915
and available to everybody.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.790
And where every kind of asset,
from money to music,

00:03:36.814 --> 00:03:42.518
could be stored, moved, transacted,
exchanged and managed,

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:45.078
all without powerful intermediaries?

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:49.184
What if there were
a native medium for value?

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:54.914
Well, in 2008, the financial
industry crashed

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:57.522
and, perhaps propitiously,

00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:02.480
an anonymous person or persons
named Satoshi Nakamoto

00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:10.311
created a paper where he developed
a protocol for a digital cash

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:13.628
that used an underlying
cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:20.239
And this cryptocurrency enabled people
to establish trust and do transactions

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:21.954
without a third party.

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:25.714
And this seemingly simple act
set off a spark

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:27.885
that ignited the world,

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:33.052
that has everyone excited
or terrified or otherwise interested

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:34.321
in many places.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.710
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.909
Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.945
and that should be of interest
to you if you're a speculator.

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:45.930
More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.

00:04:45.954 --> 00:04:49.303
It's not a fiat currency
controlled by a nation-state.

00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:50.974
And that's of greater interest.

00:04:51.412 --> 00:04:54.626
But the real pony here
is the underlying technology.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.481
It's called blockchain.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:01.092
So for the first time now
in human history,

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:03.594
people everywhere can trust each other

00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:06.219
and transact peer to peer.

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:11.241
And trust is established,
not by some big institution,

00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:14.321
but by collaboration, by cryptography

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:16.478
and by some clever code.

00:05:16.502 --> 00:05:19.500
And because trust is native
to the technology,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.587
I call this, "The Trust Protocol."

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:25.650
Now, you're probably wondering:
How does this thing work?

00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:26.894
Fair enough.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.445
Assets -- digital assets like money
to music and everything in between --

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.135
are not stored in a central place,

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.855
but they're distributed
across a global ledger,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.397
using the highest level of cryptography.

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:43.588
And when a transaction is conducted,

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:45.690
it's posted globally,

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:48.783
across millions and millions of computers.

00:05:49.508 --> 00:05:51.352
And out there, around the world,

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.670
is a group of people called "miners."

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:57.186
These are not young people,
they're Bitcoin miners.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.217
They have massive computing power
at their fingertips --

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:05.051
10 to 100 times bigger
than all of Google worldwide.

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.534
These miners do a lot of work.

00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:09.495
And every 10 minutes,

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.806
kind of like the heartbeat of a network,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.035
a block gets created

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.285
that has all the transactions
from the previous 10 minutes.

00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:22.849
Then the miners get to work,
trying to solve some tough problems.

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:24.195
And they compete:

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.530
the first miner to find out the truth
and to validate the block,

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.915
is rewarded in digital currency,

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.702
in the case of the Bitcoin
blockchain, with Bitcoin.

00:06:34.171 --> 00:06:36.331
And then -- this is the key part --

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:38.812
that block is linked to the previous block

00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:40.145
and the previous block

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.417
to create a chain of blocks.

00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:44.880
And every one is time-stamped,

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.102
kind of like with a digital waxed seal.

00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:49.781
So if I wanted to go and hack a block

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:53.640
and, say, pay you and you
with the same money,

00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:55.917
I'd have to hack that block,

00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.371
plus all the preceding blocks,

00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:00.789
the entire history of commerce
on that blockchain,

00:07:00.813 --> 00:07:04.304
not just on one computer
but across millions of computers,

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:06.107
simultaneously,

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:09.466
all using the highest
levels of encryption,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.580
in the light of the most powerful
computing resource in the world

00:07:12.604 --> 00:07:13.852
that's watching me.

00:07:13.876 --> 00:07:15.041
Tough to do.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.712
This is infinitely more secure

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:20.095
than the computer systems
that we have today.

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:22.703
Blockchain. That's how it works.

00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:25.583
So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.

00:07:25.607 --> 00:07:26.758
There are many.

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:31.676
The Ethereum blockchain was developed
by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.930
He's [22] years old,

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:38.172
and this blockchain
has some extraordinary capabilities.

00:07:38.196 --> 00:07:41.279
One of them is that you can
build smart contracts.

00:07:41.303 --> 00:07:43.271
It's kind of what it sounds like.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.858
It's a contract that self-executes,

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:50.749
and the contract handles the enforcement,
the management, performance

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:55.034
and payment -- the contract kind of has
a bank account, too, in a sense --

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.694
of agreements between people.

00:07:57.718 --> 00:08:00.432
And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:02.743
there are projects underway
to do everything

00:08:02.767 --> 00:08:05.929
from create a new replacement
for the stock market

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:07.776
to create a new model of democracy,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.903
where politicians
are accountable to citizens.

00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:14.387
(Applause)

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.490
So to understand what a radical change
this is going to bring,

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:20.807
let's look at one industry,
financial services.

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:22.602
Recognize this?

00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.976
Rube Goldberg machine.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.681
It's a ridiculously complicated machine
that does something really simple,

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:31.083
like crack an egg or shut a door.

00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:35.425
Well, it kind of reminds me
of the financial services industry,

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:36.615
honestly.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:39.544
I mean, you tap your card
in the corner store,

00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:42.819
and a bitstream goes through
a dozen companies,

00:08:42.843 --> 00:08:45.206
each with their own computer system,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.535
some of them being 1970s mainframes

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.351
older than many
of the people in this room,

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.154
and three days later, a settlement occurs.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.264
Well, with a blockchain
financial industry,

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:58.691
there would be no settlement,

00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:01.573
because the payment and the settlement
is the same activity,

00:09:01.597 --> 00:09:03.341
it's just a change in the ledger.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.300
So Wall Street and all around the world,

00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:09.587
the financial industry
is in a big upheaval about this,

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.762
wondering, can we be replaced,

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:14.749
or how do we embrace
this technology for success?

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:16.971
Now, why should you care?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.788
Well, let me describe some applications.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:23.416
Prosperity.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.448
The first era of the internet,

00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:26.813
the internet of information,

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:30.300
brought us wealth
but not shared prosperity,

00:09:30.324 --> 00:09:32.778
because social inequality is growing.

00:09:32.802 --> 00:09:36.785
And this is at the heart
of all of the anger and extremism

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:40.409
and protectionism and xenophobia and worse

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:43.015
that we're seeing growing
in the world today,

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.888
Brexit being the most recent case.

00:09:46.868 --> 00:09:52.611
So could we develop some new approaches
to this problem of inequality?

00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:56.384
Because the only approach today
is to redistribute wealth,

00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:58.588
tax people and spread it around more.

00:09:58.612 --> 00:10:01.048
Could we pre-distribute wealth?

00:10:01.686 --> 00:10:04.882
Could we change the way that wealth
gets created in the first place

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:07.076
by democratizing wealth creation,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.493
engaging more people in the economy,

00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:12.613
and then ensuring that they got
fair compensation?

00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:16.002
Let me describe five ways
that this can be done.

00:10:16.597 --> 00:10:18.023
Number one:

00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:23.276
Did you know that 70 percent
of the people in the world who have land

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.419
have a tenuous title to it?

00:10:25.863 --> 00:10:29.255
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,
some dictator comes to power,

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:32.871
he says, "I know you've got a piece
of paper that says you own your farm,

00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:36.550
but the government computer
says my friend owns your farm."

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:39.145
This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:41.516
and this problem exists everywhere.

00:10:42.214 --> 00:10:44.989
Hernando de Soto, the great
Latin American economist,

00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:47.157
says this is the number one
issue in the world

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.775
in terms of economic mobility,

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.940
more important than having a bank account,

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:53.597
because if you don't have
a valid title to your land,

00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:55.177
you can't borrow against it,

00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.223
and you can't plan for the future.

00:10:57.969 --> 00:11:01.309
So today, companies
are working with governments

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.776
to put land titles on a blockchain.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.100
And once it's there, this is immutable.

00:11:06.718 --> 00:11:07.964
You can't hack it.

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:11.468
This creates the conditions for prosperity

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:13.660
for potentially billions of people.

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:15.668
Secondly:

00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:18.529
a lot of writers talk about Uber

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.888
and Airbnb and TaskRabbit
and Lyft and so on

00:11:21.912 --> 00:11:24.208
as part of the sharing economy.

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:25.896
This is a very powerful idea,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.099
that peers can come together
and create and share wealth.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.123
My view is that ...

00:11:31.729 --> 00:11:35.724
these companies are not really sharing.

00:11:35.748 --> 00:11:39.855
In fact, they're successful
precisely because they don't share.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:43.051
They aggregate services together,
and they sell them.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.642
What if, rather than Airbnb
being a $25 billion corporation,

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:54.172
there was a distributed application
on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,

00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:58.230
and it was essentially owned
by all of the people

00:11:58.254 --> 00:11:59.986
who have a room to rent.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:03.145
And when someone wants to rent a room,

00:12:03.169 --> 00:12:07.311
they go onto the blockchain
database and all the criteria,

00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:09.842
they sift through, it helps
them find the right room,

00:12:09.866 --> 00:12:12.635
and then the blockchain helps
with the contracting,

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:14.531
it identifies the party,

00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:15.913
it handles the payments

00:12:15.937 --> 00:12:19.183
just through digital payments --
they're built into the system.

00:12:19.207 --> 00:12:20.738
And it even handles reputation,

00:12:20.762 --> 00:12:24.954
because if she rates a room
as a five-star room,

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:26.194
that room is there,

00:12:26.218 --> 00:12:28.445
and it's rated, and it's immutable.

00:12:29.043 --> 00:12:33.787
So, the big sharing-economy
disruptors in Silicon Valley

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.699
could be disrupted,

00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:38.337
and this would be good for prosperity.

00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:39.518
Number three:

00:12:40.403 --> 00:12:42.974
the biggest flow of funds
from the developed world

00:12:42.998 --> 00:12:44.284
to the developing world

00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:46.570
is not corporate investment,

00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:48.875
and it's not even foreign aid.

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.605
It's remittances.

00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:54.264
This is the global diaspora;

00:12:54.288 --> 00:12:56.645
people have left their ancestral lands,

00:12:56.669 --> 00:13:00.558
and they're sending money back
to their families at home.

00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:03.705
This is 600 billion dollars a year,
and it's growing,

00:13:03.729 --> 00:13:05.769
and these people are getting ripped off.

00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:09.169
Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.

00:13:09.864 --> 00:13:11.769
She lives in Toronto,

00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:16.557
and every month she goes
to the Western Union office

00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:18.120
with some cash

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:21.104
to send her remittances
to her mom in Manila.

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.728
It costs her around 10 percent;

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:25.992
the money takes four to seven
days to get there;

00:13:26.016 --> 00:13:28.180
her mom never knows
when it's going to arrive.

00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:30.738
It takes five hours
out of her week to do this.

00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:32.723
Six months ago,

00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:37.327
Analie Domingo used
a blockchain application called Abra.

00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:40.384
And from her mobile device,
she sent 300 bucks.

00:13:40.408 --> 00:13:42.888
It went directly
to her mom's mobile device

00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:44.796
without going through an intermediary.

00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:47.738
And then her mom
looked at her mobile device --

00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:51.551
it's kind of like an Uber interface,
there's Abra "tellers" moving around.

00:13:51.575 --> 00:13:54.313
She clicks on a teller
that's a five-star teller,

00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:55.722
who's seven minutes away.

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:59.346
The guy shows up at the door,
gives her Filipino pesos,

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.936
she puts them in her wallet.

00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:03.121
The whole thing took minutes,

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:05.008
and it cost her two percent.

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:09.120
This is a big opportunity for prosperity.

00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:13.856
Number four: the most powerful asset
of the digital age is data.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:17.942
And data is really a new asset class,

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:20.245
maybe bigger than previous asset classes,

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:23.230
like land under the agrarian economy,

00:14:23.254 --> 00:14:24.907
or an industrial plant,

00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:26.088
or even money.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.550
And all of you -- we -- create this data.

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:31.356
We create this asset,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.095
and we leave this trail
of digital crumbs behind us

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:35.949
as we go throughout life.

00:14:35.973 --> 00:14:38.793
And these crumbs are collected
into a mirror image of you,

00:14:38.817 --> 00:14:40.041
the virtual you.

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.152
And the virtual you may know
more about you than you do,

00:14:43.176 --> 00:14:45.807
because you can't remember
what you bought a year ago,

00:14:45.831 --> 00:14:48.470
or said a year ago,
or your exact location a year ago.

00:14:48.494 --> 00:14:51.271
And the virtual you is not owned by you --

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:52.762
that's the big problem.

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:55.997
So today, there are companies working

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:59.658
to create an identity in a black box,

00:14:59.682 --> 00:15:01.293
the virtual you owned by you.

00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:05.158
And this black box moves around with you

00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:07.172
as you travel throughout the world,

00:15:07.196 --> 00:15:09.266
and it's very, very stingy.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.345
It only gives away
the shred of information

00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:13.916
that's required to do something.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.229
A lot of transactions,

00:15:15.253 --> 00:15:17.726
the seller doesn't even need
to know who you are.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.218
They just need to know that they got paid.

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:24.690
And then this avatar
is sweeping up all of this data

00:15:24.714 --> 00:15:27.458
and enabling you to monetize it.

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.849
And this is a wonderful thing,

00:15:29.873 --> 00:15:33.064
because it can also help us
protect our privacy,

00:15:33.088 --> 00:15:36.900
and privacy is the foundation
of a free society.

00:15:36.924 --> 00:15:38.890
Let's get this asset that we create

00:15:38.914 --> 00:15:40.691
back under our control,

00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:42.723
where we can own our own identity

00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:44.518
and manage it responsibly.

00:15:45.817 --> 00:15:46.974
Finally --

00:15:46.998 --> 00:15:51.796
(Applause)

00:15:52.335 --> 00:15:53.831
Finally, number five:

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:57.117
there are a whole number
of creators of content

00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.348
who don't receive fair compensation,

00:15:59.372 --> 00:16:02.464
because the system
for intellectual property is broken.

00:16:02.488 --> 00:16:05.600
It was broken by the first era
of the internet.

00:16:05.624 --> 00:16:07.091
Take music.

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:10.864
Musicians are left with crumbs
at the end of the whole food chain.

00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:15.728
You know, if you were a songwriter,
25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,

00:16:15.752 --> 00:16:18.014
it got a million singles,

00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:21.559
you could get royalties
of around 45,000 dollars.

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.899
Today, you're a songwriter,
you write a hit song,

00:16:23.923 --> 00:16:25.376
it gets a million streams,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.170
you don't get 45k,

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:29.781
you get 36 dollars,

00:16:29.805 --> 00:16:31.752
enough to buy a nice pizza.

00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:34.099
So Imogen Heap,

00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.507
the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,

00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:40.502
is now putting music
on a blockchain ecosystem.

00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:42.375
She calls it "Mycelia."

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:46.505
And the music has
a smart contract surrounding it.

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:50.052
And the music protects
her intellectual property rights.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:51.589
You want to listen to the song?

00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:54.970
It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents
that flow into a digital account.

00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:57.692
You want to put the song
in your movie, that's different,

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.475
and the IP rights are all specified.

00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:01.762
You want to make a ringtone?
That's different.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.439
She describes that the song
becomes a business.

00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:08.272
It's out there on this platform
marketing itself,

00:17:08.296 --> 00:17:10.263
protecting the rights of the author,

00:17:10.287 --> 00:17:12.442
and because the song has a payment system

00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:13.928
in the sense of bank account,

00:17:13.952 --> 00:17:16.300
all the money flows back to the artist,

00:17:16.324 --> 00:17:18.559
and they control the industry,

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:20.995
rather than these powerful intermediaries.

00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:22.908
Now, this is --

00:17:22.932 --> 00:17:27.124
(Applause)

00:17:27.604 --> 00:17:29.301
This is not just songwriters,

00:17:29.325 --> 00:17:30.824
it's any creator of content,

00:17:30.848 --> 00:17:32.315
like art,

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:34.807
like inventions,

00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.792
scientific discoveries, journalists.

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:40.829
There are all kinds of people
who don't get fair compensation,

00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:42.323
and with blockchains,

00:17:42.347 --> 00:17:46.109
they're going to be able
to make it rain on the blockchain.

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:47.791
And that's a wonderful thing.

00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:53.368
So, these are five opportunities

00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:54.666
out of a dozen

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.991
to solve one problem, prosperity,

00:17:57.015 --> 00:18:00.063
which is one of countless problems

00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:02.118
that blockchains are applicable to.

00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:06.991
Now, technology doesn't create
prosperity, of course -- people do.

00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:11.382
But my case to you is that, once again,

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:15.342
the technology genie
has escaped from the bottle,

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:18.578
and it was summoned
by an unknown person or persons

00:18:18.602 --> 00:18:21.327
at this uncertain time in human history,

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:25.487
and it's giving us
another kick at the can,

00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:30.628
another opportunity to rewrite
the economic power grid

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.376
and the old order of things,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.796
and solve some of the world's most
difficult problems,

00:18:37.272 --> 00:18:38.661
if we will it.

00:18:39.915 --> 00:18:41.107
Thank you.

00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:46.554
(Applause)
