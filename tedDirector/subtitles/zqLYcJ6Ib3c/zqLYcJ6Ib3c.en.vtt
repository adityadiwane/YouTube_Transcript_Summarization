00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.616
Hello.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.576
My name is Matthew Williams,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.520
and I am a champion.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.376
I have won medals
in three different sports

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.136
and national games in Canada,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.656
competed at the international
level in basketball

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.736
and was proud to represent Canada

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.376
on the world stage.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.680
(Applause)

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.256
I train five days a week
for basketball and speed skating,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.656
work with top quality coaches

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.176
and mental performance consultants

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.240
to be at my best in my sport.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.576
By the way, all that
is through Special Olympics.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.896
Does that change the way you think of me

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.600
and my accomplishments?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.840
The world does not see
all people like me as champions.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.920
Not long ago, people like me
were shunned and hidden away.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.376
There has been lots of change
since Special Olympics began in 1968,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.536
but in too many cases,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.376
people with intellectual disabilities

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.640
are invisible to the wider population.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
People use the r-word in front of me,
and they think it doesn't matter.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.176
That's the word "retard" or "retarded"

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.480
used in a derogatory manner.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.160
They're not thinking about how much
it hurts me and my friends.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.856
I don't want you to think
I'm here because I'm a charity case.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.896
I am here because there is still
a big problem with the way

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.000
many people see individuals
with intellectual disabilities,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.256
or, too often,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.200
how they don't see them at all.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.120
Did you know the World Games
happened this year?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.096
I was one of over 6,500 athletes
with intellectual disabilities

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.936
from 165 countries who competed in LA.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.256
There was over 62,000 spectators
watching opening ceremonies,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.680
and there was live coverage
on TSN and ESPN.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.160
Did you even know that happened?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.320
What do you think of
when you see someone like me?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.536
I am here today to challenge you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.040
to look at us as equals.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.336
Special Olympics transforms
the self-identity of athletes

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.736
with intellectual disabilities

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.560
and the perceptions of everyone watching.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.296
For those of you who aren't familiar,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.920
Special Olympics is for athletes
with intellectual disabilities.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.280
Special Olympics is separate
from the Paralympics and Olympics.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.056
We offer high-quality,
year round sports programs

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.256
for people with intellectual disabilities

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.360
that changes lives and perceptions.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.056
This movement has changed my life

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.776
and those of so many others.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.696
And it has changed the way

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.840
the world sees people
with intellectual disabilities.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.920
I was born with epilepsy
and an intellectual disability.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.400
Growing up, I played hockey
until I was 12 years old.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.576
The older I got, the more I felt

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.976
it was harder to keep up
with everyone else,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.040
and I was angry and frustrated.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.296
For a while, I did not play any sports,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.216
didn't have many friends

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.000
and felt left out and sad.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.496
There was a time when people
with intellectual disabilities

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.440
were hidden away from society.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.056
No one thought they could
participate in sports,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.280
let alone be a valued member of society.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.616
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.935
a scientist at the University of Toronto,

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:37.616
was studying the effects
of regular exercise

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.640
on the fitness levels of children
with intellectual disabilities.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.096
Using rigorous scientific research,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.856
Dr. Hayden and other researchers

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.776
came to the conclusion

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.816
that it was simply the lack
of opportunity to participate

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.440
that caused their fitness
levels to suffer.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.776
Lots of people doubted
that people with intellectual disabilities

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.736
could benefit from fitness programs

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.600
and sports competition opportunities.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.856
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden
and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.176
the founder of Special Olympics,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.656
persevered,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.096
and Special Olympics athletes
have proved them right

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.680
four and a half million times over.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.336
(Applause)

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.576
Before I joined Special Olympics,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.096
I was nervous

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.336
because I was young, shy, not confident

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.040
and didn't have many friends.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.296
When I got there, though,
everyone was very encouraging,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.616
supportive, and let me be myself

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.320
without being judged.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.096
Now, I am a basketball player
and speed skater

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.936
who has competed
at provincial, national games,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.656
and this year made it all the way
to the World Summer Games in LA,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.496
where I was part of the first ever
Canadian basketball team

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.936
to compete at World Games.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.800
(Applause)

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.176
I am one of more than four and a half
million athletes around the globe,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.880
and I've heard so many similar stories.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.096
Being Special Olympics athletes

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.000
restores our pride and dignity.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.960
Special Olympics also addresses
critical health needs.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.416
Studies have shown that, on average,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.096
men with intellectual disabilities

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.616
die 13 years younger than men without,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.576
and women with intellectual disabilities

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.480
die 20 years younger than women without.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.416
Special Olympics keeps us healthy

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.216
by getting us active

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.080
and participating in sport.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.080
Also, our coaches teach us
about nutrition and health.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.336
Special Olympics also provides
free health screening

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.856
for athletes who have difficulty
communicating with their doctor

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.800
or accessing health care.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.216
At the 2015 World Summer Games,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.600
my Team Canada teammates and I
played the Nigerian basketball team.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.816
The day before our game,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.496
the Nigerian basketball team went to
the World Games Healthy Athlete screening,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.856
where seven of 10 members

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.376
were given hearing aids for free

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.880
and got to hear clearly
for the first time.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.200
(Applause)

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.440
The change in them was amazing.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.216
They were more excited,
happy and confident,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.920
because their coach could
vocally communicate with them.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.416
And they were emotional

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.296
because they could hear
the sounds of the basketball,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.296
the sounds of the whistle

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.096
and the cheering fans in the stands --

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.800
sounds that we take for granted.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.360
Special Olympics is transforming more
than just the athlete in their sport.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.880
Special Olympics is transforming
their lives off the field.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.616
This year, research findings showed

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.576
that nearly half of the adults in the US

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.679
don't know a single person
with an intellectual disability,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.056
and the 44 percent of Americans

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.496
who don't have personal contact
with intellectual disabilities

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.960
are significantly
less accepting and positive.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.176
Then there's the r-word,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.456
proving that people
with intellectual disabilities

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.296
are still invisible

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.200
to far too many people.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.080
People use it as a casual
term or an insult.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.760
It was tweeted more than
nine million times last year,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.296
and it is deeply hurtful

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.320
to me and my four and a half million
fellow athletes around the planet.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.976
People don't think it's insulting,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.200
but it is.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.056
As my fellow athlete and global messenger
John Franklin Stephens wrote

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.496
in an open letter to a political pundit

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.800
who used the r-word as an insult,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.520
"Come join us someday at Special Olympics.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.760
See if you walk away
with your heart unchanged."

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.920
(Applause)

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.936
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.896
people lined up for hours

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.120
to get into the final night
of powerlifting competition.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.336
So it was standing room only
when my teammate Jackie Barrett,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.136
the Newfoundland Moose,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.656
deadlifted 655 pounds

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.320
and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.840
(Applause)

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.000
setting huge new records
for Special Olympics.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.896
Jackie is a record holder
among all powerlifters in Newfoundland --

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.360
not just Special Olympics,
all powerlifters.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.736
Jackie was a huge star in LA,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.336
and ESPN live-tweeted
his record-breaking lifts

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.160
and were wowed by his performance.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.296
Fifty years ago, few imagined
individuals with intellectual disabilities

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.160
could do anything like that.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:13.440
This year, 60,000 spectators filled
the famous LA Memorial Coliseum

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.656
to watch the opening
ceremonies of World Games

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.456
and cheer athletes from 165 countries

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.760
around the world.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.056
Far from being hidden away,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.640
we were cheered and celebrated.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.736
Special Olympics teaches athletes

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.440
to be confident and proud of themselves.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.176
Special Olympics teaches the world

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.016
that people with intellectual disabilities

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.920
deserve respect and inclusion.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.680
(Applause)

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.896
Now, I have dreams
and achievements in my sport,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.536
great coaches,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.360
respect and dignity,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.216
better health,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.640
and I am pursuing a career
as a personal trainer.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.760
(Applause)

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.296
I am no longer hidden, bullied

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.016
and I am here doing a TED Talk.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.120
(Applause)

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.240
The world is a different place
because of Special Olympics,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.520
but there is still farther to go.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.416
So the next time you see someone
with an intellectual disability,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.520
I hope you will see their ability.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.616
The next time someone uses
the r-word near you,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.240
I hope you will tell them
how much it hurts.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.800
I hope you will think about getting
involved with Special Olympics.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.216
(Applause)

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.920
I would like to leave you
with one final thought.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.976
Nelson Mandela said,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.800
"Sports has the power
to change the world."

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.896
Special Olympics is changing the world

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.496
by transforming
four and a half million athletes
