00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:15.269
Hello.

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:18.713
This is my first trip,

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:22.975
first time in life I'm outside
of the walls of Gaza.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.111
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:31.059
(Applause)

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:36.587
My ambition always was
to be a pilot, to fly a plane,

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:41.193
to feel free to fly the sky,
to touch the sky.

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.192
But that didn't happen.

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:47.832
Simply, I live in Gaza,
there is no airport.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.244
All borders are closed on every side.

00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:56.426
We live in one of the biggest
prisons in the world.

00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:01.648
The only thing I can do
is just to look up to the sky.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.735
On some days, we are lucky
if we have electricity

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.497
for four or five hours.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.164
When it's cold, we make a fire
on the front or on the roof of our homes.

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:17.322
Sometimes we make food, too.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:23.296
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything
for journalists who come to my homeland

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.548
to tell the stories
about what's going on in Gaza.

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.208
Many mornings,
I had to go to the border area

00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:32.880
to collect a journalist.

00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:36.165
If anything should happen
to the journalist,

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.610
or if the journalist decides
to cover a story

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:43.332
the government doesn't want us to cover,

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:45.093
bad things could happen.

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.986
Navigating through my country
helping journalists,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.622
filmmakers, news crews,
is my working life.

00:01:55.607 --> 00:02:00.045
I believe my success comes
from building a relationship

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.340
not only with journalists
and the news crews,

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:06.481
but also with the communities
in the Gaza Strip.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:11.135
These communities who don't want
their stories to be told,

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.718
I never looked to them
as stories or numbers.

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:18.951
But like me, they are human beings.

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:26.108
I have built up
many relationships over 10 years.

00:02:26.582 --> 00:02:27.783
And guess what?

00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:31.601
This gives me the chance
to get access to people,

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.894
to stories that others can't.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:39.587
In some certain situations,
I feel, as a woman, I have more power.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.049
Many male journalists in my society,

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:48.350
they want to cover a story
about drug addiction in my country.

00:02:48.692 --> 00:02:53.390
That problem started
when the Gaza tunnel was being built.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.593
With the siege on Gaza,

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:59.252
tunnels brought people all the basic needs

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.764
like food, building material,
other stuff we needed.

00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:07.574
But not anymore, because the Egyptian side
flooded them up with water

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:09.795
and they are not working anymore.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.501
Drugs were being smuggled,

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.795
and many young people got addicted, too.

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:20.063
In the tradition
of the Palestinian society,

00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:23.699
it's forbidden for men
to enter the household.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.394
So, no male journalists get the story.

00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:28.632
But I did.

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:33.844
I have a wonderful husband,

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:36.670
a wonderful husband who supports me

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:40.479
despite all the criticism
he gets from the society.

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:43.552
He's at home now with my two kids,

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:46.266
and I have another one
that's growing in here.

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:52.044
(Applause)

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:55.939
When I'm working,
I call him every two hours,

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:59.753
and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,

00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:01.204
he should call my contact,

00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:04.390
the one who gives me access to the story,

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:07.004
which is the one who I trust.

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:11.130
One of the times in Gaza,

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:16.093
during the kidnapping
of the British journalist Alan Johnston,

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:20.016
I was asked by an American magazine

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.942
to set up a meeting
with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:29.323
The journalist covering the story and I

00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:32.376
were asked to meet outside of his hotel.

00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:38.738
They came, they picked us up
in a black van with black windows,

00:04:38.762 --> 00:04:41.463
they were wearing masks on that day.

00:04:43.136 --> 00:04:48.947
And they drove us away,
far away in the middle of a field.

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.431
They took our cell phones

00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:56.375
and we did the interview
with the kidnapper outside in that field.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.359
I was so scared that day,

00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:01.906
a day I will never forget.

00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:06.514
So, why do I do what I do?

00:05:07.044 --> 00:05:10.363
I do it because I believe if I didn't,

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:14.942
a huge part of the story
about Gaza will be missing.

00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:20.126
There are some more stories
I could tell you about my country.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.426
And not all of them are bad.

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:27.564
I love my country, despite
the terrible situation we live in --

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:31.507
siege, poverty, unemployment --

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.900
but there is life.

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:39.210
There are people who are dreamers
and amazing people full of energy.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.105
We have wonderful music,
and a great music school.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.309
We have parkour dancers
who dance in the rubble of their homes.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.898
And Gaza is the only place
in the Arab world

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:57.317
where Muslims and Christians
live in strong brotherhood.

00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:03.660
(Applause)

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:05.232
During the time of war,

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:09.328
the hardest part for me
is leaving the house early in the morning,

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.022
leaving my children.

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:15.379
I take a picture of them everyday

00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:18.680
because I never know
if I will make it back to them.

00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:25.817
Being a fixer and a journalist
is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.211
But when I hear the sound of the shelling
or the sound of the bombing,

00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:33.173
I just head straight toward it,

00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:37.173
because I want to be there first,

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:41.094
because these stories should be told.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:48.352
When my children were small
and we heard the sound of the war,

00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:52.214
I used to tell them
that they were fireworks.

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:55.336
Now they are older, they understand.

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:59.660
I do have terrible nightmares

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:03.898
because of all that I witnessed
during war times,

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:08.177
especially these lifeless bodies
of young children.

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:12.479
I still remember a little girl,
her name is Hala.

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:15.233
She's the only survivor from her family.

00:07:15.806 --> 00:07:18.878
Her picture will be with me forever.

00:07:18.902 --> 00:07:21.270
I will never forget her.

00:07:24.738 --> 00:07:29.485
I'm proud that I can stand here
and be here today with you.

00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:36.659
I'm proud that I can tell you
stories, sad and happy,

00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:41.161
stories about my small corner
of the world, Gaza.

00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:46.174
I'm proud that I am
the first female fixer working in Gaza.

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:49.828
And the funny thing is
they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.653
(Laughter)

00:07:52.677 --> 00:07:57.626
I hope one day, I will get the chance
to tell the stories of all other women,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.163
all other amazing women
I know in my country.

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:05.204
I hope that one day
I can help other women in my country

00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:07.416
to be fixers like me.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.748
And of course sometimes,
I feel I can't do this work anymore,

00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:14.017
it's just too much for me.

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.579
But I remember these words:

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:20.149
"Don't limit your challenge,
but challenge your limit.

00:08:20.173 --> 00:08:24.243
Don't allow others to stand
in front of your dreams."

00:08:25.502 --> 00:08:26.663
Thank you.

00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:33.687
(Applause)
