00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:14.309
Hello, everybody.

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.976
I brought with me today a baby diaper.

00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:20.515
You'll see why in a second.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.549
Baby diapers have interesting properties.

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.264
They can swell enormously
when you add water to them,

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:28.272
an experiment done
by millions of kids every day.

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:29.446
(Laughter)

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.964
But the reason why

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.178
is that they're designed
in a very clever way.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:35.837
They're made out of a thing
called a swellable material.

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.598
It's a special kind of material that,
when you add water,

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:40.052
it will swell up enormously,

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:42.242
maybe a thousand times in volume.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.502
And this is a very useful,
industrial kind of polymer.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.345
But what we're trying to do
in my group at MIT

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:51.582
is to figure out if we can do
something similar to the brain.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:52.765
Can we make it bigger,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.467
big enough that you
can peer inside

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.109
and see all the tiny building blocks,
the biomolecules,

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.284
how they're organized in three dimensions,

00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:02.793
the structure, the ground truth
structure of the brain, if you will?

00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:03.975
If we could get that,

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.508
maybe we could have a better understanding
of how the brain is organized

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:09.191
to yield thoughts and emotions

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:10.934
and actions and sensations.

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.373
Maybe we could try to pinpoint
the exact changes in the brain

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:16.173
that result in diseases,

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:19.409
diseases like Alzheimer's
and epilepsy and Parkinson's,

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.011
for which there are few
treatments, much less cures,

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:25.652
and for which, very often,
we don't know the cause or the origins

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:27.811
and what's really causing them to occur.

00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:30.353
Now, our group at MIT

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:33.063
is trying to take
a different point of view

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:36.317
from the way neuroscience has
been done over the last hundred years.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.920
We're designers. We're inventors.

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:40.488
We're trying to figure out
how to build technologies

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:42.968
that let us look at and repair the brain.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:44.143
And the reason is,

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.968
the brain is incredibly,
incredibly complicated.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:50.371
So what we've learned
over the first century of neuroscience

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:52.698
is that the brain is a very
complicated network,

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:55.202
made out of very specialized
cells called neurons

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:56.893
with very complex geometries,

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:01.154
and electrical currents will flow
through these complexly shaped neurons.

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:04.437
Furthermore, neurons
are connected in networks.

00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:08.296
They're connected by little junctions
called synapses that exchange chemicals

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.538
and allow the neurons
to talk to each other.

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:12.502
The density of the brain is incredible.

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.833
In a cubic millimeter of your brain,

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:17.314
there are about 100,000 of these neurons

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.855
and maybe a billion of those connections.

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.269
But it's worse.

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:24.598
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,

00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:27.372
and, of course, this is just
our artist's rendition of it.

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:31.603
What you would see are thousands
and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:36.027
little nanoscale machines
organized in complex, 3D patterns,

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.679
and together they mediate
those electrical pulses,

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:42.640
those chemical exchanges
that allow neurons to work together

00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:46.333
to generate things like thoughts
and feelings and so forth.

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:50.121
Now, we don't know how
the neurons in the brain are organized

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:51.319
to form networks,

00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:53.843
and we don't know how
the biomolecules are organized

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:55.041
within neurons

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.470
to form these complex, organized machines.

00:02:57.918 --> 00:02:59.738
If we really want to understand this,

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.579
we're going to need new technologies.

00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:03.387
But if we could get such maps,

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.354
if we could look at the organization
of molecules and neurons

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:07.944
and neurons and networks,

00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:11.405
maybe we could really understand
how the brain conducts information

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.596
from sensory regions,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.356
mixes it with emotion and feeling,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.774
and generates our decisions and actions.

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:20.920
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set
of molecular changes that occur

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:22.146
in a brain disorder.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.992
And once we know how
those molecules have changed,

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:27.796
whether they've increased in number
or changed in pattern,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.759
we could use those
as targets for new drugs,

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.054
for new ways of delivering
energy into the brain

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:36.958
in order to repair the brain
computations that are afflicted

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:39.281
in patients who suffer
from brain disorders.

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:43.036
We've all seen lots of different
technologies over the last century

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.226
to try to confront this.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.130
I think we've all seen brain scans

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:48.188
taken using MRI machines.

00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:51.559
These, of course, have the great power
that they are noninvasive,

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:53.938
they can be used on living human subjects.

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.638
But also, they're spatially crude.

00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:59.652
Each of these blobs that you see,
or voxels, as they're called,

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:02.365
can contain millions
and millions of neurons.

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.239
So it's not at the level of resolution

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:06.801
where it can pinpoint
the molecular changes that occur

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:09.111
or the changes in the wiring
of these networks

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:13.081
that contributes to our ability
to be conscious and powerful beings.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:16.978
At the other extreme,
you have microscopes.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.297
Microscopes, of course, will use light
to look at little tiny things.

00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:23.396
For centuries, they've been used
to look at things like bacteria.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.571
For neuroscience,

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:28.007
microscopes are actually how neurons
were discovered in the first place,

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.323
about 130 years ago.

00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:31.665
But light is fundamentally limited.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.987
You can't see individual molecules
with a regular old microscope.

00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.163
You can't look at these tiny connections.

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:41.129
So if we want to make our ability
to see the brain more powerful,

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:43.321
to get down to the ground truth structure,

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:46.625
we're going to need to have
even better technologies.

00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:49.835
My group, a couple years ago,
started thinking:

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:51.271
Why don't we do the opposite?

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:53.756
If it's so darn complicated
to zoom in to the brain,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.723
why can't we make the brain bigger?

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:57.321
It initially started

00:04:57.345 --> 00:05:00.341
with two grad students in my group,
Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.085
Now many others in my group
are helping with this process.

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:05.871
We decided to try to figure out
if we could take polymers,

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:07.524
like the stuff in the baby diaper,

00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:09.554
and install it physically
within the brain.

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:11.819
If we could do it just right,
and you add water,

00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:13.678
you can potentially blow the brain up

00:05:13.702 --> 00:05:17.079
to where you could distinguish
those tiny biomolecules from each other.

00:05:17.103 --> 00:05:19.973
You would see those connections
and get maps of the brain.

00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:21.985
This could potentially be quite dramatic.

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.017
We brought a little demo here.

00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:28.113
We got some purified baby diaper material.

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:30.411
It's much easier
just to buy it off the Internet

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:33.910
than to extract the few grains
that actually occur in these diapers.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.159
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.500
of this purified polymer.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.422
And here we have some water.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:42.608
What we're going to do

00:05:42.632 --> 00:05:45.643
is see if this teaspoon
of the baby diaper material

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:47.376
can increase in size.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:52.383
You're going to see it increase in volume
by about a thousandfold

00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:53.693
before your very eyes.

00:06:01.597 --> 00:06:03.569
I could pour much more of this in there,

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:05.151
but I think you've got the idea

00:06:05.175 --> 00:06:07.677
that this is a very,
very interesting molecule,

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.613
and if can use it in the right way,

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:11.958
we might be able
to really zoom in on the brain

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:14.576
in a way that you can't do
with past technologies.

00:06:15.227 --> 00:06:17.281
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.747
What's going on
in the baby diaper polymer?

00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:21.447
If you could zoom in,

00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.144
it might look something like
what you see on the screen.

00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:28.660
Polymers are chains of atoms
arranged in long, thin lines.

00:06:28.684 --> 00:06:30.051
The chains are very tiny,

00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:31.939
about the width of a biomolecule,

00:06:31.963 --> 00:06:33.710
and these polymers are really dense.

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.234
They're separated by distances

00:06:35.258 --> 00:06:37.510
that are around the size of a biomolecule.

00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:38.699
This is very good

00:06:38.723 --> 00:06:41.764
because we could potentially
move everything apart in the brain.

00:06:41.788 --> 00:06:43.636
If we add water, what will happen is,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.175
this swellable material
is going to absorb the water,

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.599
the polymer chains will move
apart from each other,

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:51.257
and the entire material
is going to become bigger.

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:53.429
And because these chains are so tiny

00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:55.658
and spaced by biomolecular distances,

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.721
we could potentially blow up the brain

00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.378
and make it big enough to see.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.260
Here's the mystery, then:

00:07:01.284 --> 00:07:04.894
How do we actually make
these polymer chains inside the brain

00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:07.157
so we can move all the biomolecules apart?

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:08.332
If we could do that,

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.753
maybe we could get
ground truth maps of the brain.

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.166
We could look at the wiring.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.347
We can peer inside
and see the molecules within.

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.406
To explain this, we made some animations

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.033
where we actually look
at, in these artist renderings,

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:24.598
what biomolecules might look
like and how we might separate them.

00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:27.171
Step one: what we'd have
to do, first of all,

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.584
is attach every biomolecule,
shown in brown here,

00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:32.767
to a little anchor, a little handle.

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:35.886
We need to pull the molecules
of the brain apart from each other,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.236
and to do that, we need
to have a little handle

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.545
that allows those polymers to bind to them

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.111
and to exert their force.

00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.439
Now, if you just take baby diaper
polymer and dump it on the brain,

00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:48.500
obviously, it's going to sit there on top.

00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:51.052
So we need to find a way
to make the polymers inside.

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:52.864
And this is where we're really lucky.

00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:55.076
It turns out, you can
get the building blocks,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.472
monomers, as they're called,

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.280
and if you let them go into the brain

00:07:58.304 --> 00:08:00.340
and then trigger the chemical reactions,

00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:03.066
you can get them to form
those long chains,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.888
right there inside the brain tissue.

00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.722
They're going to wind their way
around biomolecules

00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:08.967
and between biomolecules,

00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.616
forming those complex webs

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.502
that will allow you, eventually,
to pull apart the molecules

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.701
from each other.

00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:17.779
And every time one
of those little handles is around,

00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:21.153
the polymer will bind to the handle,
and that's exactly what we need

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:23.708
in order to pull the molecules
apart from each other.

00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:25.425
All right, the moment of truth.

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.597
We have to treat this specimen

00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:31.067
with a chemical to kind of loosen up
all the molecules from each other,

00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:32.927
and then, when we add water,

00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:35.904
that swellable material is going
to start absorbing the water,

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:37.631
the polymer chains will move apart,

00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:40.377
but now, the biomolecules
will come along for the ride.

00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:42.565
And much like drawing
a picture on a balloon,

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:44.176
and then you blow up the balloon,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.490
the image is the same,

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:48.062
but the ink particles have moved
away from each other.

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:51.553
And that's what we've been able
to do now, but in three dimensions.

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:53.576
There's one last trick.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.818
As you can see here,

00:08:54.842 --> 00:08:56.951
we've color-coded
all the biomolecules brown.

00:08:56.975 --> 00:08:59.145
That's because they all
kind of look the same.

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.274
Biomolecules are made
out of the same atoms,

00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:03.538
but just in different orders.

00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:05.062
So we need one last thing

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.781
in order to make them visible.

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:08.384
We have to bring in little tags,

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:11.427
with glowing dyes
that will distinguish them.

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:14.124
So one kind of biomolecule
might get a blue color.

00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:16.499
Another kind of biomolecule
might get a red color.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.799
And so forth.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.375
And that's the final step.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.677
Now we can look at something like a brain

00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:23.497
and look at the individual molecules,

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.228
because we've moved them
far apart enough from each other

00:09:26.252 --> 00:09:27.950
that we can tell them apart.

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.808
So the hope here is that
we can make the invisible visible.

00:09:30.832 --> 00:09:33.398
We can turn things that might seem
small and obscure

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:34.573
and blow them up

00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:37.774
until they're like constellations
of information about life.

00:09:37.798 --> 00:09:40.173
Here's an actual video
of what it might look like.

00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:42.568
We have here a little brain in a dish --

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:44.339
a little piece of a brain, actually.

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:45.959
We've infused the polymer in,

00:09:45.983 --> 00:09:47.450
and now we're adding water.

00:09:47.474 --> 00:09:49.832
What you'll see is that,
right before your eyes --

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.779
this video is sped up about sixtyfold --

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:54.528
this little piece of brain tissue
is going to grow.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.732
It can increase by a hundredfold
or even more in volume.

00:09:57.756 --> 00:10:00.705
And the cool part is, because
those polymers are so tiny,

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:03.288
we're separating biomolecules
evenly from each other.

00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:04.970
It's a smooth expansion.

00:10:04.994 --> 00:10:07.681
We're not losing the configuration
of the information.

00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:10.405
We're just making it easier to see.

00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:13.509
So now we can take
actual brain circuitry --

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:16.667
here's a piece of the brain
involved with, for example, memory --

00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:17.954
and we can zoom in.

00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:20.868
We can start to actually look at
how circuits are configured.

00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:22.860
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.

00:10:22.884 --> 00:10:25.663
Maybe we could actually look
at how circuits are configured

00:10:25.687 --> 00:10:26.839
to process emotions,

00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:29.785
how the actual wiring
of our brain is organized

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.376
in order to make us who we are.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.447
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,

00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:37.630
the actual problems in the brain
at a molecular level.

00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:40.223
What if we could actually
look into cells in the brain

00:10:40.247 --> 00:10:43.330
and figure out, wow, here are the 17
molecules that have altered

00:10:43.354 --> 00:10:46.809
in this brain tissue that has been
undergoing epilepsy

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:48.483
or changing in Parkinson's disease

00:10:48.507 --> 00:10:50.024
or otherwise being altered?

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:53.091
If we get that systematic list
of things that are going wrong,

00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.314
those become our therapeutic targets.

00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:57.015
We can build drugs that bind those.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:59.666
We can maybe aim energy
at different parts of the brain

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.377
in order to help people
with Parkinson's or epilepsy

00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.952
or other conditions that affect
over a billion people

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:06.189
around the world.

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:09.452
Now, something interesting
has been happening.

00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:12.181
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.871
there are other problems
that expansion might help with.

00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:18.129
This is an actual biopsy
from a human breast cancer patient.

00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:20.693
It turns out that if you look at cancers,

00:11:20.717 --> 00:11:22.328
if you look at the immune system,

00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:24.865
if you look at aging,
if you look at development --

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:29.386
all these processes are involving
large-scale biological systems.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.434
But of course, the problems begin
with those little nanoscale molecules,

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:37.327
the machines that make the cells
and the organs in our body tick.

00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:39.573
So what we're trying
to do now is to figure out

00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:43.063
if we can actually use this technology
to map the building blocks of life

00:11:43.087 --> 00:11:44.832
in a wide variety of diseases.

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:47.752
Can we actually pinpoint
the molecular changes in a tumor

00:11:47.776 --> 00:11:50.145
so that we can actually
go after it in a smart way

00:11:50.169 --> 00:11:54.113
and deliver drugs that might wipe out
exactly the cells that we want to?

00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:56.472
You know, a lot of medicine
is very high risk.

00:11:56.496 --> 00:11:58.278
Sometimes, it's even guesswork.

00:11:58.626 --> 00:12:02.501
My hope is we can actually turn
what might be a high-risk moon shot

00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:04.294
into something that's more reliable.

00:12:04.318 --> 00:12:06.373
If you think about the original moon shot,

00:12:06.397 --> 00:12:08.295
where they actually landed on the moon,

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:09.763
it was based on solid science.

00:12:09.787 --> 00:12:11.390
We understood gravity;

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:12.755
we understood aerodynamics.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.174
We knew how to build rockets.

00:12:14.198 --> 00:12:16.666
The science risk was under control.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.443
It was still a great, great
feat of engineering.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:22.112
But in medicine, we don't
necessarily have all the laws.

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:25.245
Do we have all the laws
that are analogous to gravity,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:27.613
that are analogous to aerodynamics?

00:12:27.637 --> 00:12:29.367
I would argue that with technologies

00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:31.263
like the kinds I'm talking about today,

00:12:31.287 --> 00:12:32.980
maybe we can actually derive those.

00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:35.861
We can map the patterns
that occur in living systems,

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:40.443
and figure out how to overcome
the diseases that plague us.

00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:43.578
You know, my wife and I
have two young kids,

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:46.836
and one of my hopes as a bioengineer
is to make life better for them

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.589
than it currently is for us.

00:12:48.613 --> 00:12:52.343
And my hope is, if we can
turn biology and medicine

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:56.724
from these high-risk endeavors
that are governed by chance and luck,

00:12:56.748 --> 00:13:00.675
and make them things
that we win by skill and hard work,

00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:02.597
then that would be a great advance.

00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:03.827
Thank you very much.

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:14.234
(Applause)
