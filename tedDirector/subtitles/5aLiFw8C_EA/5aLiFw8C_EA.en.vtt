00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260
I want to talk about penguins today.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
But first, I want to start by saying that

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
we need a new operating system,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
for the oceans and for the Earth.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
there were 3,000 people

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that lived in the Galapagos.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
Now there are over 30,000.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Now, there are around a thousand trucks

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
and buses and cars there.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
So the fundamental problems that we face

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
are overconsumption and too many people.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
It's the same problems in the Galapagos,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
except, obviously,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
but we have 6.7 billion people in the world,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and we all like to consume.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
And one of the major problems that we have

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
is our operating system

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
is not giving us the proper feedback.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
We're not paying the true

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
environmental costs of our actions.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
let me just say, that I had never

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
camped before.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I had never lived alone

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
for any period of time,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
and I'd never slept with sea lions

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
snoring next to me all night.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
and we call it uninhabited

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
because there are no people there.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
But it's alive with life;

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
it's hardly uninhabited.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
is the importance of wild places, wild things,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
certainly wildlife,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and the amazing qualities that penguins have.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
Penguins are real athletes:

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
They can swim at the same speed day and night --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260
and sustain it.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Emperor penguins can go down

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
more than 500 meters

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.260
they can dive to about 90 meters

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260
and they can stay down for

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
about 4.6 minutes.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And I doubt anybody in this room

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
You have to train to be able to do that.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
So penguins are amazing athletes.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
The other thing is, I've never met anybody

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
that really doesn't say that they like penguins.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
They're comical, they walk upright,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
and, of course, they're diligent.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So they have all the criteria

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
that people normally like.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
and particularly the ocean.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
And that's what I came to study.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
but you already know

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260
penguins are rare.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
These are the rarest penguins in the world.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260
But the population has changed

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
dramatically since I was first here.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
When I counted penguins for the first time

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
and tried to do a census,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
we just counted all the individual beaks that we could

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
around all these islands.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
but I know I can count 2,000.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
If you go and do it now, the national parks

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
count about 500.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
So we have a quarter of the penguins

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
that we did 40 years ago.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
And this is true of most of our living systems.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
We have less than we had before,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
and most of them are in fairly steep decline.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
And I want to just show you a little bit about why.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.260
(Braying)

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.260
That's a penguin braying

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
to tell you that

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
it's important to pay attention to penguins.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
Most important of all,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
I fell in love with penguins,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260
What I found out I was studying

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.260
is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
the most extreme variation.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260
You've heard about these El Ninos,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.260
but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
have to adapt to.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
This is a cold-water event

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260
called La Nina.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260
Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
And so you can see this current coming up --

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
in this case, the Humboldt Current --

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
that upwells around the Galapagos.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
That brings all the nutrients:

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.260
When this is cold in the Galapagos,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260
it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
When we have extreme El Nino events,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.260
you see all this red,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260
and you see no green

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
out here around the Galapagos.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
That means that there's no upwelling,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
and there's basically no food.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
So it's a real desert

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
things die when there's no food.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
But we didn't even know that that

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.260
affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
and you're in the middle of an El Nino event

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and there are no penguins.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
They're not breeding; they're not even around.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
I studied marine iguanas at that point.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
at a place called Punta Tombo --

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
down here about 44 degrees south latitude --

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
you see that there's great variation here.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
Some years, the cold water

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
goes all the way up to Brazil,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.260
So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260
but that is the kind of variation

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
that penguins have to live with,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and it's not easy.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
I didn't have any problems.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
There were plenty of them.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
showing all the penguins along the beach.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
and turning them into high fashion golf gloves,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
protein and oil.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.260
and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
But the population is declining

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.260
and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.260
since 1987, when I started these surveys,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
in terms of number of active nests.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.260
We know this because of long-term science,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260
because we have long-term studies there.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.260
And science is important in informing decision makers,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
and also in changing how we do

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.260
and knowing the direction of change that we're going in.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.260
And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
has funded me along with a lot of individuals

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
over the last 27 years

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
to be able to produce these kinds of maps.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
And also, we know that it's not only

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
Galapagos penguins that are in trouble,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.260
And so we have started a global penguin society

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.260
to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
Penguins don't like oil

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
and they don't like to swim through oil.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260
The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
But, in fact, when we went to Argentina,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
penguins were often found

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.260
totally covered in oil.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So they were just minding their own business.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
Because when tankers carry oil

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
they have to have ballast at some point,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
When they come back, they actually dump

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
this oily ballast water into the ocean.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
because they don't pay the real environmental costs.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
We usually don't, and we want to start

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
getting the accounting system right

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
so we can pay the real cost.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
We have laws,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So we ended up spending nine years

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
In some years, like this year, we found

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
more than 80 percent

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
of the adult penguins dead on the beach

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
were covered in oil.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
These little blue dots are the fledglings --

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
we do this survey every March --

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
which means that they're only in the environment

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.260
from January until March,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.260
so maybe three months at the most

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260
that they could get covered in oil.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.260
of the fledglings were oiled.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Eventually, the government listened

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
and, amazingly, they changed their laws.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
They moved the tanker lanes

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.260
40 kilometers farther off shore,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.260
So what we're seeing now

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
is very few penguins are oiled.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
Why are there even these penguins oiled?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.260
which is like a state in Argentina

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
where Punta Tombo is --

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline --

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.260
but we haven't solved the problem

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260
in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
I'm just going to talk about two things.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.260
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.260
because I put satellite tags on the back

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.260
of these Magellanic penguins.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260
to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.260
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
We thought we needed a marine protected area

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
of about 30 kilometers,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
And what the penguins show us --

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
and these are all the little dots

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
from where the penguins' positions were

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
for penguins in incubation in 2003 --

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.260
and what you see is some of these individuals

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.260
are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
So that means as their mate

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.260
is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.260
the other one is out there foraging,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.260
and the longer they have to stay gone,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
and you can't raise a lot of chicks.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
Here you see in 2003 --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
these are all the dots of where the penguins are --

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
they were raising a little over

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
a half of a chick.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
Here, you can see in 2006,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.260
they raised almost three quarters

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
of a chick per nest,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
they're not going as far away.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
This past year, in 2009,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.260
you can see that they're now raising

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.260
about a fourth of a chick,

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.260
and some of these individuals are going

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
and then you get transferred

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
to St. Louis,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
and your mate is not happy about this

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
because you've got to pay airfare,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
because you're gone longer.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260
The same thing's true for penguins as well.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And they're going about, on average now,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.260
40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
We need to be able to get information out to the general public.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
And so we started a publication

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
with the Society for Conservation

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
that we think presents cutting-edge science

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
in a new, novel way,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.260
because we have reporters that are good writers

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
that actually can distill the information

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260
and make it accessible to the general public.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
So if you're interested in cutting-edge science

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
and smarter conservation,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.260
you should join with our 11 partners --

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.260
some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy --

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
and look at this magazine

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
because we need to get information out about conservation

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
to the general public.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.260
Lastly I want to say that

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
all of you, probably,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
have had some relationship at some time in your life

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.260
with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
and you recognized that those are individuals.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And some of you consider them almost part of your family.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.260
If you had a relationship with a penguin,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260
you'd see it in the same sort of way.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
They're amazing creatures

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
that really change how you view the world

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
because they're not that different from us:

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
They're trying to make a living,

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
they're trying to raise their offspring,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
they're trying to get on and survive in the world.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260
This is Turbo the Penguin.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
Turbo's never been fed.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
He met us and got his name

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
because he started standing under

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
my diesel truck: a turbo truck,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
so we named him Turbo.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
we let him in and he comes in here.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And I just wanted to show you

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.260
what happened one day

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
when Turbo brought in a friend.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
So this is Turbo.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
which he would do to a female penguin.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
This guy has never been in before

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.260
and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
What is this guy doing?

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.260
This is really pretty weird."

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.260
And you'll see soon

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
that my graduate student ...

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
on his flipper patting.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And now he's looking at the other guy,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
saying, "You are really weird."

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And now look at this: not friendly.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
So penguins really differ in their personalities

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
just like our dogs and our cats.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
We're also trying to collect our information

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.260
and become more technologically literate.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
So we're trying to put that

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.260
in computers in the field.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.260
And penguins are always involved in helping us

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.260
or not helping us in one way or another.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.260
This is a radio frequency ID system.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.260
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.260
See, this one's coming back to its nest.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.260
They're all coming in at this time,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.260
She's really rushing back, because it's hot,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.260
to try to feed her chicks.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Then I realize that they're playing

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.260
king of the box.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.260
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.260
You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.260
does not like that wire.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.260
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
(Laughter)

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.260
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
OK.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Most important thing is:

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.260
Only you can change yourself,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.260
and only you can change the world

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.260
and make it better, for people

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.260
as well as penguins.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.260
So, thank you very much. (Applause)
