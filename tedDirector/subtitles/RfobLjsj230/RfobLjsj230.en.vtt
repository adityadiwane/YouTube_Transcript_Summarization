00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the lights are really disturbing my eyes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and they're reflecting on my glasses.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I am very happy and honored to be amidst

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
very, very innovative and intelligent people.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I have listened to the three previous speakers,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and guess what happened?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(Laughter)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But there is a saying in my culture

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that bud is a young one.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I still will say something.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because another conference is taking place in Berlin.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It is the G8 Summit.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
should be a massive increase in aid,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
something akin to the Marshall Plan.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Its largest recipients were Germany and France,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
An average African country receives foreign aid

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
from rich countries to poor countries.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
although they're part and parcel of our African reality,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
they are not the only reality.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Africa has 53 nations.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We have civil wars only in six countries,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which means that the media are covering only six countries.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
through the web of despair and helplessness

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that the Western media largely presents to its audience.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And, as a consequence, the Western view

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The wrong framing is a product of thinking

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that Africa is a place of despair.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We should send peacekeeping troops

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to serve those who are facing a civil war.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I want to say that it is important to recognize

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
from a challenge of despair,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which is called poverty reduction,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to a challenge of hope.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is not the challenge of reducing poverty.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Once we change those two things --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you have the international cartel of good intentions

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
moving onto the continent, with what?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And in the process, none of these things really are productive

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of Africa's fundamental problems.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
our second challenge will be,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So, where should we be putting the money?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We need to put money where it can productively grow.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Support research institutions,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
for primary education, for food relief.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The entire continent has been turned into

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a place of despair, in need of charity.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
who became rich by receiving charity?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the generosity and kindness of another?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
it appears that what I'm stating is true.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
(Bono: Yes!)

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Which country is that?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Bono: It's an Irish land.)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
(Bono: [unclear])

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
depends on your internal capacity.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Africa has received many opportunities.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Many of them we haven't benefited much.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and policy framework that can make it possible for us

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Under the Cotonou Agreement,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
formerly known as the Lome Convention,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
of sugar to the European Union market.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
African countries that produce beef

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
has ever met its quota.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
inability to engage the rest of the world

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in a more productive relationship

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And all forms of intervention need support,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Why should people support their government?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to profit from corruption.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The fact is no government in the world,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
If the government's fiscal survival

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
depends on it having to raise money from its own people,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
such a government is driven by self-interest

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to govern in a more enlightened fashion.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It will sit with those who create wealth.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The problem with the African continent

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the problem with the aid industry

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
facing the governments in Africa.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
does not lie in the domestic economy,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
it lies with international donors.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Rather than sit with Ugandan --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
(Applause) --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
our governments find it more productive

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the incentives necessary to expand a business --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
by the international community, to avoid building

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
productive arrangements with your own citizens,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that tell them what its citizens need.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
implementation process in our countries.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
has taken over our rights as citizens,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But I want to put a caveat on my argument,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It may have built a road, and that road

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
may have served a very good role.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The mistake of the international aid industry

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is to pick these isolated incidents of success,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and then spread them across the whole world,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the skills, the practices, the norms and habits

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and therefore generalize this experience

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
as the experience of everybody.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Aid increases the resources available to governments,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Governments are not changing it. Why?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They talk to international donors.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
precisely because we depend on aid.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I also want to say that it is important for us to

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
from the international community,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and all other forms of aid.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Where has all the aid gone?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
of its own revenue?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
But this shows you that the government of Uganda

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is not committed to spending its own revenue

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to invest in productive investments,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but rather it devotes this revenue

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
to paying structure of public expenditure.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The military, 380 billion.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
takes only 18 billion.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And let me show you, what does public expenditure --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
by the way, who never see the president, except on television.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(Applause)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and even there, it is him who advises them.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
(Laughter)

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We have 81 units of local government.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Each local government is organized like the central government --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
There were 56, and when our president wanted to

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
amend the constitution and remove term limits,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
One hundred thirty-four commissions

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and semi-autonomous government bodies,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
A recent government of Uganda study found

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
at the Minister of Health headquarters.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
none of which has an ambulance.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It should be short enough to arouse interest,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
but long enough to cover the subject.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I hope I have achieved that.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
(Laughter)

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
(Applause)
