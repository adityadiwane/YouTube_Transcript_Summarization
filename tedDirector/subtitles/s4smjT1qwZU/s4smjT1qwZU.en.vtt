00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.615
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:21.527
It's a diagram of the visual system.

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:24.277
And some things look very familiar today.

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:28.644
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.764
There's a very large nose

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.081
that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.781
And if we compare this

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.855
to more recent representations of the visual system,

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:40.812
you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated

00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:42.385
over the intervening thousand years.

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.350
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.831
rather than just looking at its overall shape.

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.810
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.989
and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.385
You really would be kind of out of luck.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.427
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open,

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.271
look at the wiring inside.

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.135
And up until a little more than a century ago,

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.135
nobody was able to do that with the brain.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.015
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:09.967
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:11.656
and you cut a thin slice of it,

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:14.154
put it under even a very powerful microscope,

00:01:14.154 --> 00:01:15.335
there's nothing there.

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:16.948
It's gray, formless.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:19.552
There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:22.406
And this all changed in the late 19th century.

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:26.281
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.093
and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:31.106
The computer was cracked open.

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:33.962
So what really launched modern neuroscience

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:35.927
was a stain called the Golgi stain.

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:37.808
And it works in a very particular way.

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:40.918
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,

00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:43.950
it somehow only stains about one percent of them.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.292
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.964
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.010
So somehow it shows what's there.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.677
Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:57.522
who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,

00:01:57.522 --> 00:02:01.419
applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:05.177
and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.

00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:07.791
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:09.802
this is the transistor.

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:11.877
And very quickly Cajal realized

00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:14.214
that neurons don't operate alone,

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.052
but rather make connections with others

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:18.558
that form circuits just like in a computer.

00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:21.949
Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.716
they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:25.866
And there's several ways of doing this.

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.593
But one of the most popular ones

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:29.685
involves green fluorescent protein.

00:02:29.685 --> 00:02:31.344
Now green fluorescent protein,

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:34.489
which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.727
is very useful.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:38.365
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:40.040
and deliver it to a cell,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.787
that cell will glow green --

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:45.533
or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.197
you get a cell to glow many different colors.

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:48.718
And so coming back to the brain,

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:52.518
this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."

00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:54.068
And it's so called, of course,

00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:57.680
because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.131
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:04.175
individual molecular components of neurons, molecules,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:05.973
rather than the entire cell.

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:07.679
And there's several ways of doing this,

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.148
but one of the most popular ones

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:11.343
involves using antibodies.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:12.680
And you're familiar, of course,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.631
with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:18.049
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.599
because they can recognize specific molecules,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.718
like, for example, the coat protein

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.106
of a virus that's invading the body.

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:27.151
And researchers have used this fact

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:31.476
in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:34.116
recognize specific substructures of the cell

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:36.360
and identify them individually.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.385
And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.291
but they're also very powerful.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.927
They have great explanatory power.

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:45.017
This, for example, is an antibody staining

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:48.537
against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.

00:03:48.537 --> 00:03:50.218
And you've heard of serotonin, of course,

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:53.045
in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.453
You've heard of SSRIs,

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:57.350
which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.240
And in order to understand how serotonin works,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.316
it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:04.912
And antibody stainings like this one

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:08.458
can be used to understand that sort of question.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.016
I'd like to leave you with the following thought:

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.626
Green fluorescent protein and antibodies

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:16.633
are both totally natural products at the get-go.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.412
They were evolved by nature

00:04:19.412 --> 00:04:21.979
in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.362
or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.

00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:29.379
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.402
and say, "Hey, these are tools,

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:33.515
these are functions that we could use

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:35.523
in our own research tool palette."

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:39.151
And instead of applying feeble human minds

00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.035
to designing these tools from scratch,

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:43.939
there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.175
developed and refined steadily for millions of years

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:48.875
by the greatest engineer of all.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.137
Thank you.

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:52.675
(Applause)
